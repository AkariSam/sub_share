1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,290
You shouldn't be a soldier anymore.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,160
You wouldn't be of any use if you stay.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,520
If you don't want to leave, you'll have to pay us every day.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,500
Right, that's the only way we'll let you stay.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,760
What? It's like this even in a game?

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:39,350
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

7
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,010
Episode 9 A Fairy's Power

8
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,260
Didn't Kamuy tell you that it'd be tough mentally?

9
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,420
I knew it'd be difficult before the goblin attack,

10
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,750
but I didn't expect it to be so relentless.

11
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,370
Relax, I found something good while you were training.

12
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,810
(GUARD COUNSELLING CENTER)
This is…

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
Guard training gathers together a lot of hotheads,

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,940
naturally all sorts of problems arise.

15
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,050
This is where they treat traumatized soldiers,

16
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,470
the guard counselling center, I think.

17
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,590
"You think"? So you don't even know for sure?

18
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,300
It's also my first time experiencing this game event.

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,490
But this is definitely the right place for you at this stage.

20
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,750
It's OK, I don't need this kind of thing.

21
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,900
You're being blackmailed.

22
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,270
That shouldn't happen, even in a game!

23
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,250
So, what's troubling you?

24
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,690
I recently became a guard,

25
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,690
and I'm having some interpersonal relationship problems.

26
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,970
Can you give more details?

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,870
The instructor isn't really trying to train me,

28
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,150
the other recruits look down on me.

29
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,420
Hiro, tell him about the blackmail.

30
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,890
And I'm being

31
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,690
blackmailed by other recruits.

32
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,690
Can you give any more details?

33
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,870
I see. I understand the situation.

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,440
Really? Then…

35
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,840
But, aren't you to blame for this as well?

36
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,840
According to your account,

37
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,740
all your problems were caused by your own lack of skill.

38
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,470
Yet you want to put up appearances and become a guard.

39
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,870
But, Tesla invited me.

40
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,800
Wouldn't it have been better to reject his offer?

41
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,250
That's, well…

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,000
I can only urge you

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
to withdraw from training as soon as possible.

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,050
You have many other options.

45
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,830
Alright, who's next?

46
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,830
W… Wait!

47
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,250
Who's next?

48
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,530
That was no help at all.

49
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,210
What's the point of that Guard Counselling Center?

50
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,900
Actually, it's the same in real life,

51
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,120
counselling doesn't seem to resolve anything.

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,590
Then why did you make me go?

53
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,530
But don't you feel a bit better after talking about your feelings?

54
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,520
Perhaps it'll help you from here on out.

55
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,770
Really? I hope so.

56
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,470
Hiro!

57
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,120
Cassie.

58
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,820
Hiro, are you not feeling well?

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,180
No, it's not that.

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,890
That's good. This place is for people who are sick or hurt.

61
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,620
It's not use talking to them about ordinary problems.

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
What?

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,370
This one…

64
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,350
If anything is troubling you, I'm sure there are a lot of solutions.

65
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,330
For example…

66
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,760
What is it?

67
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,170
If I fall on hard times, I pray to god,

68
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,570
and something good always happens.

69
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,060
Really?

70
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,670
It's best not to take these things too hard.

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,720
Keep moving forward at your own pace.

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
Right, thank you.

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,420
Are we really going to pray?

74
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,640
Cassie seems like a devout believer,

75
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,830
but I don't have any faith in these things.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,940
You idiot, that was an obvious flag,

77
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,550
hinting that there's a "pray to god" event.

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,670
Isn't this a set formula in games?

79
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,550
You're right.

80
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,870
I see, I completely understand.

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,350
Really? Then…

82
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,260
I can see some kind of dark aura surrounds you.

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,000
I will begin the purification rite.

84
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,240
Purification rite?

85
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,070
Maybe it's something like a baptism?

86
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,790
I see. Baptism?

87
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,970
I think I've heard of that.

88
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,270
What?

89
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,880
Is this a baptism? Did they mix it up with a penalty game?

90
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,350
Your body has been purified through a shower of holy water.

91
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,350
Everything will go well for you from now on.

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Thank you.

93
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,520
So cold.

94
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,680
This is great, Hiro.

95
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,910
Will everything change now?

96
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,700
It'll definitely change for the better!

97
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,990
I'm looking forward to tomorrow!

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,440
That's great…

99
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,500
That's unhygienic. You should cover your nose with your hand!

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,920
Sorry.

101
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,750
DAY FOUR

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,370
Nothing has changed at all!

103
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,250
What did the purification rite even do?

104
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,290
Strange, maybe we should have donated to charity instead?

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,070
You're really weak.

106
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,470
You should keep swinging your sword alone. Forever.

107
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,930
Damn it.

108
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,350
How pathetic.

109
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,820
Weakness is a sin, so get your money out.

110
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,750
We're here for our money, like we told you yesterday.

111
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,200
I don't have any.

112
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,580
Didn't we talk about this?

113
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,620
There's no way around it, we'll have to teach you a lesson.

114
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,080
Today I'll be your opponent.

115
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,600
Hiro, this guy seems pretty weak. Fight him.

116
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,500
Right.

117
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,240
If my opponent is this guy, not Granada…

118
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,300
Looks like there's some life in this guy, Paru.

119
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,950
Bring it on!

120
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,560
Then I won't hold back.

121
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,740
He's so fast!

122
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,490
What's wrong?

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,370
I lost.

124
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,550
I give up.

125
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,580
We're not done yet.

126
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,000
Stop, stop it!

127
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,790
Isn't he going too far?

128
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,370
This isn't good.

129
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,430
Here, quickly.

130
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,160
Hey, Paru.

131
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,260
What's wrong? What happened?

132
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,160
Nothing, we're just training.

133
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,240
Right, I was just training with Hiro.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,090
Really? Then that's fine.

135
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,250
But, isn't it obvious they're…

136
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Alright, everyone get back to training.

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,340
The situation hasn't changed at all.

138
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,160
I even went to counselling and got showered in holy water.

139
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,250
Hiro.

140
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,360
The one to solve this problem is you. Don't rely on others.

141
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,630
It was you who told me to go!

142
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,940
What are you whining about by yourself?

143
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,320
Have you started to lose it finally?

144
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,310
Cassie.

145
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,280
Hey, what's the relationship between you two?

146
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,160
We're friends.

147
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,620
Is that right? Friends?

148
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,250
Since you're friends,

149
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,970
then she'll receive the same treatment as you from now on.

150
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,620
How about that?

151
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,290
Hey, Cassie, are you and Hiro friends?

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,500
I…

153
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,220
Cassie, tell us.

154
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,660
I…

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm not Hiro's friend.

156
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,620
Well put, Cassie.

157
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,550
Seems like only you think you're friends.

158
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,620
Hiro, are you alright?

159
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,660
How could I be? Why were you laughing too?

160
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,090
The betrayal of a friend hurts more than being bullied.

161
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,350
You'll have to just accept it.

162
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,870
It's not Cassie's fault, anyone would have done the same.

163
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,380
Alright, don't take it too seriously, buck up.

164
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,070
This is only a game, it's not like you're being bullied in real life.

165
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,520
And there's only one day left before the goblin attack.

166
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,990
Another day? I'm already out of motivation.

167
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,380
Hiro, although I don't want to step outside my role here,

168
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,410
I have no choice. Looks like I'll have to step in.

169
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,420
Step in? What can you do?

170
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,390
Don't worry, I'm going to show you the fairy power.

171
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,380
DAY FIVE

172
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,640
Damn.

173
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,350
Damn it, where are my shoes?

174
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,230
G… Granada, did you maybe forget where you put them?

175
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,780
I put them here last night, but they were gone in the morning.

176
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,240
Even if you say so, we've been searching for a long time.

177
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,710
Don't you have another pair?

178
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,370
Put them on and we'll go look again, alright?

179
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,860
Damn it.

180
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,280
Aren't those Granada's shoes?

181
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,370
What?

182
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,520
Wow, how disgusting.

183
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,000
This is too much.

184
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,450
Damn it, what the hell happened?

185
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,870
Didn't your grandma make those shoes for you

186
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,730
when you decided to become a mercenary?

187
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,420
Who? Who did a pathetic thing like this?

188
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,240
Granada's shoes are soaked in sewage.

189
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,200
And this is only the prologue.

190
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,900
I can't find it, where's my sword?

191
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm sure I put it here.

192
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,230
Who did this? Damn it.

193
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,330
Him again?

194
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,100
He's so grumpy.

195
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,410
Huh? Who was laughing just now?

196
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,480
Let's all go look together.

197
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,050
Isn't it a big steel sword with dragon pattern on it?

198
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,590
Well, let's go outside and look for it.

199
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,950
How about that sewer?

200
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,940
It's like when everyone was looking for the shoes,

201
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,390
we couldn't find them anywhere.

202
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,580
Enough.

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,580
Let's look again tomorrow, I'm sure we'll find it.

204
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,260
I told you already, it's enough.

205
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,260
What? He's not going to even say thanks?

206
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,630
What the hell is going on?

207
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,200
What's wrong?

208
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,120
Isn't that…

209
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,900
This is terrible! The sword is stuck in shit!

210
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,500
Why?

211
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,480
Why?

212
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,940
Hiro, you did this!

213
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,700
It wasn't me!

214
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,340
In any case, can you wash your hands first?

215
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,470
It was you!

216
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,670
You hid my shoes and sword out of spite.

217
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,420
Stop, you don't have any proof. He didn't even have the time.

218
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,520
But this guy…

219
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,250
Don't take it out on Hiro,

220
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,640
he was also helping to look for your sword.

221
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,570
Ah!

222
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,730
What's wrong?

223
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,550
What happened, Maria?

224
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,440
My underwear is missing from the dressing room.

225
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,870
It's white and unblemished, just like me.

226
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,820
The buttocks are also embroidered with flowers.

227
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,240
What did you say?

228
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,660
What happened?

229
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,350
Is there a thief?

230
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,980
That's…

231
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,270
This is Granada's pack.

232
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,630
Huh?

233
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,830
That's them! The underwear I was looking for!

234
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,370
How awful, this man stole my underwear!

235
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,140
He must have stolen them to do something unspeakable.

236
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,950
Are you joking, old lady?

237
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,010
Who would want underwear from an ugly old woman like you?

238
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,420
How could you say that?

239
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,020
I've been lonely every night since my husband died.

240
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,000
I embroidered flowers just to make them a little fashionable,

241
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
what's wrong with that?

242
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,640
Right?

243
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,650
Granada, you should cut it out.

244
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,370
You've gone too far.

245
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,190
It's this old lady!

246
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,030
How dare you speak rudely to our nurse?

247
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,650
Right! This underwear thief.

248
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,450
I said it wasn't me!

249
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,660
Then why were they in your pack?

250
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,120
Right. You pervert.

251
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,520
I don't know!

252
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,500
Don't think because you're a little talented

253
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,320
you can act so big-headed.

254
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,420
It is important for guards to work as a team.

255
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,090
A guy like you will only cause us all trouble.

256
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,540
Stop being so big-headed, you just look like a goblin.

257
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,270
-Right!
-Goblin face!

258
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,780
Let's go, Paru.

259
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,350
Don't speak to me!

260
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,340
You shoe-less shit-sword goblin-faced bastard!

261
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,240
Let's go, senpais.

262
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,030
We might catch "goblin" off him.

263
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,380
Hey…

264
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,860
I just received news,

265
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,920
Granada seems to be resigning from his post

266
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,360
for personal reasons.

267
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,450
He dropped out?

268
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,170
He's so weak-willed, like most young people these days.

269
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,900
Then just get back to training or whatever, don't slack off.

270
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,120
Lord Tesla?

271
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,420
Sorry for interrupting everyone's training.

272
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,920
This was left on my desk.

273
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,250
What is it?

274
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,390
It says the man who stole Granada's shoes

275
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,270
and forced him to drop out

276
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,090
was you, Instructor Amos.

277
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,240
What?

278
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,940
What?

279
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,330
Why would I do something like that?

280
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,400
It's also written here that,

281
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,320
Instructor Amos lost to Granada in training a few days ago,

282
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,150
and he has been bearing a grudge against him ever since.

283
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,970
Is that right, Paru?

284
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,000
You wrote this, didn't you?

285
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,550
PARU

286
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,220
Paru, you…

287
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,600
I didn't write that! Someone must be playing a prank.

288
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,270
Don't lie! Everything you wrote was false too!

289
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,590
Amos, I don't know if what's written in this letter is true,

290
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,750
but I know your behavior has been improper for some time.

291
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,740
Didn't you show up late today, too?

292
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,600
I didn't, please let me explain.

293
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,250
I'm here to ask you

294
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,700
if Amos is worthy of being an instructor here.

295
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,720
Even if you put it like that…

296
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,220
You all…

297
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,890
He's not!

298
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,500
Cassie?

299
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,980
Granada and Paru have been bullying Hiro,

300
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,800
and Amos just turned a blind eye.

301
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,170
What are you talking about?

302
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,570
I was just following everyone else, they all hate Hiro.

303
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,940
Right, it's not only Instructor Amos.

304
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,950
Everyone… including me, have treated Hiro unfairly.

305
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,860
That's right.

306
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,730
We're all responsible.

307
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,750
We were really cold to him.

308
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,500
Well put, reflect on that and apologize to Hiro.

309
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,340
Shut up! You were the worst of all!

310
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,750
What? How dare you talk back to your instructor?

311
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,430
You just leave us to train by ourselves, you don't teach at all!

312
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,310
You must have been the one who drove Granada away.

313
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,400
That's right!

314
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,000
Confess already!

315
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,510
This was your doing!

316
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,420
Y… you…

317
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,740
Useless instructor!

318
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,080
How can you be so weak and so arrogant?

319
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,070
Lord Tesla,

320
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,610
they're all banding together to set me up!

321
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,720
There's no way to prove this accusation about Granada.

322
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,920
That means…

323
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,700
But none of these guards will stand by you.

324
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,890
That means you're not qualified to lead.

325
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,140
I'm temporarily relieving you of your post.

326
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,130
Everyone keep training until the new instructor arrives.

327
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,100
How could this happen?

328
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,450
Lord Tesla, wait, please!

329
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,000
Lord Tesla!

330
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,960
Hiro, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

331
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,640
It's alright.

332
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,480
We were all wrong.

333
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,810
Please forgive me.

334
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,200
Let's all work hard and train together.

335
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,380
Hey, look.

336
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,830
Mission complete!

337
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,160
That's "the power of a fairy"!

338
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,780
So it was all your doing.

339
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,610
Are you crying for joy?

340
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,280
You went too far! What "fairy power" was that?

341
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,200
It's an evil and spiteful power!

342
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,110
What are you talking about, Hiro?

343
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,690
What goes around comes around.

344
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,690
Even so, you still went too far.

345
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,250
That was the first time I've seen an adult cry like that.

346
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,470
Right, I should have put some more pressure on Paru.

347
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,920
Enough already, don't do any more dumb stuff like that!

348
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,200
Hiro, look at your title.

349
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,880
"Evil and Spiteful Best Friend Killer"

350
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,240
Why is all this being blamed on me?

351
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,560
Well, I'm just a supporting character after all.

352
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,110
This "Evil and Spiteful" title is

353
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,510
even worse than the "Best Best Friend Killer" one!

354
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,110
Don't take it too seriously, the goblin attack is tomorrow,

355
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,260
are you ready?

356
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm not ready, I haven't got stronger at all.

357
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,460
My console is definitely going to break tomorrow.

358
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,860
Then, do you want to give up?

359
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,110
I'm going to try my best, at least I got this far.

360
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,480
I still don't know if you're weak or strong, Hiro.

361
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,930
What does it matter?

362
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,520
But I can feel your resolve.
