1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,220
No!

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Stop it!

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,350
PANTS-WETTING BEST FRIEND KILLER

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,600
I'm done with it! Only a fool will play this shit game again!

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,870
I did not wet my pants in reality.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,250
Isn't this just like that time?

7
00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:01,320
Full Dive:
This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

8
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,930
Episode 4 The Only One to Beat the Game

9
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,680
Right after I entered high school, came the Athletics Games of the area.

10
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,360
That's Hiroshi Yuki!

11
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,030
He was a very good runner in junior high school.

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,470
It's said he's the most anticipated ace of the Athletics Department.

13
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,370
Go for it, brother!

14
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,530
Leave it to me!

15
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,870
Kaede, your brother is so handsome, isn't he?

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,710
Yeah, not bad.

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,680
I can't let them see me being humiliated!

18
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,410
Hiro!

19
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,280
It's about to start.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,410
Yeah!

21
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,520
What's up? You nervous?

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,830
Nonsense! It's just a regional competition.

23
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,160
Don't take it too lightly. It seems that Moriguchi will also be there.

24
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,810
Moriguchi… You mean Tatsuya Moriguchi?

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,000
He was always at the top of the list in junior high school, right?

26
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,470
I think he also won over you before.

27
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,310
And looks like some athletics scouts are here to watch the game today.

28
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,900
Scouts? It's just a regional competition!

29
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,180
It's the first competition since we entered high school.

30
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,750
People came from many schools and the Athletics Federation.

31
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,630
It's definitely an important competition.

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,210
Maybe. I have to go now.

33
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,940
Yeah.

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,740
Moriguchi?

35
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,780
Take it easy. Relax.

36
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,500
Go to the bathroom before it starts.

37
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,620
What? Where is it again?

38
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,810
Hey, are you Hiroshi Yuki?

39
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,870
Yeah, it's me.

40
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,400
Can I talk to you a little bit?

41
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,300
Is it you? That player, Mike McLachlan?

42
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,720
Aha, I've retired.

43
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,120
The Olympic silver medalists, Mike McLachlan, who loves Japan.

44
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,140
I heard that he's become a sports journalist now. Is it true? So cool!

45
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,520
Hiroshi Yuki, the ace of the Athletics Department in junior high school.

46
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,170
I heard you broke the record of the regional sprint race.

47
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,180
You knew about that?

48
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,870
With highly anticipated athletes as you and Moriguchi in this game,

49
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,350
everyone is expecting one of you two to be a rising athletics star.

50
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,300
Hiroshi, please do your best. I'm looking forward to it.

51
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,760
I will!

52
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,930
Why am I stuttering?

53
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,890
And I forgot to go to the bathroom!

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,490
Please get ready for the men's 100-meter race.

55
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,160
It's Tatsuya Moriguchi!

56
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,610
And Hiroshi Yuki! Awesome!

57
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,980
You look relaxed, Yuki.

58
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,070
Do you know the Olympic medal winner Mike is here?

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,940
Yeah.

60
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,550
You knew that, and still this attitude?

61
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,200
I just have to perform as usual.

62
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,440
As long as I have good results here,

63
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,700
I will get Mike's attention and be in his report.

64
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,950
I will never lose.

65
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,870
Me neither.

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,190
On your marks!

67
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,220
Everyone is watching, even the scouts are here.

68
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,050
I have to win, beat Moriguchi and make the best run.

69
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,020
Get set!

70
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,140
Yuki, run in less than 6 seconds!

71
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,540
What nonsense? That would break the world record.

72
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,290
What am I doing?

73
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,950
Damn it! Come on! Damn it! Damn it!

74
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,200
I can make it!

75
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,770
Yuki fell down!

76
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,680
Really?

77
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,500
Hiro!

78
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,370
Are you all right?

79
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm OK, O…

80
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,480
Really?

81
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,010
Did he wet his pants?

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,180
So gross!

83
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,120
He was not the first in the race, but the first to pee.

84
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,240
Hiro!

85
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,500
Anyway, go to the bathroom first.

86
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,040
I'd rather die!

87
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,740
About that, don't take it too seriously.

88
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,570
Everyone fails.

89
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,690
Leave me alone!

90
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,870
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

91
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,240
Really, don't care too much. Just go for it next time.

92
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,810
Don't pester me!

93
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,240
There's no "next time"!

94
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,250
Mr. Mike.

95
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,060
That's terrible.

96
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,430
No. That's not my usual performance.

97
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,390
Not at my best. I can usually run better.

98
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,300
Looks like you really know nothing.

99
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,060
Did you wet your pants on purpose?

100
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,810
How is that possible?

101
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,720
So you just did that because you were too nervous?

102
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,510
Then I wish you'd wet your pants on purpose.

103
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,250
Why?

104
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,710
The mentality of athletes is critical.

105
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,750
If you can't perform as usual because of nervousness, that's really bad!

106
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,460
But, Hiro, you've made a more serious mistake.

107
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,470
What do you mean?

108
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,120
Don't you understand?

109
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,400
Here is a Japanese proverb I just learned.

110
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,630
Wash your underwear before you come back.

111
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,750
There is no such proverb.

112
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,470
What do you want?

113
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,370
You screamed again last night, right? Full dive RPG again?

114
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,920
It was not in the middle of the night.

115
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,120
That doesn't mean you can make so much noise, does it?

116
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,990
I couldn't concentrate on my study!

117
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,860
Don't you also argue with your friends loudly?

118
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,500
So what?

119
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,040
Calm down a little bit, both of you.

120
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,570
But he shouted like a werewolf in the middle of the night!

121
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,530
Don't call your brother that fictional creature.

122
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,690
You sounded even worse than a werewolf! More disgusting!

123
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,120
Like this, and this.

124
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,480
I won't shout again. I have quit playing that game.

125
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,970
You've quit? What is that?

126
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,320
It's an incredibly shit game. I'm going to sell it.

127
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,370
You don't even know how to make excuses!

128
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,250
Anyway, it must be too hard to win, right?

129
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,380
It's nothing like that!

130
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,500
You suck. You're just a terrible player.

131
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,440
What are you talking about? Didn't you tell me to stop playing?

132
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,110
It's not the same thing!

133
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,510
You became addicted to the full dive RPG after the athletics setback.

134
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,890
Yet now you've even given up on the full dive RPG!

135
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,230
Anyway, you are terrible!

136
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,740
You are saying that again!

137
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,850
I have to go now.

138
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,290
Watch out for traffic!

139
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,670
Damn it! What's wrong with her?

140
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,880
She wants you to always be the handsome brother in her mind.

141
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,720
What is the meaning of that?

142
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,230
She always shows off you to her classmates.

143
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,710
That was a long time ago.

144
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,530
Hiro!

145
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,240
Actually, we have something to trouble you with, is it okay?

146
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,330
Will that do?

147
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,100
What happened?

148
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,250
Why is he so nice?

149
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,800
Hiro, you're OK with that?

150
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,360
It's OK. Just leave me alone.

151
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,120
Hey, Yuki! About the results of the last volunteer interview, it's time…

152
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,690
I'm still thinking about it. Please wait a little longer.

153
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,520
Wait a little longer? For how many days?

154
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,120
Hi.

155
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,390
Hiro, what happened to you?

156
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,080
I've called you seven times today.

157
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,370
Sorry, I was at school.

158
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,040
Do you want to come to our store now? I have something to show you.

159
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,860
I see. Actually, I'd like to come over and take a look.

160
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,620
Stay as long as you like. It's closed for the day.

161
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,390
The thing I just said I wanted to show you is…

162
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,130
Please take this first.

163
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,220
Wow, it's Kiwame Quest.

164
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,820
I want to sell it.

165
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,500
Again?

166
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm not kidding.

167
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,530
Stop it. Stop it.

168
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,480
I'm serious.

169
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,750
Why? Can you tell me the reason?

170
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,390
The reason? Don't you know?

171
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,210
But it's so hard to reach the climax.

172
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,370
Reach the climax? What are you talking about?

173
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,050
I became a murderer, was haunted by a ghost,

174
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,210
and ended up wetting my pants. What kind of…

175
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,790
Sorry. Is it the "Pants-Wetting Best Friend Killer"?

176
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,510
It's the first time I've seen that title.

177
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,170
It's my first time, too!

178
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,250
Don't be so angry!

179
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,770
Did you see that? The Heretic Inquisitor was was very happy, right?

180
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,700
What's the use of raising her favorability?

181
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,670
Maybe you can make her your companion?

182
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,650
I don't want that kind of companion!

183
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,620
Never mind. I'll sell it to another store.

184
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,770
If you want money, you better forget it.

185
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,270
What do you mean?

186
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,460
You don't know that? When selling a used car with 200,000 km,

187
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,550
the buyer will ask you for disposal fees instead.

188
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,510
Then why did you sell me this game at the original price?

189
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,160
Sorry, I can't tell you exactly why yet. But…

190
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,640
Have you heard of Soichiro Kamui?

191
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,110
Never.

192
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,120
He is a young congressman with a promising future.

193
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,620
He used to be an amazing player of full dive RPG.

194
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,830
This is really embarrassing to say.

195
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,290
I really enjoyed playing full dive RPGs in high school.

196
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,050
There was one game that changed my life significantly.

197
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,120
That's quite a surprise! May I ask what kind of game that was?

198
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,370
A super orthodox full dive RPG pursuing the ultimate sense of realism.

199
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,780
Soichiro Kamui. His player name in Kiwame Quest is Kamuy.

200
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,190
That's…

201
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,460
My name is Kamuy.

202
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,790
My title is "Forever Invincible Adventurer".

203
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,340
The one who beats the game Kiwame Quest.

204
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,290
Right! Kamui is the only one who beats this shit game… Kiwame Quest.

205
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,660
What did you just say?

206
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,150
I said Kamui was the only one in the spotlight for beating Kiwame Quest.

207
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,660
No, you just said "shit game", right?

208
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,690
Anyway, I really want you to beat this game on your own.

209
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,030
But it's better than if you completely lose interest.

210
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,130
Strain your eyes to look at this.

211
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,000
I remember it should be "strain my ear"…

212
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,440
The journey of Oberdine?

213
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,890
This is the walkthrough website Kamuy made in his high school days.

214
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,860
Really?

215
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,070
Aren't you interested now?

216
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,390
No. What's interesting about it?

217
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,270
You want to know the content? Right?

218
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,150
So, please.

219
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
Click on that "Enter".

220
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,800
Yeah, OK.

221
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,410
This effect is so poorly designed!

222
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,700
But, with this site already in place, why hasn't anyone else beaten it?

223
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,100
Right. Because

224
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,750
Hardly anyone could read it.

225
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,720
Is it because he wrote it in an obscure way?

226
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,390
A text site? It is really old-fashioned in this era.

227
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,940
Hey, scum!

228
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,640
Hey, scum!

229
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,240
Those scums who can't beat it without walkthroughs, better die already!

230
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,990
No, you might as well just kill yourself, right now!

231
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,840
You can hardly read it, right?

232
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,890
That's what you mean!

233
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,490
Kamuy was also an arrogant brat back then.

234
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,970
Just bear with it and keep reading.

235
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,340
I don't want to put up with this!

236
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,630
Hey, you! You don't think this guide is free, do you?

237
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,440
Pay for it!

238
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,690
What? You don't have money? You poor bastard!

239
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,270
Worship me from now on!

240
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,590
Just sit tight and listen to me with gratitude, you piece of shit!

241
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,090
So pissed off!

242
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,240
Unlike me, a talent in literature and martial arts, you are mediocre.

243
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,270
Start with exercise!

244
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,510
Every day, do 500 push-ups and sit-ups, 3 groups for each,

245
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,590
run 5 km. Buy dumbbells and go to the gym.

246
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,820
Who will do that?

247
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,940
Even if the physical strength in reality will be reflected in the game,

248
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,530
this is not the information that should be written on this site.

249
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,190
What's your case now, scum?

250
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,640
A GUY WHO WANTS TO BEAT GOBLINS.
A GUY WHO WANTS TO DATE HIS/HER CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART.
A GUY WHOSE LIFE IS BEING THREATENED BY HIS/HER CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART.
A FOOL WHO IS TROUBLED BY THE SOUL OF A DECEASED GOOD FRIEND.
AN IDIOT WHO WANTS TO GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.

251
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,390
A guy whose life is being threatened by his/her childhood sweetheart.

252
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,400
That's it!

253
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,850
Hey, psycho!

254
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,030
Normally no one would be targeted by his/her childhood sweetheart.

255
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,090
That means you are the scum of the scum.

256
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,450
What kind of life have you spent to become like that?

257
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,220
My heart hurts!

258
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,950
Listen up, the childhood sweetheart entitled "Fruit Cutter from Hell",

259
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,440
will have all her abilities increased by a dozen times.

260
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,160
Without the combat experience like mine, it is impossible to handle.

261
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,160
Give up your resistance and let her kill you.

262
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,920
What the heck? It's not a guide at all!

263
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,890
As much as I'd like to say that, I'll tell you,

264
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,940
since you can't win head-on, use your mind

265
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,960
and come up with a way to win without fighting.

266
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,930
Simply put, if you were the girl who was a childhood friend,

267
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,410
how would you least like to be treated?

268
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,940
That's all the advice I can give, you piece of shit.

269
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,110
How was that? Was that helpful?

270
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,560
No, not at all.

271
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,500
Wait, there is an item field.

272
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,880
"A fool who is troubled by the soul of a deceased good friend."

273
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,330
That's it! No. Who are you calling a fool?

274
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,660
What is there to be afraid of a ghost, coward?

275
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,130
Besides, it's because you killed someone! Just take the consequences.

276
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,660
Take him on an adventure with you. That's it. Go to hell!

277
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,950
Not helpful at all!

278
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,940
What about this one?

279
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,340
A GUY WITHOUT A WEAPON FROM THE BEGINNING.

280
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,160
Weapons… I don't have.

281
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,350
What are you doing?

282
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,450
I don't need weapons because I'm strong enough. Is that what you think?

283
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,840
Do you think you are a martial arts master? Idiot!

284
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,570
Isn't the sword in the corner of the original room, you bald shit!

285
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,470
I'm not bald!

286
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,090
So there is a sword in that room.

287
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,420
I ran out in such a hurry that I didn't notice.

288
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,340
Prepare all the items.

289
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,290
A fool like you must think you can buy in the item store at any time.

290
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,970
But the items will be sold out too!

291
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,090
Collect them all before it's too late. Got it, idiot?

292
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,990
You might as well die for once, idiot.

293
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
Idiot, idiot… So annoying!

294
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,020
Besides, there are times when the item store is out of stock?

295
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,940
What… What…

296
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,590
Isn't that good, Hiro?

297
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,340
In this way, you can continue to play Kiwame Quest.

298
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,350
I haven't decided to continue or not…

299
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,280
If someone can beat this game after Kamui,

300
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,140
I want to marry him.

301
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,460
I want to marry him. No, I will marry him.

302
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,030
In other words, it's a relationship for the purpose of marriage.

303
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,160
Hiro, you seem to be quite to my liking.

304
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,650
Like me?

305
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,700
No, wait!

306
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,050
I won't be fooled by your sweet words.

307
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,180
Really? You don't want to hang out with people like me, Hiro?

308
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,700
If you say so…

309
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,770
Let's hang out… together, shall we?

310
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,860
So you'd better go back online soon, OK?

311
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,580
So, I still have to start from here, right?

312
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,030
Hey, it's time to meet Tesla, the captain of the City Guard.

313
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,750
Keep up, but don't get too close.

314
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,450
Hiro!

315
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,970
If it's convenient for you, let's do it all over again later, OK?

316
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,310
No way!

317
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,770
Then I'll take this sheet back.

318
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,180
What are you doing?

319
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,150
I'm going to take this with me.

320
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,700
So that I can feel the warmth of "Mr. Wetting Pants" all the time.

321
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,700
Can you stop calling me that!

322
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,570
All right, ignore her. Let's get going.

323
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,550
But, but…

324
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,420
Enough. Come on!

325
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,040
I've wasted a lot of time convincing you.

326
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,140
Hey, "wasted"?

327
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,760
Don't dilly-dally!

328
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,450
Gosh! So annoying!

329
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,820
I said keep up quickly!

330
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,130
I'm sure we will meet again, Mr. Wetting Pants!

331
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,830
Stop calling me that!

332
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,450
I didn't expect that I would play this game again.

333
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,100
Indeed, as Kamuy said, maybe I'm "an idiot better off dead".
