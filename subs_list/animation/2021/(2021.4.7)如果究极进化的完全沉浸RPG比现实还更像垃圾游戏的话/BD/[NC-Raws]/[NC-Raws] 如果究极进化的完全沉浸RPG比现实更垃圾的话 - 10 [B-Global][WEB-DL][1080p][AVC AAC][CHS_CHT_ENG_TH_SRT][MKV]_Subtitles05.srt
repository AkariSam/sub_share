1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,330
To match your conviction, I will tell you the truth.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,320
Reona?

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,650
If someone other than Kamuy is able to complete the game,

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,640
then I'll marry him.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,010
I said that before, right?

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,670
Right, but wasn't that a joke?

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,170
Actually, I met Kamuy ten years ago.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,200
But I met him only in the game.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,250
He was striding through Ted City, dressed in black armor.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,390
For a high school student like me,

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,180
his poise was what I'd always dreamed of.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,710
So when he decided to leave Ted City,

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,890
I finally confessed to him.

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,150
I asked him to go out with me, and he said…

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm not into girls with breasts as big as cow udders.

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,810
Everything has its limit.

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,040
You're over the limit, bye-bye.

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,790
How dare he to say that!

19
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,150
What the hell does he mean, "over the limit"?

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,930
My chest isn't a credit card!

21
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,090
After that he beat this insanely difficult Kiwame Quest,

22
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,400
so I decided to get revenge on him,

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,010
and make the next person to complete the game

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,170
my husband.

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,900
Are you finished?

26
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,230
Right! So finish Kiwame Quest, Hiro!

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,820
Then marry me and after our honeymoon,

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,260
we can kiss in front of Kamui while giving him the finger.

29
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:27,280
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

30
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,930
Episode 10 A New Ally

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,970
I really shouldn't listen to her.

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,860
Usually if someone hides something this long,

33
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,370
there's usually a more thrilling, deeper motive, right?

34
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,740
This one isn't thrilling at all.

35
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,940
Instead, my motivation has taken a hit.

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,780
Hiro, you're still awake?

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,610
Tesla.

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,180
I'm very sorry about Granada and Amos.

39
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,620
It's fine, it's over now.

40
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,210
It's been late, what are you doing here, anyway?

41
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,070
We don't know when Goblin will attack.

42
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,100
I can't relax, thinking about that.

43
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,930
Tonight should be fine.

44
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,690
That's just what I think.

45
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,990
I can't tell him "that's what's written on the strategy website".

46
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,020
You're an incredible man.

47
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,560
Hiro.

48
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,180
Do you want to leave this city?

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,830
No, that's…

50
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,020
I understand, if I weren't the guard captain I'd want to too.

51
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,800
Try my luck out there in the big world.

52
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,410
Tesla.

53
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,100
Then, leave with me!

54
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,800
Right.

55
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,620
If weI can overcome this crisis,

56
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,310
it'd be nice to go on a journey with you.

57
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,110
Really?

58
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,170
I'll think about it.

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,140
We have to get rid of Goblin first, though.

60
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,060
That sounded like a death flag.

61
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,370
I don't want Tesla die.

62
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,870
Maybe I should look at the strategy website.

63
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,370
Kaede, what are you doing in my room?

64
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,930
You weren't trying to kill me while I played

65
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,930
by covering my nose and mouth, were you?

66
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,670
Of course not!

67
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,810
You weren't responding, no matter how much I knocked,

68
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,950
so I thought you might have died!

69
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,570
I see, so, why did you come to my room?

70
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,250
That time…

71
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,000
This is the only thing I don't want to give up on halfway,

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,250
please let me play.

73
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,560
You looked ready to do a double suicide with your RPG.

74
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,190
I was a teeny-tiny bit concerned.

75
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,770
You were worried about me?

76
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,420
No!

77
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,560
If you died playing a game it'd really embarrass our family.

78
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,820
Thank you.

79
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,750
That's dangerous, what are you doing?

80
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,420
Whatever, of course a rotten nerd like you

81
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,920
would die alone playing a full dive game.

82
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,050
What do you mean "die playing a full dive game"?

83
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,500
What kind of little sister is she?

84
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,860
I think Kamuy said he'd teach me a Kiwame Quest trick.

85
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,510
You really survived the mercenary event, huh?

86
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,180
If you're lying, watch out your balls don't get stabbed by me.

87
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,540
Doesn't he mean stab? That's freaky!

88
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,680
If you're not lying, type in your current title.

89
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,870
EVIL AND SPITEFUL BEST FRIEND KILLER

90
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,660
You even got the "Evil and Spiteful Best Friend Killer" title?

91
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,580
That's good.

92
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,440
That's good? Was that a legitimate strategy?

93
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,540
Of course, there were other methods,

94
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,500
but it's better to be spiteful than to be bullied.

95
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,750
Then, let me teach you a little Kiwame Quest trick.

96
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,680
TRICK

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,660
Trick.

98
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,690
This is…

99
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,060
Are you still reading?

100
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,060
Gross. I've taught you everything I can.

101
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,240
Don't count on the strategy guide for everything,

102
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,100
you mindless puppet.

103
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,770
Why am I being scolded for reading a strategy guide?

104
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,750
Die, jackass.

105
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,500
And the website closed itself.

106
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,180
But I have to do it.

107
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,250
DAY SIX
DAY OF Goblin ATTACK

108
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,600
Goblins are finally going to attack.

109
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,110
-Hiro, have you polished your sword?
-Yes.

110
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,580
Have you eaten?

111
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,270
I'm 80% full.

112
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,850
-Did you pee?
-I did.

113
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,270
-Did you poop?
-I did.

114
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,870
Alright, then you're prepared for anything.

115
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,580
Although I don't see how I'm prepared for anything,

116
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,110
if I get through this, whatever happens next will be OK.

117
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,860
I have an announcement for you all today.

118
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,900
The danger of Goblin attack is building,

119
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,370
we have another two recruits joining us.

120
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,570
Granada's replacement?

121
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,910
It's nice to have more of us, even though it's only two.

122
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,290
They are Heretic Inquisitor Mizarisa,

123
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,540
and the Fruit Cutter from Hell, Alicia.

124
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,400
I hope you'll all get along.

125
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,480
How could we get along!

126
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,830
Now Goblins aren't my only enemies.

127
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,250
Hiro, long time no see!

128
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,500
Are you peeing yourself with excitement today?

129
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,870
Who would pee themselves with excitement? I'm not a baby!

130
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,870
Nice to meet everyone.

131
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,720
Female friends turned companions in a time of crisis,

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,750
it's a typical plot in games for boys.

133
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,670
You're in a harem! Isn't that great, Hiro?

134
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,900
It's not good at all!

135
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,210
Maybe I'll be cut up by a fruit knife and saw

136
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,980
before Goblin battle even begins!

137
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,510
Citizens from the outskirts are taking refuge in the city center,

138
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,220
but many have ignored our advice to do so.

139
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,250
It seems the situation has taken a turn for the worse

140
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,490
in the areas we haven't been able to cover.

141
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,770
Given this, I want to send you out on patrol.

142
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,760
Yes, sir!

143
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,970
Isn't today the day of Goblin attack?

144
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,920
It seems like there's another event before that.

145
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,250
But I'm sure it's not a hard mission.

146
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,980
I hope so.

147
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,840
Hiro, please go and patrol in the eastern quarter of the city.

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,960
The eastern quarter?

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,620
Where Mr. Ginji's place is.

150
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,630
Is there a problem?

151
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,050
No, no problem.

152
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,740
Then take Mizarisa and Alicia and head out.

153
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,250
Now that is a big problem!

154
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,510
I'm very happy to be with Hiro.

155
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,550
Good, you two get along well.

156
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,000
I figured when I saw you wave to each other.

157
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,000
I didn't wave! And…

158
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,890
And you know about that too, right?

159
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,780
Alicia hates me.

160
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,100
Isn't this a good opportunity to clear the air between you two?

161
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,910
We'll be fighting Goblins soon,

162
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,320
we can't have any bad blood between comrades.

163
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,970
Even so…

164
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,700
I'll leave this to you, Hiro.

165
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,300
Te…tesla.

166
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,330
Hiro, is it alright?

167
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,550
Is what alright?

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,820
Even though I restrained myself just now,

169
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,410
I still have to pay her back for what she did.

170
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,790
She almost killed you too.

171
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,920
Most importantly, that girl is dangerous.

172
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,070
You're dangerous enough yourself.

173
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,490
You should keep your distance from her.

174
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,500
Can you also keep your distance from me?

175
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,200
You're so mean!

176
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,000
Forget about Alicia. Mizarisa doesn't want to kill you.

177
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,300
Even if she doesn't want to kill me, she wants to torture me.

178
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,650
And why would there be trouble in the city

179
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,260
right before Goblin attack?

180
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,420
You idiot, law and order breaks down

181
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,110
during desperate times like this.

182
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,070
That kind of realism is really unnecessary in an RPG.

183
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,770
No, perhaps it's the reverse,

184
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,000
maybe it's because people are in panic

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,530
that the world becomes so chaotic.

186
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,440
Alright, we don't need that kind of philosophical talk.

187
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,440
Catch that thief!

188
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,920
Someone!

189
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,250
Out of my way!

190
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,800
No way! That was a move worthy of Alicia!

191
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,050
It's bloody!

192
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,360
Isn't it great, Hiro! Go and return the bag now!

193
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,320
B… but, there's still a hand attached to it.

194
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,400
It's like a free gift.

195
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,600
Where has free gifts like that?

196
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,440
You're helping the townspeople, it's a regular RPG plot,

197
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,320
you'll definitely get some kind of reward.

198
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,670
May… maybe.

199
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,020
U… uh, please take this.

200
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,070
Of course that happened!

201
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,050
You didn't get anything.

202
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,100
Why would you do a thing like that?

203
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,270
I'll be killed by Goblins anyway.

204
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,100
So you want to fulfil all your desires before then, is that right?

205
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,250
So you're just adding more kindling to the fire,

206
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,200
When there are so many who still want to live,

207
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,960
and so many who died too young?

208
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,390
Right, Hiro?

209
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,870
She's definitely talking about Martin!

210
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,860
Don't kill me, someone incited me to do it!

211
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,710
What?

212
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,100
He told me now was a good opportunity,

213
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,500
while the guard were distracted by Goblins.

214
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,000
-Thieves!
-Someone!

215
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,910
-Help!
-Wait!

216
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,610
Reona, this is…

217
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,020
It seems that someone is inciting people to do bad things.

218
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,870
It must be the boss behind this event.

219
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,580
Boss? Maybe we can get some weapons to fight Goblins.

220
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,530
Where's the guy you were talking about?

221
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,700
He's in that casino.

222
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,730
They captured a lot of people.

223
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,230
How scary.

224
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,770
Hiro, he's definitely the boss.

225
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,740
He looks really strong.

226
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,110
I'll handle it.

227
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,830
After all, you can't do anything but piss your pants.

228
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,910
Shut up!

229
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,300
Hiro, you go and rescue the people who are being held.

230
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,540
Got it.

231
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,720
You, come with me.

232
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm the Heretic…

233
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,590
I'm Mizarisa of the town guard.

234
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,970
Give up now and surrender.

235
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,190
The town guard?

236
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,970
Interesting.

237
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,240
Watch how we deal with you.

238
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,880
Want to fight? Great.

239
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,840
OK, now.

240
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,440
Everything is alright now.

241
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,510
Mr. Ginji?

242
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,370
You again?

243
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,280
You were captured too, Mr. Ginji?

244
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,450
Yes, they plan on selling me.

245
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,900
Really? Who would want to buy this old guy?

246
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,010
That was too easy.

247
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,740
Mr. Ginji, this isn't what we agreed!

248
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,960
Hiro!

249
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,150
Don't move! If anyone does, I'll wring his neck.

250
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,080
Hiro!

251
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,770
Could it be you, Mr. Ginji, who was behind all this?

252
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm behind all this? I can't pretend I didn't hear that.

253
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,210
This place has been a mess since Goblin attack.

254
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,260
I only helped to make things worse.

255
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,600
Why would you do that?

256
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,910
To distract the guards, of course.

257
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,350
I took advantage of this chance to make a lot of money.

258
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,670
You infiltrated the NPCs to become thieves?

259
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,250
Up until today.

260
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,690
Leave anything of value and get out,

261
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,720
or I'll kill this little brat.

262
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,470
Mr. Ginji, you're a really cool villain.

263
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,960
You bastard.

264
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,680
After all that happened, I thought we'd get along better.

265
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,490
Idiot, this isn't a teen drama.

266
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,220
How could we get along better after a fight?

267
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,380
We only know each other in this game, after all.

268
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,670
Really? Is it like that?

269
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,230
It seems that we will never understand each other.

270
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,150
I get it.

271
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,480
You smelly, old man.

272
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,100
You little bastard!

273
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,070
Hiro, you're awesome!

274
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,020
You're really strong when you're fighting Ginji!

275
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,880
Leave the rest to me.

276
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,240
Wait, Mizarisa.

277
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,270
Hiro?

278
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,450
Don't step in, let me handle this guy.

279
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,020
You'll handle me? You're so arrogant.

280
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,630
It's happening again! Battle with your opponent's karma!

281
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,460
I should tell you first, today's a little different.

282
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,940
I brought a more formidable weapon this time.

283
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,920
It must be a magic weapon.

284
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,790
Double knuckledusters!

285
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,600
You're as good as dead.

286
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,220
Isn't that just like last time? Are you stupid?

287
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,390
Idiot, my fighting power has doubled!

288
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,180
Die!

289
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,660
I'm not going to lose!

290
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,390
A fight between two weaklings, good luck to both of you!

291
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,840
Can this farce stop here?

292
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,000
Farce? A NPC is calling this a farce?

293
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,250
I'm sorry! Please spare me.

294
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,480
What a coward.

295
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,710
Here, line up.

296
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,710
It seems like the event is over.

297
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,840
Yeah.

298
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,850
Your childhood sweetheart is really impressive.

299
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,770
A gout-sufferer like me couldn't stop her.

300
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,000
But didn't you kill both your childhood friend and sweetheart?

301
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,040
That was long ago.

302
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,530
And at that time,

303
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,040
my childhood sweetheart hadn't become

304
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,140
the Fruit Cutter from Hell.

305
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,230
That sound makes me uncomfortable whenever I hear it.

306
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,050
Is that what happens to people when you lock them up?

307
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,550
You're very calm.

308
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,170
I'm alright.

309
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,150
What do you have to brag about now?

310
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,220
I have food to eat and I'm protected from Goblins.

311
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,290
It's all about how you look at it, jail life isn't necessarily bad.

312
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,680
I see, that's positive thinking.

313
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,820
Does that count as positive thinking?

314
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,160
That's how I got through real life too.

315
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,410
So you deliberately committed a crime to get put in jail?

316
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,200
He really is scum.

317
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,600
That's life wisdom.

318
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,240
What kind of life wisdom is that?

319
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,090
Let's go, no dawdling.

320
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,850
You should really change your way of life.

321
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't change that easily.

322
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,540
Hiro, good work catching that gang of thieves.

323
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,180
No, I didn't do anything.

324
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,470
Mizarisa and Alicia deserve all the…

325
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,280
Goblins are here!

326
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,930
Have they finally come?

327
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,970
Hiro, it's starting.

328
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,410
Alright.

329
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,590
-The enemy is by the North Gate!
-How did this happen?

330
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,630
-Let's go!
-Yes!

331
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,270
My stomach really hurts.

332
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,730
Didn't I tell you to go to the bathroom?

333
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,010
I did, but…

334
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,010
I know, you must be too nervous.

335
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,570
Think about it, don't you often need the toilet on exam days?

336
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,840
That's happened to you, right?

337
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Yes, but this is a game!

338
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,610
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

339
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,000
Kiwame Quest is a game that pursues absolute realism.

340
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,170
Things that happen in real life also happen in the game.

341
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,820
Anyway, go to the toilet quickly.

342
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,220
Damn, hurry up and come out!

343
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,430
Everyone is fighting Goblins, what I am fighting?

344
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,790
Alright, all better now.

345
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,570
I need to join Tesla now.

346
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,550
There's a Goblin peeping on me!

347
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,950
Episode 11 Entering a Dead-end Town
