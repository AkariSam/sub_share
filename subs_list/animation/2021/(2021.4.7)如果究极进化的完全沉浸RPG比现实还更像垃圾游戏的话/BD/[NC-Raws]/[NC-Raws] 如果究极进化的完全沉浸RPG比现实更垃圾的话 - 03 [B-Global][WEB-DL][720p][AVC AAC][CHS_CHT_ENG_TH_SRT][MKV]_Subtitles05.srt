1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,160
What should I do now?

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,500
Do you want me to help you?

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,450
Why, you want to be my partner?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,770
So how are you going to help me?

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,400
You'll see.

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,990
Best Friend Killer is here! Call the town guards!

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,920
Mr. Ginji?

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,280
Try to get through the interrogation of the town guard.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,420
If you're lucky, you might get acquitted.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,620
How come...

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,320
Where is the wanted man?

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,060
You must be Hiro. You're under arrest for killing Martin.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,290
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

14
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,990
Episode 3 Adult Activity

15
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,120
The guards are here so soon?

16
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,020
How can it be so fast in reality?

17
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,710
A place shows attributes of game only when it can gain benefits.

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,120
Look, this is your arrest warrant.
SUSPECT: HIRO ACCUSATION: KILLED MARTIN
CRIMINAL PROFILE OF THE SUSPECT IS RECORDED IN THE ATTACHED ARREST WARRANT.
PLACE OF DETENTION TEDO DETENTION CENTER

19
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,470
Wait, wait...

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,620
It hurts. I get the gout. Don't make me do this kind of work.

21
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,050
S-stop...

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,020
Are you a rooster?

23
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,770
You get the gout? Is that really so?

24
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,340
Besides, why should I duel with an uncle in the game?

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,360
Thank you for your cooperation.

26
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,930
My Lord, if I may...

27
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,930
You! Here you are.

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,090
Thank you.

29
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,060
What are you talking about, you scum!

30
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,400
Shut up, kid. Come on.

31
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,020
No matter what, you can't say "I killed someone".

32
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,420
If you don't want to be sentenced like me.

33
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,550
Sentenced? What do you mean?

34
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,650
I was sentenced to 13 years in jail. Now I'm released on bail.

35
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,770
No! How long did you stay there?

36
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,650
Do I have to start from prison every time I get online?

37
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,870
I would just stop playing this game!

38
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,080
You just can't stop.

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,030
Yeah? Henrique Mary.

40
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,250
It's crazy.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,330
You're crazy! Get moving now!

42
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,030
Ouch!

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,580
I said no violence...

44
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,270
Shut it.

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,250
I heard he is a murderer.

46
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,070
What a nuisance!

47
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,070
Look at the expression in his eyes.

48
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,440
He's worse than a beast.

49
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,920
Damn! Why not just omit this part?

50
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,810
Too much work in this boring part.

51
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,540
OK, that's about it.

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,600
It hurts. Damn! Who is it!

53
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,170
Ouch! What!

54
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,470
You bastard! Scum! Murderer!

55
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,440
What... Stop it. It hurts!

56
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,020
What's going on?

57
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,380
Time for the specialty of Tedo. Stone throwing.

58
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't want this specialty!

59
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,730
It's stone torture. Don't just stop here!

60
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,820
-Shut up, bastard. Killer, try my pumpkin bomb!
-It's killing me. Stop it!

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,750
I don't want this to happen. After all, it will affect me.

62
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,510
Ouch!

63
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,770
All right, that's it. It's over!

64
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,040
Hey! Stop it. Put the pumpkin down!

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,800
It's so boring.

66
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,510
It's over.

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,050
When is the next time?

68
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,740
I have to strengthen my shoulders.

69
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,240
Damn, it's too miserable. Why on earth I'm in this world?

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,850
Brave, defeat the demon, save the world, save Oberdine!

71
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,390
Wait, wait!

72
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,220
What? Anything else to complain?

73
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,360
Let me go now, or you'll regret it.

74
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,430
W-what do you mean?

75
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,240
Maybe you don't believe it, but I'm the brave.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,200
The king or someone else would come and ask me to save the world.

77
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,920
Then the special force of the brave in me will be awakened.
And I'll fulfill the hope of the whole village…

78
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,010
You, too?

79
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,720
What?

80
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,420
Recently, there are a lot of neurotics who claim to be the brave like you.

81
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,350
I've had enough!

82
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,240
It's not like that.

83
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,360
You're trying to get away with it by playing the fool? It's not that easy.

84
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,720
You guys got our blood pressure high!

85
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,320
So the Dragon Proud Sky setting for the brave is deleted?

86
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,820
I don't want that sense of reality!

87
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,450
Come on, let's go. I'm already working overtime.

88
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,060
I've long wanted to have a good rest at home.

89
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,540
OK, I'm sorry.

90
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll go. OK.

91
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,360
Alicia.

92
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,800
Eyes! My eyes.

93
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,360
Hiro, I will definitely find you and kill you wherever you are!

94
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,870
Hurry up and take me to the detention house or anywhere!

95
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,830
What's the matter? Don't rush me. I'll do that.

96
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,050
We're going to prepare you for the trial.

97
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,570
If you want to escape. Just try and see if you can succeed.

98
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,940
You murderer!

99
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,040
Ouch! Damn. You psychopathic guard!

100
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,750
So painful and hard.

101
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,380
That's enough. I'll get offline now.

102
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,980
Miss Reona said that she would come, but she didn't show up.

103
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,870
YOU'RE ACTIVE NOW. CAN'T GET OFFLINE.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER

104
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,290
What? Why is that? I'm not surfing the internet!

105
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,270
I think it's been an hour.

106
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,910
I don't think the activity will end in 30 minutes, so I have been waiting.

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,890
I'm sure this time is fine.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,600
YOU'RE ACTIVE NOW. CAN'T GET OFFLINE.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER

109
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,100
Are you kidding me? How much longer do I need to wait!

110
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,040
Damn, I'm hungry.

111
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't put appetite into the game!

112
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,730
And I actually want to pee. So surprised.

113
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,160
Is this the toilet?

114
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,240
It's even worse than the composting latrines...

115
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,600
It stinks. This sense of reality is also unnecessary!

116
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,760
That was close. Thank god, I held it back.

117
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,580
What? Is it a monster? Isn't it NPC?

118
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,000
But there was no one there just now.

119
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,610
Hiro...

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,620
How dare you? How dare you?

121
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,260
This voice, this figure.

122
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,080
Martin? Is that you, Martin?

123
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,770
But it's impossible. Martin had already...

124
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,200
At that time, he was...

125
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,460
Yes, you killed me.

126
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,740
This is a full dive horror game!

127
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,280
Spare me. It was an accident.

128
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:40,320
No, I was stabbed mercilessly by you, and I died miserably.

129
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,870
It's not like that. Didn't you eat the apple with a dagger, that was why...

130
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,900
Yes, I was eating an apple.

131
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,340
I didn't realize when I started eating the dagger.

132
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,630
What's so funny?

133
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,620
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,030
Hiro, we made an oath.

135
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,620
Tell me the oath we made under the kanura tree.

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,790
I don't know.

137
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,380
I don't know the strange tree or the oath!

138
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,030
Say it! Tell me the oath we made under the kanura tree.

139
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,240
What's that? Is it written in the manual?

140
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,590
No, there is no such thing these days!

141
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,370
Tell me the oath we made, now!

142
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,570
I really don't know.

143
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,250
Maybe we're supposed to be very good friends.

144
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,250
But actually, I've just started playing this game.

145
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,600
Is that so? Then there's no other way.

146
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,340
Do you understand?

147
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,800
I'll be in front of you every day until you remember.

148
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,250
Why would this happen?

149
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,920
I have no idea. There's no way I can remember it!

150
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,600
Martin time begins!

151
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,490
Is this called the Martin time?

152
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,450
Speaking of which,

153
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:17,340
Mr. Ginji can see the ghosts of the best friend killed by him and
childhood sweetheart.

154
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,910
What's up?

155
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,000
I still want to

156
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
live decades longer!

157
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,020
No, I've had enough of this game. Who can help me!

158
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,620
Miss Reona, what are you doing? Someone come and help me!

159
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,190
Let me finish the game quickly!

160
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,350
What's up?

161
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,770
Miss Reona, you're finally online.

162
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,250
No, that's not my name.

163
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,480
It doesn't matter. Please help me.

164
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,720
Martin time. Martin time has been...

165
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,350
What's that? Are you OK?

166
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,730
There's blood all over his face.

167
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,130
There's no blood on your face.

168
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,450
Leave it. Please help me.

169
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,830
I see. You need to calm down.

170
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,550
Are you Hiro? It's all right.

171
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,910
Who are you?

172
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,260
Me? I'm Mizarisa. Nice to meet you.

173
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,830
Where are we heading to?

174
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,390
Here.

175
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,590
Bed?

176
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,360
What's this?

177
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,980
It's time for fun.

178
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,140
It's going to be very exciting next?
WARNING! THE FOLLOWING CONTENT WILL BE VERY EXCITING. ARE YOU PREPARED

179
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,360
Is this...

180
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,360
Time for adults?

181
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,360
The five senses are represented so perfectly.

182
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,750
In other words, sexy and...

183
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,000
No, I don't want to play VR games for adults.

184
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,320
I just want to play the full dive adventure RPG.

185
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,780
No, wait a minute. It's an adventure, isn't it?

186
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm just curious.

187
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,710
I'd better enjoy it, right?

188
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,280
Please lie down first.

189
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,710
I see.

190
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Please close your eyes.

191
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,960
OK.

192
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,800
This must be some preparation.

193
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,460
She must be a warden of the prison.

194
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,870
She is the beautiful NPC who gives me peace

195
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,020
and gets me out of this prison.

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,280
Surprisingly, the game isn't that bad after all.

197
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,370
Here we go.

198
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,670
Don't open your eyes yet.

199
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,460
OK.

200
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,030
It's ready. Open your eyes.

201
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,150
OK.

202
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,550
Your Majesty?

203
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,770
It's really surprising. So exciting in the beginning?

204
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,960
Yes. The delightful heretical interrogation is about to begin!

205
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,840
Heretical interrogation?

206
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,320
What about that activity?

207
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm Mizarisa, the heretical inquisitor.

208
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm going to torture you now. Please get ready.

209
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,350
Will the torture hurt?

210
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,200
Hiro, you must be possessed by a demon.

211
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,720
I'm just helping you get rid of the demons. Don't worry.

212
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,670
I don't quite understand. Since you said so, I'm relieved.

213
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,450
If you don't make it through and plead guilty,

214
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,370
you're going to be jailed.

215
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,110
Otherwise, the demon will be the scapegoat, and you will be acquitted.

216
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,570
Come on!

217
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,200
OK, so how do you torture me?

218
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,340
Whip? Or a candle?

219
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:21,350
Amputation, of course.

220
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,080
Amputation?

221
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,440
No!

222
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:35,350
Pleasant voice, it makes me excited.

223
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:41,310
Help! Miss Reona, help me!

224
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,410
Hiro, are you OK?

225
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,510
Miss Reona!

226
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,150
You're too late. You sent me an message and said you'd get online.

227
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,890
Do you know what I went through!

228
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,610
I'm sorry, but I also...

229
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,040
Yes, Miss Reona has to fight Alicia

230
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,800
and take care of your store in the reality.

231
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,620
Fort of Apocalypse was on TV today.

232
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,750
I was fascinated and I lost track of time.

233
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,690
What are you doing? You must have seen it many times!

234
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,270
It's good, you'll find something new and touching every time you watch it.

235
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,830
Especially the perished spell part. The internet...

236
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,110
I don't care. Don't harangue.

237
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:25,650
Hiro, what have you been muttering about?

238
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,040
Are you so scared that you got mad?

239
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,420
That's not good. You shouldn't get mad before I do anything.

240
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,190
Miss R-Reona, please help me!

241
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,380
I got it!

242
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,590
Come on, Hiro, come on!

243
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,790
Come on, Hiro, come on!

244
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,650
What?

245
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,180
If you want to be acquitted, you have no choice but
to get through the torture.

246
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,750
So I'll spare no efforts to cheer for you here.

247
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,020
Until I get hoarse!

248
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,690
What the hell are you doing here?

249
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,240
The handcuffs are so tight that I can't get them off!

250
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,570
You can't even help me.

251
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,020
Now, I'll chop it.

252
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,630
No! Really?

253
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,960
Wait. No, no!

254
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,290
It's sharp, let's start with your right leg.

255
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,710
Stop it!

256
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,420
No!

257
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,310
Hiro, you wet your pants.

258
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,950
You're a high school student, and you wet your pant!

259
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,770
It's so beautiful.

260
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,010
What? What is this?

261
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,920
I've been a heretic inquisitor for 12 years.

262
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,810
It's the first time I've seen someone as beautiful as you.

263
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,510
So cute.

264
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,210
It's so cute. To cut off such a leg!

265
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,110
Hiro, buck up.

266
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,180
That's enough.

267
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,830
People like me can't do anything well anyway.

268
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,850
Hiro?

269
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,450
So no matter what it turns out to be...

270
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,970
Here I am.

271
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,450
Wait, stop the interrogation!

272
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,670
Why do I smell pee?

273
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,970
Anyway, stop the interrogation and put that thing down!

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,180
Why?

275
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,140
I don't know the details. Anyway, stop it.

276
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,720
This is the order of Lord Tesla, captain of the city guard.

277
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,300
Why! It's just getting fun.

278
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,260
What's this?

279
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,990
The Best Friend Killer peed his pants.

280
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,930
Peed his pants?

281
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,510
You're great, Hiro.

282
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,690
You avoided the torture by using "pee pants", this special order.

283
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,070
I don't want to give that order!

284
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,900
It's a trick. No one knows.

285
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,970
It's a trick that hasn't been discovered for decades.

286
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,760
Come on, get up.

287
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,650
DO YOU WANT TO EXIT THE GAME AFTER SAVING THE ADVENTURE DATA

288
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,720
Wait, Hiro, do you want to go offline?

289
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,750
It's finally getting fun.

290
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,510
It's not fun.

291
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,410
This kind of game sucks.

292
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,830
I've had enough of it, only idiots play this crappy game!
