1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,660
What… What's going on here, eh?

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,380
My stomach… It hurts!

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,230
Okay, all right now.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,780
I have to get to Tesla quickly.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,810
WHAT? A goblin is peeping at me!

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:37,290
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

7
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,950
Episode 11 City of Dead Ends

8
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,060
Miss Reona is here! She is here now!

9
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,540
Are you listening, Miss Reona?

10
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,250
Really? You took such a pile?

11
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,810
That's really great!

12
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,430
No! Did you misunderstand something?

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Hiro, are you all right?

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,970
Mizarisa!

15
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,690
No… Don't tell me…

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,680
Did you just save me?

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,870
Right! I followed you quietly to the toilet.

18
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,090
I thought this would be a good opportunity.

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,650
Didn't expect that goblin was on to you as well.

20
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,860
So, I cut its head off from behind.

21
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,960
That goblin got sloppy. I took care of it quite simply.

22
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,060
Not much of a reason to be praised for.

23
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,360
Thank you.

24
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,090
No problem.

25
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,770
By the way, did you sharpen your sword, Hiro?

26
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,840
A rusty sword is of no use.

27
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,940
Don't worry about that.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,030
Really? Show me, then.

29
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,180
What are you doing? You perverted sadistic girl!

30
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,580
Just a little jab,

31
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,000
and you had this expression.

32
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,360
You are the best, Hiro!

33
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,400
Now that the woman in the way is gone, I Can finally be alone with you.

34
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,410
Let me see more of your charming expressions.

35
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,620
Stop it!

36
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,470
You're still joking at a time like this.

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,320
I don't just cause you pain.

38
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,770
I can do things that make you comfortable.

39
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,710
You're trying to trick me again like this.

40
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,670
There's no such thing.

41
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,440
Look.

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,710
You can touch them.

43
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,030
Are you serious?

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,280
Turning on adult mode at a time like this?

45
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,300
It doesn't make me happy at all!

46
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,070
Are you idiots?

47
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,720
Don't do such meaningless things at a time like this!

48
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,680
Grrr, not a good time, you monster girl!

49
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,620
You got a problem, pervert girl? Don't make me cut you in half!

50
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,500
Funny! Try if you can!

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,500
Stop it!

52
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,470
Anyway, let's get to Tesla quickly!

53
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,330
It wouldn't be funny to be attacked by a goblin in such a place.

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,860
Hiro, wait for me!

55
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,160
Hiro, stop right there!

56
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,680
How dangerous. If I got involved with them,

57
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,440
I'd be dead before I was killed by goblins.

58
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,580
If I'm going to die anyway, I might as well be killed by goblins.

59
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,920
Wait, what kind of negative thinking am I doing?

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,250
Miss Reona, what were you doing?

61
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,390
I was almost attacked by a goblin and Mizarisa in the toilet!

62
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,920
Sorry. I was concerned about something.

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,830
What were you concerned about?

64
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,240
Look, so many split ends here, right?

65
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,610
Do you really want me to beat this game?

66
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,430
Not again!

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,930
I just came out from the toilet.

68
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,120
Maybe this is something that will continue unless the tension is removed.

69
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,430
Is there any such thing?

70
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,440
Crap! Am I going to fail again because of my nerves?

71
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,010
Again? What's that supposed to mean?

72
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,350
That's…

73
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,940
Can you tell me about your past?

74
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,870
But the first priority is to defeat goblins…

75
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,730
To defeat goblins, you have to deal with the stomachache first!

76
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,700
Right?

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,620
Well, that's true.

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,260
Hiro, I'm also an adult.

79
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,910
I wouldn't joke around at a time like this. Trust me!

80
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,430
I see. Actually…

81
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,970
Hiro, turns out you're a pants-wetting high schooler in reality too!

82
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,390
So hilarious!

83
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,560
Aren't you making such fun of me?

84
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,260
I was too stupid to believe you!

85
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,170
Kiwame Quest is a game that stays true to reality.

86
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,940
Just like you shit your pants during the athletics meet,

87
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,020
you'll also feel like you're about to shit your pants during the game.

88
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,450
It's not like that! I didn't shit my pants.

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,680
It doesn't matter if you shit your pants.

90
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,990
How does it not matter?

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,380
You don't care! How many times are you going to say "shit your pants"?

92
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,970
All right! If it was Kamuy, he'd say like this,

93
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,610
"You coward, stop worrying about such little things.

94
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,550
Even if you shit your pants, keep running!"

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,000
I told you I didn't shit my pants!

96
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,770
Besides, who would be able to run while taking a shit!

97
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
Well, still have a stomachache?

98
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,230
Eh? Don't seem to have it anymore.

99
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,190
Miss Reona, did you plan this?

100
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,060
I helped a little, didn't I?

101
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,940
Thank you.

102
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,180
Although I really don't know whether I should thank you or not.

103
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,580
Hiro, look at the title!

104
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,670
Got a new title at this time?

105
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,920
Shitting-Pants Best Friend Killer.

106
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,270
Shitting-Pants Best Friend Killer!

107
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,580
I said I didn't shit my pants!

108
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,000
Now that the stomachache is gone, hurry up and head for the north gate!

109
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Alicia and Mizarisa might have gone there already.

110
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,070
Right! I have to go help Tesla.

111
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,230
Everyone, concentrate and don't be afraid.

112
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,980
Yes, sir!

113
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,310
Why are there so many?

114
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,170
One is difficult enough to deal with, and there are so many!

115
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,430
In this way, even Tesla…

116
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,750
Go!

117
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,160
Extreme lightning!

118
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,010
That's Tesla!

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,850
But he's the only one who can fight goblins.

120
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,620
Mizarisa, can you beat goblins, too?

121
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,020
Barely.

122
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,650
Watermelon cut!

123
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,290
Apple cut!

124
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,250
Awesome! I didn't expect them to be so overpowering.

125
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,070
Extreme lightning!

126
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,600
My turn now.

127
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,700
Besides Tesla, there are Mizarisa and Alicia.

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,620
A great lineup!

129
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,000
Maybe we can get through the opening event at one go?

130
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,820
Yeah, that's what I mean.

131
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,140
All right, now the Tesla's Death Flag could be avoided.

132
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,710
My survival rate would also be greatly improved.

133
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,240
Report!

134
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,440
The goblins breached the south gate and are attacking Lady Gaban's mansion.

135
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,870
How is that possible? The south gate is a strong iron one.

136
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,160
And there should have been garrisoned by many powerful guards.

137
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,740
It only took one goblin to breach the iron gate.

138
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,000
And then...

139
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,750
Is it One-eyed?

140
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,160
Who is One-eyed?

141
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,970
Let's talk about it later. Everyone, proceed to Lady Gaban's mansion.

142
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,670
Yes, sir!

143
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,230
Are you both all right?

144
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,990
We're good. But Amos and Paru…

145
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,750
Those two… Although both of them are annoying.

146
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,460
They fled because they were afraid of the goblins.

147
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,290
Those two guys!

148
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,780
There are not many people left who can take part in combat

149
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,260
Hiro, go with Lord Tesla.

150
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,090
Got it.

151
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,690
What is that?

152
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,020
That is the king of goblins,

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,360
One-eyed!

154
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,410
One-eyed! This guy must be the reason why the survival rate is only 0.1%.

155
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,280
I fought it once a few years ago.

156
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,320
There was news that there were goblins killing around the city.

157
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,780
I was specially dispatched.

158
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,250
I was only able to blind it in one eye.

159
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,220
I just barely got away.

160
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,770
The cage! Bring me that cage!

161
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,530
Yes, sir!

162
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,470
Hiro!

163
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,260
Let's go!

164
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,780
I have to take down One-eyed and go out of city with you.

165
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,910
Don't do that, Tesla! This is definitely a Death Flag.

166
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,620
Look over here, One-eyed!

167
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,260
This is the man who blinded you!

168
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,010
So fast!

169
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,080
Tesla.

170
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,860
It's okay. All you have to think about is wetting your pants, Hiro.

171
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,210
What are you talking about at such a critical moment?

172
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,110
I'm not kidding. Honestly, you better wait, Hiro.

173
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,020
That guy is really something.

174
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,280
But…

175
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,500
That's right. Just leave that guy to us.

176
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,290
Alicia, you…

177
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,860
Lord Tesla is the pride of this city.

178
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,510
I won't let the likes of goblins kill him.

179
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,750
Oh, wow!

180
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,820
You've just said something nice, you monster girl.

181
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,510
These two have never seen eye to eye. Finally reconciled?

182
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,370
I don't know much about it, but it feels good.

183
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,950
Hiro, didn't Tesla just say "bring that cage"?

184
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah, he did said that.

185
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,490
That must be a hidden clue in this game.

186
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,140
In other words, if we manage to survive until the cage arrives,

187
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,920
we may have a chance to win.

188
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,480
So that's how it is.

189
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,600
Lord Tesla, I'm here to help!

190
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,800
Come on, Mizarisa!

191
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,990
Mizarisa?

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,380
Don't worry, Hiro. She just passed out.

193
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,530
Really? Although she is a pervert, it's good she's not dead.

194
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,530
But what was that?

195
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,140
It just kicked Mizarisa in the stomach.

196
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,270
Let me deal with it.

197
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,390
Alicia!

198
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,640
Can you see what's going on?

199
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,120
Not at all.

200
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,240
Me neither.

201
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,230
This should be the climax scene of the opening of the game, right?

202
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,040
Isn't it strange that I, the main character, can't see the battle clearly?

203
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,470
Look at that, Hiro!

204
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,290
Great, it's the cage! The cage is here!

205
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,970
What is this group of goblins?

206
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,070
This is Lord Tesla's secret strategy!

207
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,580
One-eyed may be shaken in confidence if it sees these goblins.

208
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,740
Look, these are your fellow goblins we just captured. Understand?

209
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,330
It worked. This guy surely has some intelligence.

210
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,620
It's over, One-eyed!

211
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,850
Yeah, the situation has reversed!

212
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,720
Great! So we've completed the Goblin Event.

213
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,860
I crossed the high wall of 0.1% survival rate.

214
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,700
Besides, Kamuy said it was 0.1%. This looks much easier than that.

215
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,150
Survival rate is 0.1%. Go to hell!

216
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,690
No, wait! The super-annoying Kamuy.

217
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,140
Would he exaggerate the strategy so much?

218
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,010
Without clearing this level, you won't know the secret of the City of Ted.

219
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,610
Just look around and think more.

220
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,970
The secret of the City of Ted? Look around and think more?

221
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
What does it mean? What does it mean?

222
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,410
So noisy! Be a little quiet…

223
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,320
Wait! Where have I heard this voice?

224
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,940
Could it be? No way! But this…

225
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,060
Wait, Tesla!

226
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,340
What, Hiro? What do you mean, "wait"?

227
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,920
Tesla, these goblins in this cage

228
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,330
were not captured just now.

229
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,490
They were captured and imprisoned before, right?

230
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,580
Hiro, what are you talking about out of nowhere?

231
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,430
Without stomachache, now you have a psychological problem?

232
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,780
Miss Reona, be quiet for a moment please.

233
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,480
When I was tortured by Mizarisa, when I was in the training center,

234
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,190
and when Ginji was put in prison, I heard this voice.

235
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,600
I always thought it was the voice of prisoners locked up in the dungeon.

236
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,450
But I was wrong.

237
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,300
That was the low roaring of goblins.

238
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,960
These goblins were already in the dungeon at that time.

239
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,400
These goblins have these kind of pale eyes

240
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,940
exactly because they have been locked up in a dark place for a long time

241
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,970
and lost their vision, isn't that so?

242
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,750
That means they were captured and imprisoned many years ago.

243
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,040
You are the only one who is able to do such a thing, Tesla.

244
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,740
Hiro, what reasoning adventure game are you playing in a full dive RPG?

245
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,250
You reasoning nerd, what are you thinking about?

246
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,350
Besides, why did Tesla do it?

247
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,710
Tesla, didn't I ask you to wait?

248
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,920
Hiro, what's the matter with you?

249
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,010
You are smarter than I thought.

250
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,610
You're right.

251
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,610
The goblins in this cage were captured from their cave seven years ago.

252
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,520
And the one I just killed, One-eyed, was their father.

253
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,860
Really?

254
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,290
How could it be, Lord Tesla?

255
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,470
Why would you do such a thing?

256
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,960
That's…

257
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,030
Lady Gaban!

258
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,110
Tesla, did you kill it?

259
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,260
Yes, my Lady. The situation was critical and I had to.

260
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,750
Is that so? Never mind.

261
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,160
Just grab some other little goblins.

262
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,710
Why on earth did you do such kind of thing, Lady Gaban?

263
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,960
The fear brought by goblins

264
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,960
was just enough to bind the people to this city.

265
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,230
Bind the people?

266
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,920
What does it mean?

267
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,430
A fully independent autonomous body not controlled by any king of Oberdyne

268
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,930
and with the same function as a state,

269
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,110
that is the City of Ted.

270
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,010
In fact, goblins are a highly intelligent race.

271
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,090
As long as we don't take the initiative to provoke them,

272
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,590
they will not simply attack humans.

273
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,340
But we believe that the ferocity they show when they hate humans

274
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,430
can be exploited.

275
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,030
It can be used to hold back those who approach Ted from the outside.

276
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,570
It can also be used to bind stupid ones who want to get out of the city.

277
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,660
They are the props that facilitate our domination of the city.

278
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,050
That is the real situation of those poor goblins.

279
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,670
That's right. It's all about maintaining the kingdom for me and Tesla.

280
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,300
It's so lame. I didn't expect Tesla to be such a gigolo.

281
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,910
Not to mention he's my favorite NPC.

282
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,790
Whether it's Kamuy or Tesla,

283
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,710
Miss Reona really has no good luck when it comes to men.

284
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,460
Shut up!

285
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,590
Oh, no!

286
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,140
Tesla, you won't even spare your own men?

287
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,970
Those who know the secrets of the City of Ted

288
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,790
and those who are close to the truth must die.

289
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,130
Of course, you are no exception, Hiro.

290
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,330
The strongest NPC, even stronger than the king of goblins,

291
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,160
Thunderous Tesla!

292
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,110
Can't leave the city unless I beat him.

293
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,520
This is the real survival rate of 0.1%.

294
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,950
