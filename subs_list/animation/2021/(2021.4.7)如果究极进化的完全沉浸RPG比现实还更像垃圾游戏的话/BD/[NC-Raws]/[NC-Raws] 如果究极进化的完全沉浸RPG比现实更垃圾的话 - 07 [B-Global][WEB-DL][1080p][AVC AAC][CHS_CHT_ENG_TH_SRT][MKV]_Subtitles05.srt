1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,860
What's going on?

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,450
I don't know.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,320
It's the first time I've seen this kind of thing.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,900
I didn't expect Tedo City to catch fire.

5
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,880
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

6
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,010
Episode 7 Survival Rate 0.1%

7
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,480
Run!

8
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,400
Hurry!

9
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,140
This...

10
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,250
What's going on? What happened?

11
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,050
Quiet you, piss off.

12
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,940
Excuse me, can you tell me what happened here?

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,720
Get out of my way!

14
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,160
Will someone tell me what's going on?

15
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,820
This is what happens when people panic.

16
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,320
They only care about themselves.

17
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,870
Who'd be considerate enough to tell you

18
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,870
what's going on?

19
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,150
But isn't this a game?

20
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,310
Then go and ask that guy to explain

21
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,180
while he fixes your sword.

22
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,680
Excuse me.

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,330
My sword is rusty, could you help me repair it?

24
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,110
Are you stupid? Does it seem like a good time?

25
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,370
Then, you don't have to fix my sword, but,

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,150
can you tell me what happened?

27
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,940
Are you serious?

28
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,650
The goblins attacked.

29
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,050
Goblins?

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,050
I thought this city was built to defend against goblins,

31
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,490
didn't they dig a moat around it?

32
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,620
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,020
There's a once-in-50-years drought

34
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,960
and the moat dried up,

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,340
so the goblins came to attack us.

36
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,960
A goblin attack, I didn't anticipate this kind of event.

37
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,780
Finally, I can fight a monster.

38
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,970
Then, please help me repair my sword.

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,250
Are you listening to me? I told you I don't have time.

40
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,030
If you help me I can fight the goblins.

41
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,590
I don't care.

42
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,610
It only needs fixing because you let it get rusty.

43
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,430
But the sword was rusty from the start.

44
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,530
Isn't this your sword? Where do you usually keep it?

45
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,720
In my house.

46
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,440
Are you kidding me?

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,060
Damn it, I can't stand talking to a fool like you.

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,430
The grindstone is there, repair it yourself.

49
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,050
How do I do that?

50
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,210
Use the grindstone to grind it from top to bottom, idiot.

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,180
From top to bottom.

52
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,060
Yes, that's the way.

53
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,790
It's seriously rusty.

54
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,850
Run!

55
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,700
Here!

56
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,160
Faster!

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,240
Come on!

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,430
They're coming!

59
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,670
The goblins are coming!

60
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,500
No!

61
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,420
They're coming!

62
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,550
Help!

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,330
They're coming!

64
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,910
Who can mend their sword at a time like this?

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,000
What's the matter, Hiro?

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,470
You're asking me what the matter is?

67
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,430
What kind of RPG protagonist would

68
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,640
fix their sword in a situation like this?

69
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,260
But if you don't get rid of the rust, you can't use that sword.

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,480
I can at least use it as a club.

71
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,790
Wait, that won't work!

72
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,200
Goblins are strong like little monsters!

73
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,240
Reona?

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,000
Hiro, you have no chance of winning. You will 120% die.

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,420
But the townspeople...

76
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,930
Hiro, calm down and listen to me.

77
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,230
Actually, I never told you this but,

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,850
if you die in Kiwame Quest,

79
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,270
something serious will happen to you.

80
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,180
That's right,

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,440
I don't know what happens if I die in this game.

82
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,520
Do you mean, if I die in this game,

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,110
I'll die in real life too?

84
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,580
You've read too many comics and novels.

85
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,310
Even though this game is "pursuing realism to the extreme",

86
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,580
you won't die in real life like some survival game.

87
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,940
Then what will happen?

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,930
It'll break.

89
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,670
Break? Some part of my body?

90
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,380
No,

91
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,370
if you die in Kiwame Quest,

92
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,550
the software and hardware will both break down.

93
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,910
Not just the software,

94
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,870
but my console too?

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,750
Right.

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,110
Why are you so sure?

97
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,500
Hasn't anything gone wrong with that game design?

98
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,410
Hiro, I think you've realized by now,

99
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,190
this is the "crappiest game ever".

100
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,380
Reona, you're finally telling me this now?

101
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,410
"The hardware dies with the player."

102
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,500
Because of this problem with the game system,

103
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,330
over the past ten years, many players

104
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,060
have sued the game creators.

105
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,640
But the game makers used their power and wealth

106
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,120
to silence them.

107
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,730
Wholesellers also ended up with lots of complaints,

108
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,260
(RETURNS)
and a ton of other problems.

109
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,570
So, not long after Kiwame Quest launched

110
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,120
it was named, "the crappiest, most garbage Full Dive RPG",

111
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,810
and buried away.

112
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,010
Do you understand now why selling this game

113
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,830
needs a processing fee now?

114
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,940
So why did you sell me this garbage game at its original price?

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,670
Let's not talk about it now, let's go offline first.

116
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,750
Although it's not good to rely on strategy websites,

117
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,770
these goblins are too strong.

118
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,800
Take a look at Obeldyne's Process when we're offline.

119
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,880
Come on, triple-touch.

120
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,330
DO YOU WANT TO EXIT THE GAME AFTER SAVING THE ADVENTURE DATA?

121
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,600
Great, looks like we can still save.

122
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,250
Let's go offline.

123
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,310
Wait a second.

124
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,680
Can I take a look at them? The goblins.

125
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,390
I guess it can't be helped. Just a quick look.

126
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,970
Thank you.

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,950
They're so realistic, it's like discovering a new kind of wildlife.

128
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,420
Hey, you're being too loud.

129
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,370
I really want to fight them as soon as possible.

130
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,250
Mom!

131
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,880
Reona, there's a little girl!

132
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,790
Wait, Hiro.

133
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,690
If you go, you'll be killed, is that really OK?

134
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,390
That console costs 100,000 yen.

135
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,440
By the way, our store sells it for 129,800 yen.

136
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,790
Are you running a scam?

137
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,220
Even if the console breaks, I won't buy a new one at your store.

138
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,700
You need to think clearly.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,420
The people under attack are just NPCs.

140
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,780
They're just "software performing human actions".

141
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,250
You don't have to be so frank about it.

142
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,070
She looks like a little girl, and...

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,120
I don't want to watch someone die,

144
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,350
even if she's a NPC.

145
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,110
I don't want to see any more lives lost.

146
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,130
Hiro.

147
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,120
You're...

148
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,490
a pedo, aren't you?

149
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,940
Where did you get that idea? I'm not!

150
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,290
Look, it's the guards. The town guards are here.

151
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,410
You monster.

152
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,440
If you come any closer, I'll cut you down.

153
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,130
This guy.

154
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,150
Damn it.

155
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,500
How are they so strong?

156
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,040
I just said, "I don't want to see any more lives lost,"

157
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,500
and two people just died in front of me.

158
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,020
So, do you understand how scary goblins are now?

159
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,250
Is that thing a first-level monster?

160
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,410
The players who were able to leave Tedo City

161
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,120
all left without fighting the goblins.

162
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,490
Is that so?

163
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,620
But, leaving the town under these circumstances...

164
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,030
Have any players beaten the goblins so far?

165
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,550
As far as I know, just Kamuy and Show Hey.

166
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,260
I know Kamuy, but Show Hey is...

167
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,500
In real life, Shouhei Aida is a boxing champion in East Asia.

168
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,620
When an interviewer

169
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,320
asked him who his strongest-ever opponent was,

170
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,750
-"Goblins."
-I think that was his reply.

171
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,120
No way! Goblins aren't boxers.

172
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,380
Anyway, I'm going to save her.

173
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,600
Are you serious? Do you want to die?

174
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,830
I'll take advantage of the commotion and help them escape.

175
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,400
I should be able to do that, at least.

176
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,260
Damn it, Hiro. Are you really such a hot-blooded young man?

177
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,050
Well, if you die and your console breaks down,

178
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,320
I'll give you a discount.

179
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,490
105,000 yen.

180
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,290
It's still more expensive than other stores.

181
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,690
Before that,

182
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,130
the blacksmith forgot to take those.

183
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,130
Change your pants.

184
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,600
Do I really have to wear that old guy's pants?

185
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,550
I don't really want to.

186
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,400
You won't be so intimidating smelling like urine, right?

187
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,840
But it'd be better to

188
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,370
save those people as soon as possible.

189
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,340
Just put them on!

190
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,920
You've been really stinky this whole time.

191
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,640
The whole time!

192
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,630
Mommy, help me!

193
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,920
Since I'm invisible, I'll go distract them.

194
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,570
Then you take that opportunity to save that little girl. Got it?

195
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,250
Got it.

196
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,750
I have to save that little girl, at least.

197
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,250
I'm sorry but there's no other way.

198
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,120
You need to switch gears and get ready.

199
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,750
If I hadn't changed pants I think I could have saved him too.

200
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,200
No, I need to concentrate on saving the little girl.

201
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,990
Let's go!

202
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,880
Watch this!

203
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,730
Now!

204
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,230
Come here.

205
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,510
Good. This is going well.

206
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,420
There were two of them?

207
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,110
This isn't going to work.

208
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
Sure enough, someone like me...

209
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,230
Big brother?

210
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,320
Kaede?

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,790
Run.

212
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,120
I told you to run.

213
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,300
If you want to attack, attack me.

214
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
This guy.

215
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,290
Damn it.

216
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,200
What was that?

217
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,020
Hiro, you're amazing. You run like a pro!

218
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
I'm not even sure what just happened,

219
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,090
even though I have confidence in my running skills.

220
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,370
Could it be that crisis stimulated my hidden potential?

221
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,750
But isn't this a game? Is it a bug?

222
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,970
I did my best, but the situation hasn't changed at all.

223
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,020
This is the end.

224
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,580
No, it's going to be OK!

225
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,490
Tesla.

226
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,010
Hiro, are you alright?

227
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,870
I'm fine, but...

228
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,120
Extreme lightning attack!

229
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,120
Awesome!

230
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,520
With talent and tireless effort,

231
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,890
he surpassed the goblins in agility.

232
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,620
The strongest guard in Tedo City,

233
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,390
Tesla Woolf Carmine.

234
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,500
Because he looks like lightning in his gold armor

235
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,390
he's known as "Thunderous Tesla".

236
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,370
He's the strongest NPC you can meet at the start.

237
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,440
You know a lot about him.

238
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,670
Well, since he's so handsome.

239
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,230
It's the guards.

240
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,190
Lord Tesla, great work.

241
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,570
-Take this little girl home.
-Yes, sir.

242
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,790
Everyone else, put out the spreading house fire.

243
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,270
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,110
-That must have been hard.
-Yeah.

245
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,920
I feel a bit like an RPG hero.

246
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,510
Hiro, you've got a new title,

247
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,580
"Best Friend Killer with a Lolita Complex".

248
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,000
No! Why?

249
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,430
It seems pretty accurate to me.

250
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,500
Didn't you save that girl just to get close to her?

251
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,320
I don't have those kinds of dirty ideas.

252
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,540
Damn it, what a waste of a good mood.

253
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,960
Oh no, the NPCs can't see Reona.

254
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,640
They probably think I'm a freak.

255
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,350
Hiro, so you're a warrior too.

256
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,510
What?

257
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,380
Please forgive this presumptuous request,

258
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,460
but every man counts. We need more warriors to guard our town.

259
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,420
Warriors?

260
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,170
You will, of course, be appropriately compensated.

261
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,120
Helping out temporarily is fine, too.

262
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,200
Would you like to join the town guards as a mercenary?

263
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,700
Mercenary.

264
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,320
The fixed path of an RPG.

265
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,900
And I can fight alongside Tesla.

266
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,600
I'll join. Please let me join!

267
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,670
Thank you.

268
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,380
Hey, is it a good idea to decide so hastily?

269
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,110
It's OK. I'll be safer with Tesla, right?

270
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,770
Maybe you're right.

271
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,800
Hiro, come with me when you are ready.

272
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,250
In the courtyard of Lord Gaban's mansion,

273
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,700
there is a training place for guards.

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,460
I'll take you there.

275
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,390
This must be the save point before the next event.

276
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,710
Today was exhausting.

277
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,570
Reona, let's call it a day.

278
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,870
(DO YOU WANT TO EXIT THE GAME AFTER SAVING THE ADVENTURE DATA?)
Right.

279
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,730
Don't forget to look at the Process!

280
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,150
Alright, it's finally starting to look like a real game.

281
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,140
Hey, you still playing that crappy game?

282
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,270
Yeah.

283
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,350
How can you keep playing?

284
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,420
I still have a lot of complaints about the game,

285
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,070
and I recently heard that

286
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,240
if the game ends, it will break your console too.

287
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,510
How could a game like that exist? It has so many issues.

288
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,530
It really does.

289
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,210
Calling it a garbage game doesn't even cover it.

290
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,500
I definitely don't want to play that game.

291
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,080
Right?

292
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,000
Hiro, you look happy.

293
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,660
I do?

294
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,540
Isn't complaining about something usually

295
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,470
the first step towards getting addicted?

296
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,950
Addicted? Me? Addicted to Kiwame Quest?

297
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,010
It's unbelievable difficult to play,

298
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,990
and my console will break when it's game over.

299
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,410
There is no doubt that it's a shitty game.

300
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,810
I'm going to go home and play it.

301
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,410
Okay, I'll take a look before I go online.

302
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,670
THE GOBLIN ATTACK

303
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,780
Yes, it's this one.

304
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,060
Yo, garbage bug, look at what you did.

305
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,940
There are lots of ways out of Tedo City.

306
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,830
Normally players just complete missions for the townspeople

307
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,730
as many as possible,

308
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,380
raise their reputation

309
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,110
and get permission from Lord Gaban to leave.

310
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,350
It's a lot of work, but it's the most reliable method.

311
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,920
Or you can force your way out of the city,

312
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,600
avoiding the goblins on your way to Flora City.

313
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,840
But that can only be achieved by extraordinary warriors.

314
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,950
Although there are other ways,

315
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,570
the most inconvenient of all is the goblin attack.

316
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,020
There are only a few options to get out of the city.

317
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,580
I'll show mercy on you and tell you them.

318
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,800
Remember to thank me, idiot.

319
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,150
He's still just as annoying.

320
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,410
Option one, fight them as a group.

321
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,360
If you have 100 NPCs and players I recommend this option.

322
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,940
But it's not easy to find so many people

323
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,280
for a friendless guy like you.

324
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,720
The survival rate of this option is 5%.

325
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,200
Option two, hide for four days,

326
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,620
and wait for the goblins to leave.

327
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,590
Find a house, dig a hole in the ground and hide.

328
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,150
But this way you'll never get out of the town.

329
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,360
Which you deserve, you useless cannon-fodder.

330
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,530
The survival rate of this option is 10%.

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,260
Option three is to join the town guards and fight with Tesla.

332
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,590
That's it.

333
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,190
In fact, this is the worst choice.

334
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,450
Even a genius like me would find it hard to progress from there.

335
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,250
For scumbags, idiots, pigs and baldies like you guys,

336
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,610
it's impossible.

337
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,610
The survival rate of this option is 0.1%. Go die.

338
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,830
The survival rate is 0.1%...

339
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,060
So the probability of the console breaking is 99.9%!

340
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,010
Episode 8 A New Team and a Baptism
