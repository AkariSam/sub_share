Episode 12 Reality⨯VR

2
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,210
Hey, Hiro, it seems that you really want to get out of this town.

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,260
But I'm sorry,

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,140
I can assure you that you'll never leave this town alive.

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,350
What should I do?

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,970
I can't even fight a regular goblin, let alone Tesla.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,140
I'll tell you something interesting.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,860
This whole time, I haven't been using my full power.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,570
There's a more advanced form of extreme lightning.

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,170
The faster "Lightning Extreme Despair."

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,070
I'll use it to send you off.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
But you probably won't be able to see it anyway.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,650
Of course, I can't even see his regular extreme lightning attack,

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,600
let alone the advanced one.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,090
Kill him, Tesla.

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,730
Take this, Lightning Extreme Despair!

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,150
Am I really going to die in the end after all?

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,150
If I die, it'll hurt right?

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,070
And the software and console will both break, this sucks.

20
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,870
Al…icia.

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,310
Your childhood friend took it for you?

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,290
Alicia took my…

23
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,510
How could that be, after all…

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,530
Why? Why would you save me?

25
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,980
Don't you want to kill me?

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,190
My brother told me in a dream,

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,120
"forgive him, it wasn't Hiro's fault".

28
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,570
I've been so terrible to you this whole time,

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,150
so, when I heard you'd become a mercenary,

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,090
I wanted to become one, too, so that I can protect you.

31
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,900
Alicia, you…

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,000
Hiro, I'm so happy!

33
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,310
You once said you wanted to marry me.

34
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,250
It really made me… happy.

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,800
Alicia, wait. Don't die!

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,840
Hiro, keep living for me

37
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,610
and my brother, OK?

38
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,870
Reona, do the NPCs that die in this world come back to life?

39
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,060
No.

40
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,000
Of course, this kind of trash super-realism game

41
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,580
wouldn't make it that easy.

42
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,280
Hiro, is the funeral almost over?

43
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,580
That girl died for nothing.

44
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,620
Her sacrifice only bought you a few more seconds.

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,310
Right, this is a game.

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,550
Just a dumb Full Dive RPG.

47
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,340
It was only an NPC that died, I understand that.

48
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,780
But…

49
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,860
Face your death, Hiro.

50
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,650
But, you're more annoying than people in real life!

51
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,390
What?

52
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,250
Did you dodge it by accident? Well, it won't happen again.

53
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,250
Lightning Extreme Despair!

54
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,010
What? This can't be. That wasn't an accident,

55
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,230
he used his sword to change its course.

56
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,300
Hiro, what the hell was that?

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,560
What kind of kid-manga-plot development was that?

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,140
This is actually too insane, I'm disgusted.

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,050
Don't call me disgusting!

60
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,370
It shocked me too.

61
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,190
I didn't think that trick Kamuy was talking about…

62
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,330
would work here, now, against this opponent.

63
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,040
So, you piece of trash,

64
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,880
I'm going to teach you a little trick,

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,470
that you can use outside Kiwame Quest too.

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,370
I think you know, this game is very realistic,

67
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,620
so, although not to the same extent,

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,860
it also exists in the real world.

69
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,950
But I've never seen anyone use this move in Kiwame Quest.

70
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,250
Only a handful of people actually use this technique in reality, too.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,390
The world is full of fools

72
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,120
Listen, you trash representative of the fools of this world.

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,060
The player's abilities in this game increase dramatically

74
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,240
as their emotions fluctuate.

75
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,370
But it doesn't work with just any emotion.

76
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,930
Unyielding faith, passion,

77
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,120
fortitude spilling from the depths of your soul

78
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,640
will take you beyond the limits of your body

79
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,230
and change even your very destiny.

80
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,880
This is a little Kiwame Quest trick.

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,390
No,

82
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,560
this is real life.

83
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,220
You scum, don't be so arrogant.

84
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,430
He avoided it again?

85
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,540
But he's just a layman who doesn't even know

86
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,560
the basics of sword fighting.

87
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,040
This can't be.

88
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,010
I can't see Hiro's moves!

89
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,290
Can a human, a real player do this kind of move?

90
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
He's just like…

91
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,120
Kamuy from back then.

92
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,540
Alright, you can do it, Hiro!

93
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,240
Kill him, then marry me!

94
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,790
Reona,

95
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,430
you're beautiful and have big boobs,

96
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,800
but I'm not very interested in getting married.

97
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,680
Huh?

98
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,770
The tables have turned, Hiro.

99
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,240
It's actually really rusty and old-looking.

100
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,330
How much does this game actually suck?

101
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,060
Don't pursue realism at a time like this!

102
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,310
It seems that God is on my side.

103
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,940
This is bad.

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,570
Die.

105
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,180
No, I've already pushed him to this point,

106
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,500
wait!

107
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,770
It's over! The console is going to break.

108
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,500
The Kanura tree?

109
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,770
Martin?

110
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,370
It's been a while. Hiro.

111
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,450
So I'm dead?

112
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,040
It's really been a long time.

113
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,790
Are you OK?

114
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,250
Not good at all.

115
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,820
I was killed by Tesla and my console is going to break.

116
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,620
And…

117
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,390
Martin, listen,

118
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,330
the truth is, Alicia, she…

119
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,620
She was also killed by Tesla.

120
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,030
Really? But you worked so hard.

121
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,880
Thank you, Martin.

122
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,000
You're welcome. Besides, Hiro, it's not over yet.

123
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,990
What?

124
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,250
Now is the time. Can you take me with you?

125
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,530
Take you with me?

126
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,110
Hey, you said you'd take me with you, back then.

127
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,520
I did say that.

128
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,450
Let's go together and fight together.

129
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,340
Martin.

130
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,610
It can't be.

131
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,540
What's that sword?

132
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,630
My golden sword…

133
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,850
Really? That sword is…

134
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,700
A magic sword.

135
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,360
Are you the cursed magic swordsman?

136
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,900
Magic… sword, what's that?

137
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,600
I see, Best Friend Killer Sword-User.
(BEST FRIEND KILLER SWORD-USER)

138
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,670
Best Friend Killer Sword-User.

139
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,980
Martin, did you hear that?

140
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,620
He said it was a cursed sword. How could he say that?

141
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,080
Moreover,

142
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,380
you're the one who's really cursed, aren't you, Tesla?

143
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,370
Although that's a powerful weapon,

144
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,010
if you can't hit me, it's useless.

145
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,290
And your sword will never hit me.

146
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,030
Let me show you,

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,330
the Lightning Extreme Despair advanced move.

148
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,520
Lightning Extreme Ultimate!

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
Hiro, I'll gouge out your eye, too.

150
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,050
Just like One-eyed.

151
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,500
Hiro, he's going to use the ultimate form. Isn't that bad?

152
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,780
Don't worry, Reona.

153
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,410
I won't lose.

154
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,100
Hiro.

155
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,890
I'm not trying to be brave, I really don't think I'll lose.

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
Ultimate? I've been in my ultimate form

157
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,850
ever since I killed Martin.

158
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,490
Take this, my fastest move!

159
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,860
Lightning Extreme Ultimate!

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,220
I see.

161
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,250
So how did you lose?

162
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,570
I was shocked, too.

163
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,250
How could I lose at a point like that?

164
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,600
I didn't imagine

165
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,260
that Gaban would push me to my knees.

166
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,020
I'm also reflecting on how we didn't notice her.

167
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,340
But it was really bloody, the way Tesla tortured you.

168
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,830
Really ZZ level.

169
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,190
Don't talk about it!

170
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't want to remember it.

171
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,150
Sorry.

172
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,940
And forcing me offline and back into reality was really harsh.

173
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,760
The game and console were both smoking.

174
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
So when will you play again?

175
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,550
What?

176
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,070
I know, you can't afford to buy a new game and console, right?

177
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:13,150
But it's OK, I like you a lot, so I'll lend them to you for free.

178
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,260
A special service for my future husband!

179
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,660
Let me think about it.

180
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,250
Really? You're not going to give it up, are you?

181
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,440
Hiro!

182
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,000
(PEOPLE WHO GOT ONE-EYED TO JOIN THE TEAM)
I haven't seen anyone get as close as you did in years!

183
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,760
(SCUM WHO KILLED GOBLIN KIDS IDIOT WHO KILLED GUARD FELLOW HATER OF GABAN)
You can be a little more confident!

184
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,890
Gob…

185
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,890
From when I first got the title of "Best Friend Killer",

186
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,220
I was seriously thinking of starting again from scratch.

187
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,540
But if I start over now,

188
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,240
everything I did will be for nothing,

189
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,020
just thinking about it makes me lose my motivation.

190
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,860
Wait, Reona.

191
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,420
What's wrong? Bathroom, again?

192
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,620
(WHO GOT KILLED AT LAST MINUTE BUT REFUSE TO GIVE UP AFTER CONSOLE BREAKS)
This wasn't here before.

193
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,500
Did it appear after I learned that trick?

194
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,880
Look, you still lost, you piece of trash.

195
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,770
I told you the survival rate was only 0.1%, didn't I?

196
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,870
This guy is so annoying.

197
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,160
What? After you were killed and your console broke,

198
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,980
you still want to keep playing Kiwame Quest?

199
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,500
Are you that masochistic?

200
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,520
Gross, seriously gross!

201
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,880
Shut up!

202
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,450
I said I'm not sure if I'll keep playing or not!

203
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,030
I'll tell you one thing, gross guy.

204
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,290
If you use the "special skill" I teach you now,

205
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,610
you can pick up playing from right before you died.

206
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,210
Secret skill?

207
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,320
Little tricks and secret skills,

208
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,440
so much for the pursuit of realism.

209
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,160
Start a new console and put the broken game in it,

210
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,600
and say this phrase within ten seconds.

211
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,460
Listen well,

212
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,770
shout this out loud…

213
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,400
Then put the new game in immediately.

214
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,480
If you're lucky, you can start over an hour before you died.

215
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,600
But even if you play again, you'll still be killed, you trash.

216
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,470
I can…continue with it!

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,120
And I can start playing from right before I died!

218
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,630
What's going on, Hiro?

219
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,600
"I can do it, I can do it", how gross.

220
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,190
I can start over an hour before you died, which means,

221
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,370
if I'm lucky, I can save Alicia this time.

222
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,770
All right, I'm motivated.

223
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,650
What's going on, Hiro?

224
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,660
I can start over an hour before I died!

225
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,550
I just need to shout that out loud.

226
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,440
Hiro, are you all right?

227
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,780
I'm kind of scared.

228
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,630
Of course I'm fine. Kamuy said it online.

229
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,290
Really? But even if you can do it all over again,

230
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,970
what if you lose to Tesla again?

231
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,550
I pretty much remember how to use that trick

232
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,220
but it's unlikely that I'll defeat Tesla.

233
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,570
One month, Reona.

234
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,450
Please wait for me for one month.

235
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,120
I have something I want to do before I continue the game.

236
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,110
Just for a dumb game. What am I doing?

237
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,570
But this feeling…

238
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,360
I used to just simply enjoy running.

239
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,940
I'm back.

240
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,320
It's almost time to go to school. You're trying hard, huh?

241
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,160
The air is better in the morning.

242
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,750
Running is better for you than playing games in your room.

243
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,930
Really?

244
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,830
Don't get me wrong!

245
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,500
It's just a little better than playing an unpopular Full Dive RPG.

246
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,800
Don't call it unpopular.

247
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,270
Right.

248
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,470
It has long exceeded the range of "unpopular"

249
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,700
and faded from the memory and disappeared.

250
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,960
It hasn't faded or disappeared, OK?

251
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,360
Besides, why do you hate Full Dive RPGs so much?

252
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,970
Right, and-

253
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,480
What?

254
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,890
You'll get heat stroke running with a towel around your neck.

255
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,510
So, be careful.

256
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,010
What a baffling girl.

257
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,540
Damn it.

258
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,710
Haven't you decided yet?

259
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,960
I told you, it's time to decide

260
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,200
if you'll continue your studies or start working.

261
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,060
It's OK.

262
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,150
I'm not in a hurry, I'll think about it thoroughly and tell you later.

263
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,440
Yuki, you look different.

264
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,270
Could it be, you read this book, too?

265
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,940
What?

266
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,790
I'm fed up, I was giving him a serious response.

267
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,860
But Hiro, you really have changed a little.

268
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,290
I've been running in the mornings, so I lost some weight.

269
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,780
No, not just your body, but your face.

270
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,560
Really?

271
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,450
Hiro, I heard you've been running and working out recently.

272
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,760
Yeah.

273
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,030
Hey, you're not working out

274
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,410
just so you can deal with us, are you?

275
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,250
No.

276
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,520
Then why are you doing it?

277
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,560
That's because,

278
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,770
I won.

279
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,430
Alright, it's time to punish

280
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,340
this arrogant little brat.

281
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,170
That scoundrel, I'll definitely kill him next time!

282
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,110
I really want to gouge out his eyes.

283
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,500
Hiro?

284
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,230
Who are you talking about?

285
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,280
Eye-gouging is a bit too much, right?

286
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,320
No, I'm talking about a game.

287
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,970
Bye!

288
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,690
Don't push yourself too hard.

289
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,230
If he gets violent, it'll be bad.

290
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,500
They definitely think I'm a weirdo.

291
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,310
You have to talk tough with guys like them.

292
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,030
Reona isn't very punctual, as expected.

293
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,260
I rushed over here for no reason.

294
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,050
Martin?

295
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,590
Yo, piece of trash.

296
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,850
Hey, I've always wanted to ask, who's the piece of trash?

297
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,320
Aren't you about the same age as me?

298
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,990
Why are you so arrogant?

299
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,730
What's wrong with calling trash "trash"?

300
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,080
Didn't you break your console and get killed by Tesla?

301
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,160
A complete piece of trash.

302
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,380
Yeah, you're right.

303
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,250
That said, I'm going to start over again.

304
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,350
Like you taught me.

305
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,490
You still want to play? It won't be easy.

306
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,940
About that, Kamuy,

307
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,930
since you know how to revive after your console breaks,

308
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,140
that means you've experienced it, too?

309
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,020
Who knows?

310
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,290
Hiro, come with me.

311
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,550
Let me teach you what reality is.

312
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,440
So why are you being so arrogant?

313
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,980
Hiro, are you awake?

314
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,470
Was I asleep? What did you just do?

315
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,640
It feels like I was touched by something soft.

316
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,390
Because your sleeping face was so cute

317
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,010
I couldn't help but step out of bounds.

318
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,530
What do you mean? What did you do?

319
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,740
It's a secret.

320
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,960
What did you do? I really care!

321
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,160
More importantly, Hiro, are you ready?

322
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,500
Let's just say I am.

323
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,840
I've been working out especially for this.

324
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,740
I've also simulated the battle.

325
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,100
Of course, I've also made the necessary preparations, so…

326
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,690
Let's go! To a place more real than real life,

327
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,550
that shitty game world.

328
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,920
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!
