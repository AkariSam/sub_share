1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,380
This is the ultimate next-gen full dive RPG!

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,300
If it's not good, I'm going to return it!

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,870
Noooo! He's dead!

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,830
Wait, wait, wait… What happened?

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,710
"Best Friend Killer."

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,000
So… He already screwed up?

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:39,270
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

8
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 2 Players of the Unpopular Game

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,340
"Best Friend Killer"? What do you mean that I…

10
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,970
That you killed your best friend at the very beginning?

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,590
You are a really special high schooler!

12
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,710
No, no! Listen, I can explain…

13
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,460
That was an accident!

14
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,590
That's what murders usually say.

15
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,770
That's not true! I just pushed him a bit and then…

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,460
So… You did it on purpose?

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,720
Of course not!

18
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,520
Please tell me how to restart the game.

19
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,900
That's not possible.

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,020
There's no "restart" in this game,

21
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,650
just like in real life.

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,830
That's why this game feels so true!

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,620
Is that something you should be proud of?

24
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,710
The Ultimate Mission will automatically save the record.

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
Even if you log out now,

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,750
next time you log in, you'll continue where you stopped last time.

27
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,250
So that means I'm going to be the "Best Friend Killer" forever?

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,550
Yes, and but the way, don't even try to change your software.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,090
Because all your history is saved on the hardware.

30
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,810
If you want to restore factory settings, you'll have to get a new hardware.

31
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,500
One "VR-NX" is 90 thousand yen…

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,820
I can't afford it.

33
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,170
You can get it in our shop!

34
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,400
And it's 120 thousand yen!

35
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,620
That's so expensive! Ok, that's it.

36
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,770
I want my money back!

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
I can't do it.

38
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,810
Why… Why?

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,080
No returning for whatever reason. That's what we adhere to.
(No returning for whatever justification (damage, defects) Store owner)

40
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,370
I'm going to sue you in the consumers' association!

41
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,940
I don't want to waste my time in bloody lawsuit with
a senior schooler with bright future

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,060
Think about my offer.

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,460
What do you mean? I already screwed up, right?

44
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,550
This game you are playing, Ultimate Mission, aka "UM",

45
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,810
is a full dive RPG released in limited amount in Japan ten years ago.

46
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Its warranty has expired.

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,590
Let's call it the most unpopular game in the history.

48
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,080
Anyway, the players of this game do exist, even though rarely.

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,910
There… There are still people who play this?

50
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,960
Yeah, Japan is a big country.

51
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,500
Among these players, there is one called Ginji.

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,080
Mr. Ginji… Sounds like he's going to steal money from my pocket.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,000
Mr. Ginji also killed his friend in the beginning of the game
ten years ago.

54
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,210
Go talk to him.

55
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,240
I… I see.

56
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,770
Before that, check your right pocket.

57
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,420
You have 30 gold now.

58
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,190
Buy yourself some cheap clothes.

59
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,060
Clothes?

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,830
Given your present situation, I'm afraid…

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,190
Have you heard that Mr. Martin was…

62
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,180
Yeah, he was murdered.

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,440
What? What a sunny youth he was! Who did that?

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,550
I heard that his best fiend Hiro did it.

65
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,620
The police is now after him.

66
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,980
What… I am already on the wanted list?

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,140
Yes. You are now totally wanted by the police.

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,170
Get yourself a plastic surgery if possible.

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,220
In real life, you mean? Instead of changing the role?

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,440
Anyway, the clothes shop is nearby.

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,600
Walk with your head down, as a public enemy does.

72
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,160
I don't want to play this game anymore.

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,550
(Tela Clothes Shop)

74
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,810
Here we are, Hiro!

75
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,270
We don't enter like this, do we?

76
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,950
Like in real life, customers are gods here.

77
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,450
Even if you look suspicious, they won't call the police right away.

78
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,910
Is that so?

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,370
Of course! I'm speaking from experience.

80
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,940
But I don't think so.

81
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,040
Welcome!

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,310
Hiro! This!

83
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,510
15 Gold? Pl… Please, I'll have this.

84
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,310
Sure.

85
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,010
Young man, humors about you are everywhere now!

86
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,140
Wait, this is not what you told me!

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,520
Please don't be nervous. I'm a businessman, I won't betray you!

88
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,550
Well, then…

89
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,680
25 Gold?

90
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,870
You've been rubbed!

91
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,500
But that's what NPCs of this game are. Is that close to real life?

92
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,420
More disgusting than real, I'd say!

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,940
Am I going to be overcharged every time I buy something?

94
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,480
That's why you have to meet Mr. Ginji!

95
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,330
Tell me where this Mr. Ginji is.

96
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,810
He's in a casino, since like, ten years ago.

97
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,310
Ten years? He must be addicted to it!

98
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,640
I don't know. Maybe he's just a loser.

99
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,670
No! How could you say that?

100
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,890
This town looks actually big.

101
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,940
Yeah, it's an interior city on Alfred Continent

102
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,570
with a prohibition of business with other towns.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,120
It's a large self-sufficient town who closed its door to the others.

104
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,550
That's Tedo City, also known as "the locked city".

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,740
The locked city…

106
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,800
Those who leave the city without permission will be put to death.

107
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,560
Nobody ever stood up against this rule?

108
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,010
Anyway, our first step is to leave this town.

109
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,380
Go talk to Mr. Ginji!

110
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,360
The casino is over there. You'll be alright here.

111
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,190
Right? That's good…

112
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,540
Hiro!

113
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,110
Alicia?!

114
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,080
Where have you been? I've been looking for you!

115
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,300
Why… How did she recognize me? I put my hoodie on!

116
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,020
I can recognize you from behind!

117
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,640
We grew up together, remember?

118
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,230
I'm having goose bumps!

119
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,790
So this is what a NPC featuring ultra-high-speed universal
artificial intelligence Al Abo looks like?

120
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,500
Full of autonomy, liberty and perspicacity.

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,440
It's not the moment of telling me this!

122
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,600
Hey, are you okay, Hiro?

123
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,410
Who are you talking to?

124
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,370
Oh yeah, a NPC can't feel the presence of Miss Reona.

125
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,850
Alicia, listen, that was an accident…

126
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,490
Yeah, I know.

127
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,300
Sorry for screaming at you, I wasn't normal.

128
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,180
Now I've calmed down.

129
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,040
Alicia…

130
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,180
Hiro, I used to be in love with you.

131
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,230
No, I still am.

132
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,320
So…

133
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,980
Yay! Now the misunderstanding is cleared up.

134
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,770
Now let me kill you!

135
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,740
Not at all!

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
Don't worry. I'll kill myself right after that.

137
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,880
And the three of us will be together again in that world!

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,020
No, she's completely crazy!

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,550
Come on, Hiro.

140
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,340
That's… That's the knife in Martin's…

141
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,030
That's right. I'm the fruit killer from hell.

142
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,970
I'm Alicia von Rotasen!

143
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,570
What kind of name is that? And what's happening now?

144
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,980
I'll cut you into pieces, like what I do with apples
when making juice out of them.

145
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,540
Watch out! Your friend is as fast as hell.

146
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,250
So many people choose her to be their partner.

147
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,610
Is she supposed to be my partner?

148
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,150
It's an open-ended script. You can choose whoever you want as your partner.

149
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,370
But it's common to have a childhood sweetheart and
best friend as partners, right?

150
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,660
But I've killed one of them, and now the other one is going to kill me!

151
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,750
Hiro, what are you saying to yourself?

152
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,720
Ah, I see. You are confessing to God, right?

153
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,630
Hiro.

154
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,530
Hiro! Run, run, run!

155
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,840
You'll be killed if you stop!

156
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,330
I don't want to!

157
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,030
Hiro, wait!

158
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,200
Turn right!

159
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,910
Yes!

160
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,820
Now turn left!

161
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,490
Yes!

162
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,150
Right!

163
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,610
Yes!

164
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,240
Left!

165
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,600
Yes!

166
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:55,990
Right!

167
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,370
Yes!

168
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:56,840
Left!

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,230
Yes!

170
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,170
Right!

171
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,720
Hiro, you are such a runner!

172
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,210
I know it's a game, but why do I feel so tired?

173
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,160
Both the five senses and the tiredness are reproduced!

174
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,380
Is that really necessary?

175
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,540
Ah? It's updated.

176
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,440
Best Friend Killer who runs fast.

177
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,230
Bravo! You got a new title!

178
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,320
Is it going to make me run faster?

179
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,220
No. It's just a collected item.

180
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,140
Why not collect more at a dash?

181
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,820
No, thanks. I just want to log out.

182
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,950
At this time?

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,910
I have to go to school tomorrow.

184
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,720
Just skip it. Enjoy yourself in the game.

185
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,870
I can't believe an adult is telling me this!

186
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,250
Staying at home is also a lifestyle.

187
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,580
Even so, I still want to log out today.

188
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,500
Ok, you win. Don't forget to save before you log out.

189
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,290
Hm? Where's the dialog box?

190
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,620
Saving is not allowed in UM.

191
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,770
Which means…

192
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,750
This fight is still going on!

193
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,240
Here you are!

194
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,000
It hurts!

195
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,890
Calm down. In real life you'd even feel much more pain.

196
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,580
The pain I'm feeling is already too much!

197
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,340
In this game, even if you break your arms or legs,

198
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,940
it will just be like falling down from a stair.

199
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,510
Reassuring, right?

200
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,760
Are you kidding me?

201
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,610
You've been talking to yourself for a while.

202
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,030
I can't take it!

203
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,120
My eyes!

204
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,170
Here! Here! Watch this!

205
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,550
Miss Reona…

206
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,890
Damn you!

207
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,850
Hiro, go! Run!

208
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,610
O… Okay…

209
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,490
Listen, Hiro!

210
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,470
Even if you run to the end of the world, I'll find you and kill you!

211
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,170
I'm the fruit killer from hell!

212
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,920
The fruit killer from hell, Alicia!

213
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,720
What the hell is this game?

214
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,900
When was the last time that I ran like this?

215
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,340
A new message from Miss Reona.

216
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,370
Miss Roena?

217
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,200
Let's play Ultimate Mission today. When is your school over?

218
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,190
I'll be there. You too! You must!

219
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,270
Is this a threat?

220
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,860
Did you get the new game?

221
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,940
I was forced to buy a weird full dive RPG.

222
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,340
What is that?

223
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,620
It feels really like real life.

224
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,850
I feel pain and everything, even in a game!

225
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,700
So the so-called junk game?

226
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,200
That's right!

227
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,220
Sorry about yesterday.

228
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,640
Playing game is your hobby. I shouldn't have said that.

229
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,870
Never mind.

230
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,080
Thank you. But still I think games are old-fashioned and childish.

231
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,620
Listen, Hiro,

232
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,390
you should explain things to them.

233
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,350
This is really nice, right?

234
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,120
Exactly! Buy it!

235
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,720
Hiro is such a good friend to us!

236
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,240
That's right!

237
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,360
I have nothing to do with them.

238
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,160
They will look down upon you if you keep playing video games.

239
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,480
Well, maybe.

240
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,900
"Old-fashioned and childish"…

241
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,200
Will people look down up me?

242
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,990
Kaede?

243
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,940
Playing games again? Just as I expected.

244
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,650
No, it was…

245
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,610
So annoying of you.

246
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,320
You yelled again last night, right?

247
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Yeah, sorry about that.

248
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,540
But don't worry, it's just a game.

249
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,100
Who would worry about you…

250
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,120
Stop playing games. I'm serious.

251
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,710
Is that a problem? It's my hobby!

252
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,910
You'd better go running, like you used to!

253
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,460
I'm not going to do that again…

254
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
Anyway, stop playing games until middle of the night!

255
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,410
Or play them with your eyes, nose and mouth sealed up!

256
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,550
I'd die!

257
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,650
What the heck! They are all the same…

258
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,010
"I'll be there. You too! You must!"

259
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,960
Why, they are just games…

260
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,960
Ouch… So I start from where I've stopped?

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,540
Still so much pain…

262
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:53,110
There's a silver coin in my right pocket, another early equipment.

263
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,250
There it is!

264
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,830
It stinks!

265
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,140
Even the herb smells like in real life.

266
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,120
Normally, in a full dive RPG,

267
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,350
this should start some effects, right?

268
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,490
Hey, I'm talking to you.

269
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,070
Hey, say something. How are you?

270
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,620
How are you? Are you okay?

271
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
Hey, hey! Answer me!

272
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,820
Nothing happens?

273
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,150
It's getting withered.

274
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,300
Do I have to use it like in real life?

275
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,020
Wait, how do you use a herb?

276
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,140
Make it a patch, or a potion?

277
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,840
I have no idea.

278
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,500
And the blood keeps running!

279
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,870
What the heck is happening?

280
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,300
What happened to you? I've never seen a NPC like you here.

281
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,510
No, I'm not a NPC.

282
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,580
What, NPC?

283
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,890
He knows what a NPC is! Is he…

284
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,610
Mr. Ginji?

285
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,690
How do you know my name?

286
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,860
He is Ginji! I'm a player of this game from real life!

287
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,480
And I was looking for you, because I started the game
in the same way as your…

288
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,210
Such a young man play this unpopular game? What a loser!

289
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,880
I might be a loser in this game, but not in my real life!

290
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,740
Show me your herb.

291
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,930
It makes me think of ten years ago…

292
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,430
That hurts! Are you sure it's going to work?

293
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
No, the pain will last for a couple of days.

294
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,440
But it's a herb! Why it's exactly the same as common treatment.

295
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,020
Thank you, anyway.

296
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,600
You are welcome. We are both players of this unpopular game.

297
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,950
You were looking for me, you said?

298
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,590
This place is not safe. Come with me.

299
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,550
This is the casino?

300
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,960
Come have a drink!

301
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,770
Is this alcohol? I'm still a minor.

302
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,000
It's not alcohol, it tastes like Coke.

303
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,590
Re… Really?

304
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,690
Yummy!

305
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,920
So good!

306
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,300
How could he get drunk on this? What a weirdo.

307
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,940
What do you want to know from me?

308
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,110
Yeah, right…

309
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,320
I heard that you killed your best friend.

310
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,960
Actually me too, I…

311
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Well, it was an accident…

312
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,570
You killed him too?!

313
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,220
I didn't mean to!

314
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,720
How dare you…

315
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,590
It's true!

316
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,200
Hey, I'm talking with him, okay?

317
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,610
I've told you I didn't have the answer!

318
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,090
And that hasn't changed since the very first day!

319
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,510
That's really horrible…

320
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,200
Sorry. In fact this happens every ten years,

321
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,840
but it never happens on the same day.

322
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,500
What do you mean?

323
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,450
You'll understand. Very soon.

324
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,730
Where was I? The fact that I killed Enric?

325
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,570
Enric? Is that your best friend?

326
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,950
Mine is called Martin.

327
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,220
Every player's best friend has a different name.

328
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,250
Is that so? Why did you kill your best friend NPC?

329
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,830
It was a mistake I made when I was young.

330
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,550
You always want to try someone in a shooting game, you see what I mean?

331
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,520
Most people won't think so.

332
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,500
Enric told me he was my best friend at the very beginning,
and I was pissed off.

333
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,010
So I killed him.

334
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,660
That… That's all?

335
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,960
I do judo. It didn't take me long.

336
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,920
And I also killed the annoying young girl.

337
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,170
Do people really do that in this VR game?

338
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,120
You do judo in real life, right?

339
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,020
Even if you are good at it in real life…

340
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,750
Your body in this game is how it is in real life.

341
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,040
Really? So do you work out in real life in order to clear the game?

342
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,330
It's a full dive game, you see…

343
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,440
If you are not strong or smart enough,

344
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,260
you can never leave this town.

345
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,790
Who could possibly clear the game?

346
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,350
Some can!

347
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,610
Someone managed to clear the ultra-difficult game.

348
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,840
I saw that only one.

349
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,950
I will never forget it, despite my bad memory.

350
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,200
He was smart, nimble.

351
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,340
He looked like an ordinary student,

352
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,810
but his air distinguished himself from all other players.

353
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,500
He got out of Tedo City pretty soon.

354
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,400
And he cleared the game with little effort.

355
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,250
His name is Kamuy,

356
00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:00,260
and his title is "the invincible adventurer".

357
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,240
Sounds so cool!

358
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,640
So much better than "Best Friend Killer"!

359
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,690
I'm "inhuman ".

360
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,840
I've led a dog's life for forty-five years.

361
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,940
I even skipped my work at the convenience store.

362
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,430
Well, you are really inhuman.

363
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,250
What should I do now?

364
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,210
Do you want me to help you?

365
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,680
Why, you want to be my partner?

366
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,020
I'm too old for that.

367
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,860
Too old to play games! It's childish and silly.

368
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,920
But you are still in the game, right?

369
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,750
Also, I have gout. Sometimes I can't control my body.

370
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,190
So how are you going to help me?

371
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,270
You'll see.

372
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:58,590
Come! Best Friend Killer is here! Call the town guards!

373
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,960
Wait… What?

374
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,950
Inhuman!

375
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,730
