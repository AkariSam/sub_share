1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,750
Die!

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,030
Who the hell are you?

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,150
I'm Heretic Inquisitor Mizarisa.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,260
I'm the one who's going to stop you from killing

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,090
"Mr. Wetting Pants".

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,590
No, why is it you?

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:39,350
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

8
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,010
Episode 6 Knife vs. Saw

9
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,540
Hiro is under my protection.

10
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,140
Why would you…

11
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,230
Yes, why would you, a Heretic Inquisitor, come to save Hiro?

12
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,410
Because he was acquitted.

13
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,340
That was the decision of Lord Tesla, Captain of the Guard.

14
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,310
Everyone in town should know

15
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,990
that he has absolute judicial authority.

16
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,400
It means...

17
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,750
If you disobey his ruling and injure Hiro,

18
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,370
then I will punish you.

19
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,440
Good job, Mizarisa!

20
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,570
This should get things down.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,770
Wait, how did you know I was going to be attacked?

22
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,470
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,010
In order to make friends with you,

24
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,470
I've been secretly following you.

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,900
What, you were following me? I didn't notice at all.

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,110
Don't underestimate a Heretic Inquisitor.

27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,250
Could it be that there's a special "tracking" skill?

28
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,120
Hiro, how about we get her to become a companion?

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,210
True, even though our relationship has been quite dramatic,

30
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,630
she seems to have a good impression of me.

31
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,160
Besides, if she has special skills…

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,880
I have a good nose.

33
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,250
I followed the smell of your pee.

34
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,210
What...What kind of skill is that?

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,680
My pee smells really that strong?

36
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,400
I was worried I'll hurt your feelings, so I didn't say anything,

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,090
but that smell is truly pungent.

38
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,860
Then you should have told me earlier!

39
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,710
It's even embarrassing that you said nothing to me!

40
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,090
This game delves into the extremes of realism.

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,960
Like when a character in a funny comic gets hurt,

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,810
and the injury is gone in the next frame,

43
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,340
in reality, pee smells don't just disappear without you noticing.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,710
Really? After this, I definitely need to buy new pants.

45
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,620
Pity but so close.

46
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,110
Hey you, why do you want to attack Hiro?

47
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,430
Didn't you hear what I said?

48
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,960
No, I didn't hear anything.

49
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,510
That is to say, while I am killing the murderer Hiro

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,990
and his female assistant,

51
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,660
I don't know that he'd been acquitted.

52
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,160
You're really going to pretend you don't know

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,330
and kill me and Mizarisa?

54
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,160
There's something seriously wrong with her.

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,730
Come on then, if you think you can kill me, try.

56
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,880
How can an ordinary woman

57
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,310
kill a specially trained Heretic Inquisitor?

58
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,820
Just watching me smash your head into pieces!

59
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,230
This is going too far.

60
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,630
Where's she?

61
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,850
How can that be?

62
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,520
Where did she go?

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,850
There she is!

64
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,370
What kind of childhood sweetheart is this, a Ninja?

65
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,310
She's so powerful!

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,980
I'm going to kill you!

67
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,860
I'm going to kill you both!

68
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,500
Yes! Now she can't...

69
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,180
Now there are two daggers! Where did she get them from?

70
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,860
It seems that I underestimated you.

71
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,200
But I'm not to be pushed around. I'll never let you kill Hiro.

72
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,140
Mizarisa, I really want you to be my companion now!

73
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,100
Actually, what I just said was just a pretext.

74
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,120
Let me tell you why I must protect Hiro.

75
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,930
The real reason?

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,720
The more he suffers, the stronger he will be!

77
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,830
What? What are you talking about?

78
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,380
I won't kill Hiro, I'll torture him half to death.

79
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,120
I want to cut off his limbs and blind him.

80
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,660
Make him lose control of his bladder again.

81
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,160
The thought of him wetting himself from fear,

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,470
makes me incredibly excited.

83
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,260
What the heck is she talking about? She's as sick as Alicia!

84
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,910
If you kill Hiro, he won't ever pee his pants again.

85
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,750
What are you laughing about?

86
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,930
Though you're powerful, you're too slow.

87
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,080
And do you think you can rely on that crappy saw

88
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
to repel my attacks?

89
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,680
You monster girl.

90
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,000
Let me show you, the slicing power of a fruit knife.

91
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,330
No, she is getting worn out.

92
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,160
I feel like Mizarisa has a plan.

93
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,060
Like a boxer waiting for an opening to throw another punch.

94
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,140
You attacks fast, but predicable.

95
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,680
Once I seize the timing, I can block your moves.

96
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,380
Of course, specially trained Mizarisa must be better at fighting.

97
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,250
So die!

98
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,910
How could this be possible?

99
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,630
I focused on attacking up top,

100
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,130
and ended up getting kicked in the middle.

101
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,110
Don't you just use your dagger to fight, monster?

102
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,200
Mizarisa!

103
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,060
It's okay. She just passed out.

104
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,190
I'll keep her life for a while. Don't worry.

105
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,370
I'm going to kill you first, Hiro!

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,070
We dead this time! Alicia is invincible.

107
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,560
I can't defeat this childhood sweetheart!

108
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,270
If you can't win with a frontal attack, use your head.

109
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,450
Think of ways to win without fighting.

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,700
If you can't win with a frontal attack, use your head.

111
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,260
Hiro, Hiro, Hiro.

112
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,460
Hiro, I'll buy you some time, run!

113
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,490
I can feel something.

114
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,620
Hiro, are you also under the protection of a fairy?

115
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,370
Then I need to protect my eyes this time.

116
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,780
How can it turn out like this. Run, Hiro.

117
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,120
Escape to the town center.

118
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,920
Hiro?

119
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,630
If you were your childhood sweetheart,

120
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,030
what would you fear the most?

121
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,510
I understand, Kamuy.

122
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,740
What 2D, 3D and Full Dive RPGs all have in common,

123
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,290
what women have hated from the past to the present day?

124
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,870
That's it!

125
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,290
Okay, how about this?

126
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,000
Did you think I'd react like that?

127
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,150
W-what?

128
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,710
Don't underestimate me, I'm a young girl.

129
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,620
Of course men have fondled my breasts before.

130
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,230
Even this is so realistic?

131
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,860
Don't be so smug fondling my tits, you virgin bastard.

132
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,250
I only used my half-strength to kick that girl.

133
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,050
You're so weak.

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,790
This really is the last blow, Hiro.

135
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,230
Hiro, run!

136
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,710
I can't move. Why?

137
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,240
Her stomach kick is really powerful.

138
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,870
Hiro, join me here quickly.

139
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,050
Martin is here too?

140
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,460
I can feel it. I can feel my brother is close by.

141
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,500
Brother, I will kill Hiro for you.

142
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,610
Kill him. Alicia kill Hiro!

143
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,130
The game's over, checkmate. I'm done.

144
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,000
Hiro, don't give up.

145
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,760
What the heck is Obeldyne's process?

146
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,780
Garbage strategy website.

147
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,920
I've been trying to think of "things women hate".

148
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,590
Wait, did he really said that?

149
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,480
Imagine you were your childhood sweetheart.

150
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,500
Does it mean what present Alicia hate the most right now?

151
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,170
That means…

152
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,170
It's over. Die, Hiro!

153
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,030
I love you!

154
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,600
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,800
Alicia, I love you.

156
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,750
You're about to die, why are you spouting this nonsense?

157
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,020
No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

158
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,480
Alicia, I love you.

159
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,570
What are you talking about?

160
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,500
It works.

161
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,460
Well done, Hiro.

162
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,010
"A love message from the person that you hate the most"

163
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,620
That's annoying indeed.

164
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,360
How could Hiro like me?

165
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,120
Don't lie, you bastard!

166
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,880
It's not a lie. I've had feelings for you for a long time.

167
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,380
I like everything about you. I can't live without you.

168
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,730
Marry me and be my miso soup.

169
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,790
I want to have lots of babies with you.

170
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,050
What? What the hell is this?

171
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,300
What's wrong with you?

172
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,900
Well, one last step left.

173
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,490
Alicia, stop. Let's go back to what we used to be.

174
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,830
It's too late.

175
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,500
It's too late. It's too late. It's too late!

176
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,940
It's already too late.

177
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,550
I have feelings for you, too. My brother and I loved you!

178
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,170
But what did you do?p

179
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,030
Didn't I tell you over and over? It was an accident.

180
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,190
Don't say it was an accident, it was unintentional.

181
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,570
If you hadn't said that crap about getting out of town,

182
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,890
this tragedy wouldn't have happened.

183
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,230
It's all your fault. You've messed up our lives.

184
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,520
But I...

185
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,370
Someone died. A person died.

186
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,010
And it was my beloved brother.

187
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,670
But, but why, why did you…

188
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,870
Why did you ran away?

189
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,890
Isn't this great? You escaped from certain death!

190
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,340
I…

191
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,470
What's wrong?

192
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,870
I think I've been wrong.

193
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,370
Hiro.

194
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,220
I thought that everything that happened was just a game.

195
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,620
After all, I have no memories of Alicia and Martin.

196
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,140
But for them, for Alicia,

197
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,800
I was her childhood sweetheart, right?

198
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,210
But I killed her brother, my best friend.

199
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,140
And then I ran away.

200
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,870
I wasn't compunctious, I didn't help.

201
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,210
I was afraid and ran away.

202
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,100
This is the most serious crime I've ever committed.

203
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,110
I'm so awful.

204
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,580
Don't be so hard on yourself.

205
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,090
After all, they're just NPCs.

206
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,830
Ouch.

207
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,650
It's the first time I've met such a strong woman.

208
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,860
Mizarisa, thank you.

209
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,690
You're welcome, but there's a price.

210
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,700
Can I cut off your little finger?

211
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,970
Of course not!

212
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,100
I'm not grateful anymore, go away.

213
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,800
You need to visit the blacksmith.

214
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,750
By the way, Reona,

215
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,740
do you know the Kanura tree?

216
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,540
What?

217
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,290
The Kanura tree.

218
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,530
It's a big tree on the hill near this house.

219
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,270
Can you wait for me a moment?

220
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,710
Are you going to relieve yourself, Hiro?

221
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,970
It's not that, please wait for me here.

222
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,830
Martin, are you here?

223
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,620
Come out.

224
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,360
Hiro.

225
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,130
Martin, here you are.

226
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,960
Aren't you shocked?

227
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,800
You've appeared so many times, I'm used to it.

228
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,700
Are you ready to die?

229
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,090
I'm not, I'm sorry, but I have something to tell you.

230
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,870
I truly want to apologize to you.

231
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,130
But my words fail me when I see you.

232
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,190
What should I say?

233
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,910
Damn it.

234
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,580
Kamuy, a dumb, ordinary guy like me can't understand this.

235
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,730
What would you say if you were me?

236
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,080
Isn't it in the game's backstory? Think about it, idiot.

237
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,480
Ah! Because the language was so vulgar,

238
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,900
I just skipped through it.

239
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,860
So that was your way of giving me advice.

240
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,410
You don't have to forgive me, but come with me.

241
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,580
Martin, come with me.

242
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,740
Martin, Hiro has been chasing me.

243
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,920
Hey, Hiro, don't tease Alicia too much.

244
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,850
Sorry, I got carried away.

245
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,730
Wait, why am I the only one who looks so stupid.

246
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,330
Brother, please say something!

247
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,760
Don't worry about it, Alicia. Hiro is reflecting on what he did.

248
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,800
My self-reflection is deeper than the ocean.

249
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,780
You're always so nice to Hiro.

250
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,630
Of course, Hiro and I are friends.

251
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,580
No, closer than friends.

252
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,830
Martin and I are best friends.

253
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,290
Yes, we're best friends!

254
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,940
Right, our friendship will never change.

255
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,810
Hiro, you and me!

256
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,900
Yes, me and Martin!

257
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,720
We're the kind of friends that "even death can't separate".

258
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,550
You're right, Hiro. That was our promise.

259
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,460
Wait, are you going to disappear?

260
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,210
Yes.

261
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,200
No! Didn't I say I was going to take you with me?

262
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,290
You've already conveyed your feelings to me.

263
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,610
Then come with me.

264
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,980
My time has come.

265
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,250
Thank you, Hiro.

266
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,830
Hiro.

267
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,790
Reona, did you see all of that?

268
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,960
Yes, sorry.

269
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,030
Is that so? It's okay.

270
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,020
It's okay.

271
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,140
But Martin, he…

272
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,700
I was watching you the whole time,

273
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,710
but I couldn't see or hear Martin.

274
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,630
So you just looked like a creepy guy in a park talking to himself.

275
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,340
That's too harsh.

276
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,960
More importantly, look, it's glowing!

277
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,330
More importantly? You…

278
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,890
"Best of Best Friend Killer".

279
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,080
I don't know what that means.

280
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,500
Don't make that face.

281
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,750
You got a wonderful title and got rid of Martin's ghost.

282
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,960
You should look happier.

283
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,280
But Alicia, she still…

284
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,610
Let's leave that misunderstanding until next time.

285
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,880
Now you can definitely handle it.

286
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,090
Can I?

287
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,150
Of course! So let's take this rusty sword to the blacksmith.

288
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,320
You'll need to replace those smelly pants too.

289
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,390
I almost forgot!

290
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,410
You really are something, Hiro.

291
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,110
Are those church bells?

292
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,480
What is that?

293
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,060
What's going on?

294
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,170
I don't know either.

295
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,230
It's the first time I've seen this kind of thing.

296
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,520
The Tedo City is on fire...

297
