1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,560
…to join the town guard and fight with Tesla.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,710
Even a genius like me would find it

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,750
hard to progress from there.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,550
The survival rate is 0.1%…

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,980
…so the probability of the console breaking is 99.9%!

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:39,250
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shittier Than Real Life!

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,920
Episode 8 Enlistment and Baptism

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,510
A survival rate of 0.1%.

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,400
If I want to give up I guess now is the time, right?

10
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,390
THE ONE WHO SHIT HIS PANTS AND BECOME A MERCENARY AFTER THE GOBLIN ATTACK.

11
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,040
I didn't shit my pants.

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,720
You really are unbelievably stupid.

13
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,120
Your console will definitely break, please accept the loss.

14
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,720
Shut up!

15
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,650
The reason I'm reading this strategy website is to avoid that!

16
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,250
However,

17
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,440
if you have the "Best Best Friend Killer" title,

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,590
then maybe your chances aren't zero.

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,750
That title…

20
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,650
Even though you certainly don't.

21
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,570
Alright, it's hopeless,

22
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,940
just accept your certain death.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,310
No, I told you I have it!

24
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,340
PEOPLE WHO HAVE OBTAINED THE "BEST BEST FRIEND KILLER" TITLE

25
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,520
You're kidding me, right?

26
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,270
Then type in that pledge for me.

27
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,310
TYPE IT IN.

28
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,650
Why do you even need security measures on a walkthrough?

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,610
BEST FRIENDS EVEN AFTER DEATH

30
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,110
I didn't expect that after being haunted by a ghost,

31
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,590
you'd still be able to shake off that

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,810
crazy childhood sweetheart.

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,550
I should give you some credit.

34
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,580
Some people have searched for that pledge

35
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,830
in vain for more than ten years.

36
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,620
Alright then, I'll teach you a special little Kiwame Quest trick.

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,270
A little trick…

38
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,150
Your chances of survival might rise from 0.1% to 0.5%.

39
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,160
There's not much difference at all!

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,150
You need to endure for five days after becoming a mercenary,

41
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,930
until the next goblin attack.

42
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,610
But during this period some players might suffer mental issues.

43
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,970
Really? This game is awful.

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,330
It must be hard for you guys with so little fighting power.

45
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,190
If you can't even overcome this,

46
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,030
you won't be able to do anything later.

47
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,740
Let me see that little determination of yours.

48
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,660
The goblin attack is a SS level hell event.

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,740
But there's no way to learn

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,160
the secrets of Tedo City without passing it.

51
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,710
Try to have a look around, and think about it.

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,470
Even though the survival rate is only 0.1%,

53
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,690
I managed to clear this level.

54
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,120
In another word,

55
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,270
the success rate is lower than the sea level, but it's not impossible.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
Got it, trash?

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,750
Although he's as foul-mouthed as always…

58
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,980
I feel like he's trying to ask, "Can you do it?"

59
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,740
"I did it, so try your luck."

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,930
Even though there's some pudding left,

61
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,810
I don't feel like eating anymore.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,660
I definitely don't want the console to break,

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,550
I can't afford a new one.

64
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,060
I can always take this opportunity

65
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,800
to stop playing Kiwame Quest.

66
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,070
Why are you being so loud?

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,660
This is for you.

68
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,040
Why are you giving me pudding?

69
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,570
I want to play that Full Dive PRG.

70
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,380
You didn't sell it?

71
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,380
I thought about it, but I decided against it.

72
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,730
Why? Isn't that game trash?

73
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,310
Right, it's trash, it's complete trash.

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,620
But…

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,690
You became addicted to Full Dive RPGs

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,570
because you were frustrated with track.

77
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,870
Now you're giving up on them too?

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,500
You're the worst.

79
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,760
At the very least, I want to play until the end of the story.

80
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,160
You came here just to give say these useless things?

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,050
Tomorrow is the start of the school holidays,

82
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,470
so I'm going to play this game non-stop.

83
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,790
I just want to tell you that.

84
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,550
Even if you say that…

85
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,610
Kaede, I'll probably scream tonight too.

86
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,010
Of course, I don't want to scream as well

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,130
but I won't be able to help myself.

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,630
I'll definitely scream.

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,100
What is this? Your "intention to scream declaration"?

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,930
Don't joke around…

91
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,790
Kaede, you're right.

92
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,140
I've been running away

93
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,370
ever since I gave up on track.

94
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,230
Although it might annoy you,

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,370
this is the only thing I haven't given up on halfway.

96
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,560
Please let me play.

97
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,550
What's this nonsense? Just do whatever you want.

98
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,130
I'm really sorry.

99
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,850
Are you ready?

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,880
Yes.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,680
Then let's head out to Gaban's mansion.

102
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,570
Let's go.

103
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,490
I saw it.

104
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,920
Oberdine's Progress, the 0.1% survival rate thing.

105
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,390
That's why I said you should have read

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,940
the walkthrough first, you rash idiot.

107
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,180
There's nothing I can do now, damn it.

108
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,980
First let's try and think of a way to

109
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,830
get you through the goblin attack.

110
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,310
There are still five days left, what's going to happen then?

111
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,370
He said that I might suffer mental problems.

112
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,140
Who knows?

113
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,920
New guards will be lodged at the training house.

114
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,920
Before that, you should go greet Gaban, the ruler of this city.

115
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,720
Alright.

116
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,870
There are sounds of someone being tortured again.

117
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,720
How depressing.

118
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,290
Welcome everyone, I am Gaban, the ruler of this city.

119
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,390
H…hello.

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,010
I thought "Gaban" would be some old guy.

121
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,190
Guards are the treasures of this city.

122
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,260
Please do your best to protect the citizens from goblins,

123
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,200
and take care of yourself, too.

124
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,830
Al…alright.

125
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,880
You are so funny.

126
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,020
What the hell was that?

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,670
I thought it was because a foreign superstar started to dance.

128
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,770
Anyone who got hugged so suddenly would react like that!

129
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,930
Is that so? Maybe I should try next time.

130
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,930
Please stop it.

131
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,860
This is the guard's training grounds.

132
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,890
Today I want to introduce you all to our new teammate,

133
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,690
although he's only with us temporarily,

134
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,300
Hiro will join our team as a mercenary.

135
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,170
Please take care of me.

136
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,880
And two others.

137
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,190
There are other recruits?

138
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,980
These two are Granada and Paru, they're also mercenaries.

139
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,040
Hello everyone.

140
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,020
Hi everyone.

141
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,100
These three are our new recruits, make them feel at home.

142
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,490
-Nice to meet you.
-Do your best!

143
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,200
Thanks to everyone, we were able to

144
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,710
push back the goblins for the time being,

145
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,290
but we don't know when they'll return.

146
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,840
Don't let your guard down and keep training.

147
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,540
Yes, sir.

148
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,100
This time the goblins seem to be

149
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,070
aiming for Lady Gaban's mansion.

150
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,760
Perhaps it's their instinct as monsters.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,580
They think that by capturing that place

152
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,100
they can take over the whole city.

153
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,600
Let's protect the town and Lady Gaban together.

154
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,940
That's our mission as guards of Tedo City.

155
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,340
Hiro, I'm counting on you.

156
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,280
Isn't Tesla the one who is going to train me?

157
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,950
Welcome, I'll show you around your quarters first.

158
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Follow me.

159
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,750
I'm Bob, I joined the guard a month ago.

160
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,870
I don't count as your senior, so please be at ease.

161
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,500
Alright, thanks.

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,280
These guys don't look impressive.

163
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,710
Of course, you're the strongest after all.

164
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,150
You've a lot of vigor, that's how mercenaries should be.

165
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,320
Is this my room?

166
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,010
Why did you go quiet all of a sudden just now?

167
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,510
You were being shown around,

168
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,130
I thought it'd be better not to speak.

169
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,820
I want to let you concentrate on playing Kiwame Quest.

170
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,190
I see, so this is one of Reona's special skills.

171
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,900
Don't look at me like that, I'm a first-rate game advisor.

172
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,110
You really dare to say that?

173
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,870
I need to change my clothes.

174
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,690
Go ahead, I don't mind.

175
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,210
I mind!

176
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,170
Really? It's not like there's much to see.

177
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,330
Did you just say something dirty?

178
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Have you changed?

179
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,350
Yes.

180
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,050
Then let's go back. There are some basic combat training next.

181
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,720
Like fencing?

182
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,520
Yes, and physical training.

183
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,050
Is this where the tutorial starts?

184
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,400
This starts to feel like an RPG.

185
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,760
Don't be so nervous, today's just an introduction.

186
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,520
This…

187
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,160
W-what's wrong?

188
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,620
Hiro, you're pretty thin.

189
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,860
Are you good at sneaking, that kind of thing?

190
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,120
Sneaking? No.

191
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,550
Really? Then just do what you normally do.

192
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,730
Okay.

193
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,530
What's wrong?

194
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,480
Show me some vigor!

195
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,970
It's already started.

196
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,200
Instructor!

197
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,440
The new recruits, Granada, Paru and Hiro.

198
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,130
You are…

199
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,120
So this is the instructor.

200
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,830
I am the instructor at this training ground, Amos.

201
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,830
Obey my orders, or you'll be thrown out.

202
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,030
Especially you!

203
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,450
Me?

204
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,340
Lord Tesla seems to be very fond of you.

205
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Guards speak through their strength,

206
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,370
we don't need any useless good-for-nothings.

207
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,460
Huh…

208
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,750
The correct response is, "yes, sir!"

209
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,290
Remember to salute.

210
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,160
Yes, sir.

211
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,870
Let's get on with it.

212
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,260
So you have also become a guard, Hiro!

213
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,320
I'm Cassie. Actually, when the goblins attacked,

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,210
I was the one who took that little girl home.

215
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,900
I heard that you saved her.

216
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,480
Amos, this bastard. He delegated his job to someone else in the end.

217
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,390
I'm so happy to be fighting alongside a brave guy like you.

218
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a pleasure to meet you.

219
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,970
No, the pleasure's all mine.

220
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,070
You over there! Training has already started!

221
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,690
What? Still sloppy?

222
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,150
Alright, I got it.

223
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,450
Our combat training will start with you, Hiro.

224
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,870
Alright.

225
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,590
It's exactly what I'm hoping for.

226
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,630
Even though I was almost killed by

227
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,890
goblins and my childhood sweetheart,

228
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,620
a fight suing wooden swords should be a piece of cake.

229
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,030
What's wrong? I thought you had more spirit in you.

230
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,850
You can do it, Hiro!

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,960
Let's go eat together after this!

232
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,950
Alright.

233
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,220
What are you playing at?

234
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,590
B-bring it on.

235
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,170
Then, let's do this!

236
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,070
Huh?

237
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,740
He's impressive.

238
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,020
Come on, Hiro!

239
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,400
Hiro, stay calm and look carefully at how he moves.

240
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,370
Let's go, recruit.

241
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,270
Upon closer inspection, he looks just like a civilian.

242
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,400
My hand feels numb.

243
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,230
You're so laid back, I thought you'd be a lot stronger.

244
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,600
You're actually quite weak, aren't you?

245
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,000
He's super weak.

246
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,700
For real? Isn't that guy too weak?

247
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,490
After all, he looks just like a beansprout.

248
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,120
He's weaker than an ordinary citizen, he needs to work out.

249
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,120
Is this what Bob was worried about?

250
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,010
It does feel like everyone else is doing well at training.

251
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,050
Hiro, are you OK?

252
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,750
I didn't expect Amos to be so strong.

253
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,030
Well, he is the instructor.

254
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,650
An average high school kid can't beat him,

255
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,040
this isn't a comic book.

256
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
It's not a comic book, but a game, right?

257
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,090
Seriously?

258
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,370
Is that the level you're at, teacher?

259
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,490
That's the end of training for today.

260
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,090
Ouch.

261
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,350
Can he really call himself an instructor?

262
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,010
That was cool, Granada.

263
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
With an impressive guy like that on our team,

264
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
maybe he can even defeat the goblins.

265
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,330
B…Bob,

266
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,350
now that training is over, want to get something to eat?

267
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,290
Sorry, I have something else I need to do. I'm really sorry.

268
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,010
Hey.

269
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,910
You've been totally cast out.

270
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,870
You don't need to be so harsh about it.

271
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
You really look like a loner, Hiro.

272
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,720
Of course this is what would happen,

273
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,890
if an average high school student became a mercenary.

274
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,360
Why did you join the guards without thinking about it at all?

275
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,760
I thought this was a regular game event.

276
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,240
But it's only for five days, you can wait it out,

277
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,410
and you can try that trick Kamuy taught you.

278
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
That's true.

279
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,510
I'm sure Kamuy would laugh at how my first day turned out.

280
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,600
That's the spirit, Hiro.

281
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,570
After all, you've been ridiculed so many times by now.

282
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,490
Today was exhausting.

283
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,510
Let's sleep until tomorrow.

284
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,690
Can you sleep in this game?

285
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,760
Haven't you played a Full Dive RPG before?

286
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,770
It's not rare to sleep in games.

287
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,720
You're right.

288
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,030
Maybe you're lonely? Would you like me to sleep with you?

289
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,860
That's alright.

290
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,450
Too bad.

291
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,890
Sleep with me?

292
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,490
What will she do if I say yes?

293
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
That's fast!

294
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,000
DAY TWO

295
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,920
Hiro, wake up. It's morning.

296
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,000
Good morning.

297
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,440
Even this "just-woken-up feeling" is realistic.

298
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,140
They made it using the most advanced

299
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,160
neurological technology available.

300
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,650
It gives you the illusion of having had a long night's sleep.

301
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,250
What a waste of technological resources.

302
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,330
More importantly, it seems like everyone

303
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,070
has already gone to the training ground.

304
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,940
What? Why didn't you tell me sooner?

305
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,250
Sorry, I'm late.

306
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,110
Granada really has talent. Yeah, that's it.

307
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,460
Just keep on like that.

308
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,220
That Amos, he's fawning all over him.

309
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,680
What? You're here?

310
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,440
Of course I'm here.

311
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,940
Hiro, although he's an annoying NPC,

312
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,610
he's the instructor, you shouldn't be rude to him.

313
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,090
Alright.

314
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,200
Instructor Amos, what should I do?

315
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,000
Just wave your sword around.

316
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,330
Wave my sword around? If I continue to do it, will I learn a skill?

317
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,910
How is that possible? Are you still three years old?

318
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,990
But Tesla can use powerful skills.

319
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,780
How can an ordinary guy like you compare to Tesla?

320
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,280
Seriously Lord Tesla, why did you bring in such a newbie…

321
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,740
Please teach me. I'll train hard.

322
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,720
Hey, do you really think you

323
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,720
just need to train a little to get strong?

324
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,900
If that's the case, then we've wasted our time

325
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,770
training all these years.

326
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,000
You have a point.

327
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,970
And no matter how hard you train, it won't change the fact

328
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,010
that you have no talent.

329
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,470
It's just like learning to be a dancer when you're eighty years old.

330
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,100
In another word, it's useless, isn't it?

331
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,230
Don't treat me like an old man. I'm the game's protagonist!

332
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,170
He's right, just swing your sword like he said.

333
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,140
I know.

334
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,500
You know? That guy killed his best friend.

335
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,980
Really? They let a guy like him become a guard?

336
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,930
Won't he betray us too?

337
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,770
Hey, that's all over now.

338
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,060
Tesla has also agreed that it was an accident.

339
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,660
Stop bullshitting.

340
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,700
One bad apple spoils

341
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,330
the whole barrel, you know?

342
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,630
Even if you say so…

343
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,170
Hiro, why don't we train together?

344
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,490
Thanks.

345
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,390
He's really pathetic.

346
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,750
What's wrong? You're not training?

347
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,780
No, let's train, please.

348
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,140
You have a friend here! That's reassuring.

349
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah.

350
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,270
I'm so tired. I'm hungry.

351
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,510
What are we eating today? I bet it's bread again.

352
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,720
You need to put some force onto your little finger,

353
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,280
ring finger and middle finger.

354
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,000
Just put your index finger and your thumb on top.

355
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,060
Okay.

356
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,030
Bend your right elbow a little,

357
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,960
then use your left elbow to support it and adjust your posture.

358
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,190
Like this?

359
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,930
Right, not bad!

360
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,810
"Like this?"

361
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,260
Rest time is over, you over there, get moving.

362
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,270
Except for you, Granada, you can keep resting.

363
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,200
Thanks to Cassie, I can finally train normally.

364
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,270
(DAY THREE)
From today onward, we're learning actual combat techniques.

365
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,940
This is awful.

366
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,300
Let's start our actual combat training, begin sparring.

367
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,930
Now!

368
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,070
No way, this is already far beyond the scope of training.

369
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,220
If he hits me,

370
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,580
my body will be broken before the goblins even attack.

371
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,450
What's wrong, Hiro?

372
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,640
Grasp… grasp it harder with this finger,

373
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,490
put the rest of the fingers on top.

374
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,020
The right wrist needs to… How did that go? Damn.

375
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,770
In that case,

376
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,680
I can only give it my best shot.

377
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,630
What's this harmless attack of yours?

378
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,490
Sparring over, Granada is the winner.

379
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,770
Well done, Granada.

380
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,610
You should quit being a soldier.

381
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,520
You won't be of any use even if you stayed.

382
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,500
If you don't want to leave, then you'll have to pay us every day.

383
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,630
Right, that's the only way we'll let you stay.

384
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,180
What? It's like this even in a game?

385
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,930
