00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:18,940
In the 21st century, many VRMMO companies create all kinds of VR worlds.

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,320
From Otherworld to Underground People.
Under the situation of all kinds of worlds coming out,

3
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,420
an old-brand game company launches an innovative game.

4
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,870
It features ultra-high-speed universal artificial intelligence "Al Abo",

5
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,640
NPC which is exactly like the real human,

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,240
an open-ended script system which is said to have
10 to the power of 52 options

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,240
and reproduction of five senses that no VRMMO could do it before.

8
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,600
This game which pursues realism to its extreme has been widely praised.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,750
But a game should be like a game.

10
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,790
People play games to relax.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,700
They don't want too realistic worries.

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,730
So, people come to a conclusion.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,390
That highly-developed VRMMO is not fun.

14
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,600
Therefore, all companies return to traditional systems.

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,450
And VRMMO has lost its popularity at peak time.

16
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,430
No use at all.

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,810
And now my energy bar is refilled!

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,730
Now this is a story about the problematic VRMMO which happened
ten years after it was launched.

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,000
Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shitter Than Real Life!

20
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,450
#01 VR x Reality

21
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,920
Sorry, I haven't decided.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,390
Senior two is coming to an end. I hope you can decide quickly
whether you want to continue to study or find a job.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,170
I've long wanted to talk to you.

24
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,270
About the competition in Senior One.

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,930
Well, that…

26
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,870
You couldn't move on if we don't get everything out in the open.

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,780
You can't decide your future because of that, right?

28
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,560
Yuki, don't worry.

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,710
Turn pain into power and move on!

30
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,210
Do you have to be so ardent?

31
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,120
Didn't he just read the title of the book? You're deeply affected.
(Turn pain into power and move on)

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,780
Distressed? Sad?

33
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,690
If I were you, I would have been self-abandoned and stayed home.

34
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,370
But you're good!

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,090
You didn't stay home, but study hard!

36
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,750
Is he making fun of me?

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,270
That was a miserable memory.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,120
I've been a teacher for so long, but that…

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,060
Teacher, please stop.

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,520
I hope you can accept the past.

41
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,920
If you can't accept it, then let me accept it!

42
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,820
Although I don't know how to solve it,

43
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,370
I'll accept it anyway, like this!

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,030
Anyway, Yuki, turn power into pain and move on!

45
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,620
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

46
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,190
Is that guy a fool?

47
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,160
Hiro.

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,650
Takafumi.

49
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,090
How is your future plan interview?

50
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,050
No help at all. I'm going home to play games.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,120
It's okay to play games, but shouldn't we also exercise more?

52
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,160
Why don't you go to the gym with me?

53
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,750
Forget it. It's no use exercising now.

54
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,620
But you use games to escape…

55
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,830
The big competition is coming soon, right? Go for it!

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,800
Yes, it's been almost two years since…

57
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,620
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,780
It's okay.

59
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,500
Goodbye then.

60
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,150
The reality is really depressing.

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,880
Oh, isn't that Hiro?

62
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,660
Tanishiro, Mishika.

63
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,360
I didn't expect to meet you here. Is that destiny?

64
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,910
Well, there's nothing I can do with you.

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,330
I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,700
That's you, my good boy.

67
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,120
I'll sure give it back to you sooner or later. Maybe later.

68
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,570
If there's anyone in the school you're upset with, let us know.

69
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,350
We'll fix him for you!

70
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,110
That person is right in front of me.

71
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,310
Okay, thank you.

72
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,580
Thanks for… Well, you're welcome.

73
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,690
See you.

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,190
So depressing.

75
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,020
Forget it. After all, today is the day!

76
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,250
I have an appointment for FIQUE.

77
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,350
My long-awaited new VRMMO "FINALIZING QUEST".

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,130
The launch day of FIQUE for short.

79
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,430
It's 13 thousand yen.

80
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,260
Okay.

81
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,810
Still a thousand yen short? I've prepared the money…

82
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,410
Did I give them 10 thousand yen?

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm short of a thousand yen.

84
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,830
Is it?

85
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,550
I can't buy it with this money, right?

86
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,110
No, you couldn't.

87
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,620
Yeah.

88
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,250
The store I made an appointment with
is the cheapest one I've found on the Internet.

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,160
It's unlikely that there will be another store cheaper than this one.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,950
Game Store Kisaragi

91
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,720
Impossible, impossible, impossible.

92
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,380
New VRMMO arrived!!

93
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,850
Really?

94
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,940
Didn't it come out three years ago?

95
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,020
That's right. How could such a store has it?

96
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,040
Hello, I'd like to ask…

97
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,250
Hello, please.

98
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,200
Do you have FIQUE22 which was released today?

99
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,790
FIQUE 22?

100
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,140
The 22nd FINALIZING QUEST.

101
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,600
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

102
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,430
22nd? How many versions of this game will be produced?

103
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,520
It's still the 21st century.

104
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,570
But this game is already in its 22nd version.

105
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,930
It's more than human's century. It's almost time to change its name.

106
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,040
So, do you have it in your store?

107
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,770
By the way, that FIQUE.

108
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,690
You're just used to buying it, aren't you?

109
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,270
It's like comics. It was fun at first, so you started collecting.

110
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,740
But it becomes boring later.

111
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,640
But you've already bought 20 versions.

112
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,140
It would be a pity if you give up halfway.

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,500
So, I'll just buy the next volume. What is it?

114
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,420
It's true…

115
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,800
The fun of playing FIQUE for the first time in primary school

116
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,020
has gradually disappeared as the following versions in the series come out.

117
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,120
The new game that can surpass my expectation is still… Wait, wait, wait!

118
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,870
Why should I be scolded by you, a shop assistant?

119
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,950
But it's true.

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,390
Anyway, I just want to know if you have FIQUE in your store?

121
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
It's not a big problem.

122
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,020
Why isn't it?

123
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,500
If you don't have it, I'll leave.

124
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,870
Please wait.

125
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,360
I have it.

126
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,250
Really?

127
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,470
Of course.

128
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,240
How much?

129
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,190
Ten thousand yen.

130
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,500
Just ten thousand yen?

131
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,120
Yes, you want it?

132
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,920
Yes! If it's ten thousand yen!

133
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,140
Money, please.

134
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,480
Please wait, it should be here.

135
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,870
Here.

136
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,340
Then I pay with this cash.

137
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,230
Thanks for coming!

138
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,420
That's right! This is it!

139
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,770
This is not FIQUE!

140
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,160
Well, please return my money.

141
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,750
Just play this one. It's more interesting than some FIQUE.

142
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,340
It's a super-orthodox Full Dive RPG that pursues realism to its extreme.

143
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I won't play it.

144
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,140
Anyway, just give my money back!

145
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,800
, this game can be summed up in one sentence.

146
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,370
A Full Dive RPG for adults.

147
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,500
For adults?

148
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,150
Look here.

149
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,870
ZZ level?

150
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,570
Is there a level higher than Z?

151
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,450
But I'm only 17.

152
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,070
This ZZ means that it's "recommended" for people over 20 years old.

153
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,800
It's not that you can't play under 20.

154
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,270
But I still want to play FIQUE.

155
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,840
Is it fun to play that healthy game?

156
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,650
Don't you want to experience something more exciting?

157
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,190
Wait?

158
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,550
My name is Reona Kisaragi. Just call me Reona.

159
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,300
And you?

160
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,450
My name is Hiroshi Yuki.

161
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,260
Hiro, I often play this game, too.

162
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,490
I will teach you all kinds of skills in the future with all my heart.

163
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,500
Suddenly I got a beauty's number.

164
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,070
What the hell am I doing?

165
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,390
I was seduced into buying this!

166
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,500
What?!

167
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,410
Isn't it a game of ten years ago?

168
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,960
The number you dialed is busy now. Please leave a message after the beep.

169
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,370
Damn it!

170
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,530
Ten thousand yen?

171
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,130
I'm back.

172
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,010
What a day!

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,780
Kaede.

174
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,710
Sorry! I didn't mean to! It was an accident!

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,250
How long are you gonna keep the door open? You pervert!

176
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,480
So depressing.

177
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,040
Basically, this VR·NX could run all VR games.

178
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,510
Even it's a game of ten years ago. But the problem is…

179
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,700
If it's not fun, I'll return it.

180
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,700
Return it absolutely. Return it anyway.

181
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,050
Brave, defeat the demon, save the world, save Oberdine!

182
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,720
What? She called this super-orthodox Full Dive RPG?

183
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,140
Isn't it common?

184
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,080
Get out of this town and head for Flora City.

185
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,420
This game scans the real body and projects into the game virtually.

186
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,160
It has wind, and…

187
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,240
Hello.

188
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,020
It's a nice day.

189
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,000
As expected, no matter what the game is, the introduction part is exciting.

190
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,660
The touch also feels so real.

191
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,070
This game is awesome!

192
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,200
Hiro, are you there?

193
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,010
The username is the name in the game?

194
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes, I am coming.

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,200
It hurts!

196
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,970
Pain? Does this game even have the sense of pain?

197
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,630
But I never want pain!

198
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,940
Hiro.

199
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
Sorry, Hiro. Did I hurt you?

200
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,000
I am fine.

201
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,650
You didn't open the door for a long time. It's all your fault.

202
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,860
Whether the texture of the skin or the presence of the character.

203
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,380
It's an old game. I didn't expect CG to be so great!

204
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,850
What's up?

205
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,040
No matter how I look at it, the NPC mark just doesn't come out.

206
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,370
Did this game delete the game elements?

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,630
Well, you made me blush.

208
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,170
It's so real that I forget it's a game.

209
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,710
(Do you want to exit the game after saving the adventure progress?)
Great. It's really a world in the game!

210
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,870
I thought I was transferred to an Otherworld.

211
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,700
Hiro, are you ok? Have you been knocked out?

212
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,000
You are?

213
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm Alicia. Alicia.

214
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,570
Your childhood sweetheart.

215
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,510
Childhood sweetheart? A character setting like this?

216
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,530
Didn't you agree to help me pick apples today? Did you forget?

217
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,920
Ah, I remember.

218
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,210
What are you doing, Hiro? Apples are almost ripe.

219
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,920
It looks like a role of a sunny youth.

220
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,980
Sorry, brother. I banged Hiro's head.

221
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,720
What? That's not good.

222
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,390
Leave it to me, Master Martin, your best friend.

223
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,290
Here.

224
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,650
It's the taste of apple. It's real.

225
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,880
Why do you give me an apple?

226
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,300
(Note: An apple a day keeps the doctor away. British idiom)
Isn't there a saying that an apple a day keeps the doctor away?

227
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,150
Isn't that limited to a cold?

228
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,870
How about this year's apple? Not bad?

229
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,240
It's delicious. I didn't expect that this game even has taste.

230
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,660
You look funny when you eat. You'd better cut it before eating.

231
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,510
Here you are.

232
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,170
It's exactly like the real world!

233
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,570
Maybe I've got a masterpiece.

234
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,920
Right! I remember the initial interface.

235
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,670
Get out of this town and head for Flora City.

236
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,360
Right, how can I get to Flora City?

237
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,570
You fool! How can you make such a joke?

238
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,900
Hiro! This joke is not funny at all!

239
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,920
No, I'm not kidding.

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,320
I just want to get out of this town.

241
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,480
You big idiot!

242
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,850
Mind your mouth!

243
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,770
What if the town guards hear you?

244
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,590
Town guards? What's that?

245
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,790
Hiro, stop joking. Let's go to my farm.

246
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,600
What's the matter? Something's wrong.

247
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,520
I'm sorry. I'll pick apples later.

248
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,100
I want to go out of town first.

249
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,520
He is

250
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,990
not all there.

251
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,440
Isn't it common? Just get out of a city in RPG!

252
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,340
Anyway, I'll go first. I'll help you pick apples later.

253
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,910
What kind of adventure is waiting for me? It's exciting!

254
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,090
Hiro!

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,570
Why did you knock me into the air? Aren't you my best friend?

256
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,270
It really hurts!

257
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,030
It's because I'm your best friend that I did it.

258
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,340
How can I watch you flee the town?

259
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,170
Flee the town?

260
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,130
What? Have you lost your memory?

261
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,100
No, I don't think so.

262
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,750
Listen to me carefully.

263
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,290
To protect its people from Goblin's attack,

264
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,730
Tedo City dug huge moats around the city.

265
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,040
The residents were forbidden to go out.

266
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,200
No one can get in here except the special envoy.

267
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,750
The town cut off the communication with the outside world.

268
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,870
Is this going too far?

269
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,870
Will Goblin attack in droves?

270
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,950
I know! That's right! It's just the initial town.

271
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,860
It all starts from this place.

272
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,380
I'll take them down.

273
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,320
Alicia, it seems…

274
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,830
Yeah, he is incurable.

275
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,550
You have gone too far.

276
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,260
In that case, it's up to me to wake you up!

277
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,320
So it's this kind of activity.

278
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,220
As long as I can beat Martin here handsomely,

279
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,450
I can get out of town in a high profile, right?

280
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,970
This is the so-called novice tutorial.

281
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,120
Then I will…

282
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,930
Blood! I bleed! Nosebleed!

283
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,320
Are you a little sober?

284
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,520
It hurts! You idiot! What the hell a good friend?

285
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,840
Besides, I don't know you.

286
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:31,960
What? Did you forget the oath we made under the Kanura tree that day?

287
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,060
What? I don't know that tree with such a weird name!

288
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,790
Hiro!

289
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,040
I said it hurts!

290
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,860
Brother, you can't resort to violence.

291
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,220
It's too late to say that.

292
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,970
I've been beaten like this!

293
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,250
How could you defeat Goblin like this?

294
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,340
Damn it! What's this? What's this!

295
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,270
I've suffered a lot of awful things in the real life.

296
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,190
I didn't expect to be beaten in a game.

297
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,160
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

298
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,660
Are you kidding? You're just a NPC!

299
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,740
I did it! You deserve it!

300
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,810
Martin?

301
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,220
Are you all right?

302
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,110
No!

303
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,920
Brother, brother.

304
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,010
Dead…

305
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,350
It's impossible!

306
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,900
No, he's dead!

307
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,270
Calm down. Do you have any herbs?

308
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,000
I said he died! What's the use of herbs?

309
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,890
That's…right.

310
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,910
Hiro, what are you going to do?

311
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,720
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

312
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,090
Brother is dead. He's dead.

313
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,090
You stabbed him with a dagger. He's dead!

314
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry…

315
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:23,080
Hiro, what are you going to do? Hiro!

316
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,010
I'm sorry!

317
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,480
Don't run! You bastard! Hiro!

318
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,700
Not good, not good, not good! What's going on? What's going on!

319
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,130
Hiro!

320
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,070
What's going on?

321
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,630
Hiro!

322
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,590
Finally, I got rid of her.

323
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,960
I killed a person.

324
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,650
What am I supposed to do?

325
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,630
Wait, that's not right.

326
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,580
Isn't it a game?

327
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,390
That's all right. I just need to restart the game.

328
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,020
Hiro.

329
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm sorry!

330
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,510
Miss Reona?

331
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,320
Sorry I didn't hear your calling. I was taking a bath.

332
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,750
What? Bath?

333
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,280
Not right!

334
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,300
What's up?

335
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,050
Miss Reona, why do you look like this?

336
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,500
This?

337
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,670
This is a special gift for top tasks from the company,
special for shop assistants.

338
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,860
Generally speaking, shouldn't this kind of thing be given to players?

339
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,740
Besides, what kind of dress is this?

340
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,800
It's a fairy. NPC and monsters can neither see me nor hear me.

341
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,480
In other words, a supporter.

342
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,860
Didn't I say I'd teach you with all my heart?

343
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,860
I see.

344
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,970
Have you picked all apples?

345
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,370
Are you taking a walk with your childhood sweetheart?

346
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,000
No, I seem to have made the wrong choice in the beginning.

347
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,950
Did you do something shameful to your childhood sweetheart?

348
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,180
About this…

349
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,090
Wait, let me guess.

350
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,040
So I still wear this.

351
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,420
Didn't this game delete many pictures showing the energy value?

352
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,030
So we need this "Title System" to confirm your game progress.

353
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,730
Title System?

354
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,980
Yes, this necklace records the title that suits you now.

355
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,720
