00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,086
MISSION 26
"IT'S JUST OBON."

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,380
Is everyone ready to go?

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,470
Let's go!

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:17,851
It's hot again today.
It's supposed to get up to 35 degrees!

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,562
Was summer always this hot?

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,188
Compared to ten years ago.

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,150
And then Ms. Aoyama from next door said,

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,778
"That's no way to raise children."

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,363
And everyone got mad.

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,240
The coating is crisp and thin,

11
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,952
and the sweet filling
goes all the way to the tail.

12
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:37,620
But I think…

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,664
Oh, anyone want a salt candy?

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,042
We have to be careful of heatstroke.

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,503
<i>Komi family, business as usual.</i>

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:55,221
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,141
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

18
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,103
<i>Bear in mind,</i>

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,231
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

20
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,693
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,282
You had a nice, long chat.

22
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,035
Did you properly greet your ancestors?

23
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,453
NOD

24
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,133
It's been ages, Mom.

25
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,763
KOMI'S GRANDMOTHER: YUIKO KOMI

26
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,848
Come in.

27
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,685
Look at you. Haven't changed a bit.

28
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,105
Oh my!

29
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,940
Shuko, you're here!

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,901
Hey, Ryoko!

31
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,402
How've you been?

32
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,904
-Great!
-THEY GET ALONG WELL.

33
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,864

00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,824
FATHER: MASAYOSHI

35
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,075
PRESSURE

36
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,285
<i>They get along well.</i>

37
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,912
What?

38
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,289
Is that Shoko?

39
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,668
You get prettier and prettier
every time I see you.

40
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,464
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT
SO SHE NODS.

41
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,924
<i>Adorable.</i>

42
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,760
Oh yes, Shoko.

43
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,055
Akira's here, so could you play with her?

44
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,014
COUSIN: AKIRA
(JUNIOR HIGH YEAR 1)

45
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,893
COUSIN: AKIRA
(JUNIOR HIGH YEAR 1)

46
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,481
She hasn't seen you in so long.

47
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,399
She's feeling shy.

48
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,903
KOMI IS GONE.

49
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,240
RUMBLE

50
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,950
STARTLE!!

51
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,327
DIDN'T MEAN TO STARTLE HER,
AND STARTLED HERSELF MORE.

52
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,622
AFRAID

53
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,625
DOESN'T WANT TO SCARE HER

54
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,960
JUMP

55
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,506
H-Hey, Shoko… Stop that!

56
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,218
TICKLE TICKLE

57
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,388
TWITCH

58
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,182
<i>The emotional distance</i>
<i>between them has shrunk.</i>

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,980
WARMED UP TO KOMI

60
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,731
LIVING ROOM

61
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,483
GARDEN

62
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,609
Shoko.

63
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,069
TOILET

64
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,531
Um, Shoko?

65
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,701
Do you want to play a board game?

66
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,618
NOD

67
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,705
SUDDEN FLOOD OF TEARS

68
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,958
No, I'm alright.

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,211
I'm just so happy you want
to hang out with me.

70
00:04:55,753 --> 00:05:00,008
Until now you always
just sat and looked at me.

71
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,979
-SHOSUKE, HOW HANDSOME! C'MERE!
-KOMI WORKING ON FAMILY BONDING.

72
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,939
-HOME EXPLODES.
-CAT FINDS MONEY! GET 1 MILLION YEN.

73
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,899
Three.

74
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,904
"You have an affair with your young boss.
Get two million yen."

75
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,867
Shoko, go see your grandmother
before dinner.

76
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,077
<i>In the Komi family,</i>

77
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,373
<i>it is customary to keep Grandmother Komi,</i>
<i>the head of the household,</i>

78
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,293
<i>abreast of current going-ons</i>
<i>and seek her wisdom.</i>

79
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,798
LOOKS LIKE GRANDMA SAID SOMETHING STERN.

80
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,675
Come in.

81
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,555
Sit.

82
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,729
Shoko, you're in high school now.

83
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,149
Are you having fun at school?

84
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,237
Is anything worrying or bothering you?

85
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,078
Have you made any friends?

86
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,639
Is that so! That's good.

87
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,113
I'm happy for you.

88
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,202
By the way, have you met anyone special?

89
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,703
What's that reaction?

90
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,247
Show me your phone.

91
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,749
Who is this Hitohito Tadano?!

92
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,459
I don't approve!

93
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,339
-Achoo!
-Did you catch a cold?

94
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,303
MISSION 27
"IT'S JUST A FESTIVAL."

95
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,768
AUGUST 24TH

96
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,439
<i>Tadano!</i>
<i>Let's meet at the festival tonight at six.</i>

97
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,024
-Huh? Today?
-<i>Wear a </i>yukata<i>!</i>

98
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,109
<i>See ya!</i>

99
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,195
<i>So I was told, and here I am.</i>

100
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,034
<i>I feel like I stand out.</i>
<i>Not many people are wearing </i>yukata<i>.</i>

101
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,686
Whoa.

102
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:03,441
-WORRIED THE <i>YUKATA</i> DOESN'T SUIT HER.
-Oh, uh. I mean, you look really nice.

103
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,944
That just slipped out.
Don't worry about it.

104
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,489
<i>Najimi… You could've said Komi was coming.</i>

105
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,532
LOOKS FOR HER NOTEBOOK.

106
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,783
FORGOT HER NOTEBOOK.

107
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,452
Forgot your pen and paper?

108
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,747
Hey!

109
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,166
Thanks for waiting, Tadano and Komi!

110
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,252
It's summer! Summer is here!

111
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,256
What's with the procession?

112
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,969
Huh? Oh, my plans for the festival
were thousand-booked.

113
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,263
<i>Thousand-booked?</i>

114
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,600
But a friend of a friend
is still a friend, right?

115
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,893
Let's go!

116
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,187
<i>What's with the mutant people skills?</i>

117
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,734
Well, I guess we should go too.

118
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,949
What's wrong?

119
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,910
Ta… Ta…

120
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,954
-Ta…
-Hm?

121
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:58,871
Ta…

122
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,208
Ta… Ta… Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta…

123
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>This takes me back.</i>

124
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,463
Oh, anxious because
you don't have your notebook?

125
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
It's alright. I'm here with you.

126
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,761
Oh, uh, I don't mean it in a weird way.

127
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,723
DECIDES NOT TO STRESS.

128
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,028
<i>Hm? Wait a minute…</i>

129
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,656
<i>Komi and I, alone at the festival.</i>

130
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,833
-<i>No, other people are here. Like Najimi!</i>
-BEST NOT TO THINK TOO DEEPLY.

131
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,294
Look, they're doing the Bon dance.

132
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,969
-Let's try target practice!
-FLEES FROM AWKWARDNESS.

133
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,680
<i>Huh? What's wrong with me today?</i>

134
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,765
ANDORO CHOCOLATE

135
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,024
PRESSURE

136
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,067
<i>I can't focus when I'm being watched.</i>

137
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,320
<i>I mean, why am I being watched?</i>

138
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,156
K-Komi, do you want to try?

139
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,125
<i>Hey! So we meet again!</i>

140
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,460
<i>It's Makeru Yadano.</i>

141
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,212
<i>Today I'm competing</i>
<i>at target practice with Komi.</i>

142
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,133
<i>Let's see who can get the most prizes!</i>
<i>It's on, Komi!</i>

143
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,136
TARGET PRACTICE
BEST OF FOUR

144
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,263
<i>You lose!</i>

145
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,015
<i>You lose!</i>

146
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,850
<i>You lose!</i>

147
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,151
It's a tie.

148
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,278
Miss, bring back the gun!

149
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:55,988
Hey!

150
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,532
Komi! Tadano!

151
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,951
Let's play Candy Cutout!

152
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,454
<i>In Candy Cutout,</i>

153
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:08,292
<i>a toothpick is used to cut out</i>
<i>a shape from a flat piece of candy.</i>

154
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:12,380
<i>Successful attempts</i>
<i>may be exchanged for a prize.</i>

155
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,090
Oops.

156
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,636
-HASN'T SUCCEEDED ONCE.
-I'm kinda hooked. This is my 15th try.

157
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,806
You're a gambler in the making.

158
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,496
Ta… Ta… Ta-Ta-Ta… Ta-Ta-Ta…

159
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,914
Ta… Ta… Y-Y-Y-Y…

160
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,083
You're good at this, Komi!

161
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,043
Are you two hungry?

162
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,420
You got bored, didn't you?

163
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,505
I'll go buy something!

164
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,560
<i>Komi has been acting weird all day.</i>

165
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,604
<i>I guess she's not having fun…</i>

166
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,066
<i>I should ask.</i>

167
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,654
-Ta…
-Ko…

168
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,241
Oh, uh, no, you f-first.

169
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,411
Ta…

170
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,248
Ta…

171
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,750
Tadano…

172
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,961
you…

173
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,504
look…

174
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,966
nice… too…

175
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,010
Look nice?

176
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:41,927
Oh!

177
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,053
LOOKS FOR HER NOTEBOOK

178
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,847
FORGOT HER NOTEBOOK

179
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,390
Forgot your pen and paper?

180
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,435
Ta… Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta…

181
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,564
Is that what you've been trying to say
all this time?

182
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,995
<i>He cut out his candy really well.</i>

183
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,332
Look! Look, Tadano.

184
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,833
My tongue is blue!

185
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,792
Yeah. Okay.

186
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,919
Komi!

187
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,046
Sorry for keeping you waiting!

188
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,006
-<i>The usual crowd.</i>
-WASN'T WAITING.

189
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,176
Ko…

190
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,886
-<i>Yuka…ta</i>.
-PROMPTLY FAINTED.

191
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>What's her deal?</i>

192
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,848
Next let's go play the rope lottery!

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:37,816
-Which should I pull?
-<i>I worry for Najimi's future…</i>

194
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,779
<i>The rope lottery. Just pull a rope</i>
<i>and get the attached prize.</i>

195
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,156
<i>It's a simple festival game.</i>

196
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>I definitely want the top prize.</i>

197
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,206
<i>That rope is way older than the rest!</i>

198
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,668
<i>It's the most ragged!</i>

199
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,670
This is it!

200
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,381
POCKET TISSUE

201
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,425
Tadano! Take out the enemy!

202
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,927
I'll pay you.

203
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,844
Huh?

204
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,846
If I must.

205
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,056
Step right up.

206
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,350
Which one should I pull?

207
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,395
Whoooooa!

208
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,983
Whoooooa!

209
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:19,942
Alright, this one.

210
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,443
POCKET TISSUE

211
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,072
Granny, none of these are winners.

212
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,283
That's not true.

213
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,537
Komi, you're our last hope! Please!

214
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,621
HAPPY TO BE RELIED UPON.

215
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,581
<i>Yes.</i>

216
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,542
<i>Of course there are some winners.</i>

217
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,127
<i>This is a business after all.</i>

218
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,881
<i>I've got to play fair.</i>

219
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,591
<i>But you know…</i>

220
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,719
<i>there are strategies, grasshopper!</i>

221
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,429
<i>The old lady's vibe changed!</i>

222
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,140
<i>The rope attached to the PlayStore V!</i>

223
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,975
<i>It looks old and worn.</i>

224
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,143
<i>But that's a fake!</i>

225
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,146
<i>It's switched with a new rope partway.</i>

226
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,731
<i>And facial expressions.</i>

227
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,902
<i>People with no guts don't choose</i>
<i>the ropes that I don't react to.</i>

228
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,029
<i>Well, those are decoys anyway.</i>

229
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,405
<i>It's no use!</i>

230
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,657
<i>Color, aroma, thickness… Many tricks.</i>

231
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,201
<i>The more you think, the tighter the trap!</i>

232
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,620
<i>That's how it's done!</i>

233
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,205
ISN'T THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING.

234
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,707
Yay!

235
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,260
<i>Komi looks beautiful</i>
<i>no matter what she does.</i>

236
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,846
Huh? Nakanaka?

237
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,642
Elegant red servants of the water.

238
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,185
Come to your master.

239
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,103
<i>She's muttering something.</i>

240
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,279
Heh.

241
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,406
Until we meet again.

242
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,241
-KOMI DIDN'T NOTICE.
-NAKANAKA GOT A PITY PRIZE.

243
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,826
Komi!

244
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,162
I finally found you!

245
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,497
Stay where you are.

246
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,165
Could you squat down?

247
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,377
Yes, like that.

248
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,047
I bought a frankfurter!

249
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,174
C'mon, eat my frankfurter!

250
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,134
<i>What's she doing to Komi?!</i>

251
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,845
I'll eat it for you.

252
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,555
MUNCH MUNCH

253
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,101
Something fun's happening over there!
Let's go!

254
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:23,899
GLASS ART

255
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,531
DEAD END!

256
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,448
Komi!

257
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,332
NEAR TEARS

258
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,878
Even if you get lost,
you can just contact me on your phone.

259
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,796
OH YEAH!

260
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,802
I messaged Najimi, so let's wait here.

261
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,181
So many people.

262
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,684
Hm?

263
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,144
YES

264
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,356
I guess you were happy
to meet up with everyone.

265
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,327
IT WAS FUN WITH
JUST THE TWO OF US AS WELL.

266
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,039
Huh?

267
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:20,998
SCRAPE

268
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,000
YES

269
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,585
Hey!

270
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,046
Oh, Najimi and the gang are back.

271
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,761
Komi!

272
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,221
Look, my white chocolate banana.

273
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,890
-Suck…
-Don't say it!

274
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,479
MISSION 28
"IT'S JUST THE END OF SUMMER."

275
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,396
AUGUST 31ST

276
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:53,322
TADANO

277
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,449
Welcome, Komi!

278
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,618
Come in! Don't mind the mess.

279
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,787
Hey, this is my place.

280
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,997
Uh, c'mon in.

281
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,084
<i>K-Komi is in my place…</i>

282
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,630
Komi came over to Tadano's place?

283
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,840
I can't believe it.

284
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,258
<i>Something's here.</i>

285
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,510
Ta-da!

286
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,596
This is Tadano and his sister's room!

287
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,972
Huh.

288
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,642
Hitohito, are these your friends?

289
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,559
Ah.

290
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,436
Oh, hello.

291
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,605
Thanks for always
being nice to my brother.

292
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,941
I'm his little sister, Hitomi Tadano.

293
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,945
We share the room,
so you'll see me around,

294
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,113
but pay me no mind.

295
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,781
THEY'RE SOMEHOW EXCITED.

296
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,909
Long time no see, Hitomi!
It's been what, a year?

297
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,037
Najimi! You've… changed?

298
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,498
I'm Yamai. Thanks for having me.

299
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,791
You're welcome.

300
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,001
<i>Wow, she's so beautiful.</i>

301
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,170
<i>Is she with my brother?</i>

302
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,883
-Hey, Hitohito.
-Huh?

303
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,095
What did you do?

304
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,430
-Huh?
-What did you do?!

305
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,349
Uh…

306
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,564
I have gathered you here today

307
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,275
in order to carry out
an important mission.

308
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,403
To tell the truth…

309
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,323
I haven't finished a single bit
of my summer homework.

310
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,617
<i>Ah, I had a feeling that was it.</i>

311
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,327
Yes! As I was saying.

312
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,664
I must ask you to show me your homework!

313
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,666
Why are you so okay with this?

314
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,710
This happened last year too.

315
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,211
No time management.

316
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,297
-KOMI IS DUMBSTRUCK.
-That's harsh.

317
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,798
What is this?

318
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,594
Let one who has finished their homework
cast the first stone!

319
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,429
Of course I'm done.

320
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,471
Me too.

321
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,974
If I stay up all night, I'll fini--

322
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,475
So typical.

323
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,395
Tadano, you never let me down.

324
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,857
Anyway, you should never copy homework.

325
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,443
Komi, you don't have to share your notes.

326
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,360
Huh?!

327
00:19:55,444 --> 00:20:00,449
Okay, we'll do our homework,
but you guys can just relax.

328
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,575
I'LL STUDY TOO.

329
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,160
Wow, great!

330
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,412
Alright, since I'm here,

331
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,373
I'll just watch Komi.

332
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,558
Summer's over for another year.

333
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,894
That was fast.

334
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,438
Yeah.

335
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,106
We sure had fun!

336
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,235
We didn't do anything
for the first week, though.

337
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,278
First there was the pool.

338
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,948
I went 51 times this year alone!

339
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,784
Huh? Do we even have 51 days of vacation?

340
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,328
Komi fell and scraped her knee.

341
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,205
Is it better now?

342
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:54,044
When Komi fell, Yamai and the others
filed down the spot on the ground.

343
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,588
I have a picture. Do you want to see?

344
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,006
Really? Show me!

345
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,007
Here.

346
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,593
Oh, I saw Komi at the library.

347
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,887
Then later at the park too.

348
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,515
-YOU SHOULD'VE SAID HI.
-Ah, you're right.

349
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,100
I'll do that next time.

350
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,893
We went to the festival too!

351
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,563
That reminds me, Tadano.
What was your Candy Cutout prize?

352
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,275
Oh, I forgot to get it.

353
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,360
Huh? What a waste.

354
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,988
Yamai, did you hang out with Komi?

355
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,905
Huh?

356
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,741
You said the two of you
were going to do something.

357
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,076
Oh, about that…

358
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,079
Oh, I see, you couldn't ask her out.

359
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,219
W-W-W-What's wrong, Komi?

360
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,180
SORRY. I'M FINE.

361
