00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,368
NOD

182
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,912
Yeah! I'm hungry, too.

183
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,414
Want to try the place by the station?

184
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,834
It's so unlike you
to say you want to go somewhere.

185
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,671
-IT'S MY DREAM TO GO TO A RAMEN SHOP.
-<i>You have some odd dreams, Komi.</i>

186
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,759
Are you all going for ramen?

187
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,471
That's my cue.

188
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,972
AGARI IS A RAMEN EXPERT

189
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,099
A-Agari?

190
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,309
RAMEN DARO

191
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,687
Ta-da! I recommend this place, Ramen Daro!

192
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,525
It's famous, isn't it?
Daro-style or something.

193
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,902
-Yeah!
-Will it be okay?

194
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,154
I heard it's greasy and filling.

195
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,072
LET'S GO.

196
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,365
Quick reply!

197
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,827
Yes, it's known for being rich and heavy.

198
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,746
-Too much for most people. Men go alone.
-Agari…?!

199
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,582
Oh! I-I-I'm sorry.

200
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,086
When it comes to food,
I always talk too much.

201
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,629
I-I see…

202
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,007
<i>Oh good, back to the old Agari.</i>

203
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,217
LARGE DOUBLE PORK

204
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,053
Places like this
have special rules, right?

205
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,471
I saw it on TV.

206
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,391
I'll get the same as Agari.

207
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,851
Guilty.

208
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,353
Uh, guil… huh?

209
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,440
<i>Ramen Daro First Commandment…</i>

210
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,442
<i>Thou shalt not talk.</i>

211
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,402
KOMI'S DOING FINE.

212
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,362
<i>Second commandment.</i>

213
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,575
-<i>Thou shalt order promptly and sit.</i>
-I'm s-sorry!

214
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,285
<i>Third commandment.</i>

215
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:28,539
<i>Thou shalt be polite to the boss</i>
<i>and wait calmly.</i>

216
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,000
DOOM

217
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,501
FWIP

218
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,714
<i>So this is the classic</i>
<i>tough-guy ramen boss.</i>

219
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,427
Toppings?

220
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,928
<i>His voice is tiny!</i>

221
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,723
Veggies. Garlic. Lots of lard. Soy sauce.

222
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,640
A hex?

223
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,767
And for the lady?

224
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,352
<i>What will Komi do?</i>

225
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,732
NOD

226
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,400
<i>He got it!</i>

227
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,068
THUD

228
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,236
<i>Wow!</i>

229
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,155
<i>This is a lot.</i>

230
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,948
Let's eat!

231
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,116
GLISTEN

232
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,409
<i>Boss?</i>

233
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,234
Whoa…

234
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,196
<i>Boss?</i>

235
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,698
Wow.

236
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:49,161
WORRIED THAT SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG.

237
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,540
<i>Ramen Daro Fourth Commandment…</i>

238
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,001
<i>Thou shalt clear your bowl</i>
<i>and leave quickly after eating.</i>

239
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,338
Soggy noodles…

240
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,966
Yeah! That was great!

241
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,386
Wasn't that great?

242
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,347
Yeah, but I'm way too full.

243
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,311
LET'S GO AGAIN SOMETIME.

244
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,483
Nah, I think I'm good.

245
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,862
<i>But they started craving it,</i>

246
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,698
<i>and they went again a week later.</i>

247
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,368
MISSION 15
"IT'S JUST A BLOOD PACT."

248
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,328
You didn't see it yesterday?

249
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,496
No, I didn't.

250
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,748
-It was really good.
-Oh yeah?

251
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,126
-You missed out.
-Seriously?

252
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,210
PASS

253
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,006
So there are four types of wrappers
that tell a little story.

254
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,925
Two don't even have
rice crackers in the picture.

255
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,096
Like, why is there an old lady?
They used to be grilled too.

256
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,474
Beetles have average brains,
even though they're mammals.

257
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,934
-COLLAPSE
-SHOCK

258
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,146
W-What can this be?

259
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:02,192
The forbidden power within me,
Dragon Force, is tingling!

260
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,277
But why?

261
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,989
JOLT

262
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,491
Is that you, Princess Komilia?

263
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,577
<i>Princess Komilia?</i>

264
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,038
<i>Nakanaka has a rich fantasy life.</i>

265
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,458
Komi, do you know Nakanaka?

266
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,626
HAS NO IDEA

267
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,337
Princess Komilia, did you forget me?

268
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,546
It's me!

269
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,175
My real name is Marsault Les Primavera!

270
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,092
Real name?

271
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,510
REAL NAME
OMOHARU NAKANAKA

272
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,803
I understand.

273
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:34,808
We have died and been reborn
many times since then, across nations.

274
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,478
-FORMER FANTISIZER.
-<i>Something here feels familiar…</i>

275
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,188
Princess Komilia!

276
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:44,234
If our Dragon Forces are over 10m apart,
it will cause a huge explosion.

277
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,487
And um, the world will be destroyed!

278
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,531
H-Hurry and make a blood pact with me!

279
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,659
It was alright until now though?

280
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,166
TELL ME MORE.

281
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,459
<i>She believed it.</i>

282
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,796
Um, when my Dragon Force tingles,

283
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,465
it, uh, causes a resonance.

284
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,676
WHAT IS THE DRAGON FORCE?

285
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,428
<i>It ruins the effect</i>
<i>when you have to explain.</i>

286
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,515
The premise doesn't matter!

287
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,476
Hurry! We must form a blood pact!

288
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,894
<i>She said "premise."</i>

289
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,398
TREMBLE

290
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,860
My evil eye is out of control!

291
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,070
EVIL EYE = PINKEYE

292
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,991
I've got to go to the nurse's office!

293
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,997
I think blood pact means
she wants to be your friend.

294
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,252
Was Nakanaka always that cringey?

295
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,046
She's like how Tadano used to be.

296
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,382
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

297
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,175
Oh uh.

298
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,011
Hey, Najimi!

299
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,471
Back in junior high…

300
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,725
<i>They call me Hitohito Tadano.</i>

301
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>Second year, junior high.</i>

302
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,602
<i>As you can see,</i>

303
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,188
<i>I'm kind of a big deal.</i>

304
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,773
-POSING
-THINKS HE'S A BIG DEAL

305
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,191
-And then…
-Yeah?

306
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,484
That girl…

307
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,946
<i>That's Kawai, the prettiest girl in class.</i>

308
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,073
Good morning, Tadano!

309
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,244
Najimi. It's on.

310
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,954
What's on?

311
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,416
Operation L. We're doing it.

312
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,876
EVERYTHING'S AN "OPERATION"

313
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,763
<i>The "L" in Operation L is…</i>

314
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,978
H-Hey Kawai.

315
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,398
I think you see how I feel, bruh.

316
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,775
CLASSIC CRINGE #4
"BRUH"

317
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,695
Listen! I've been into you since--

318
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,280
Sorry.

319
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,746
Huh? Why?

320
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,248
You're just kinda cringey.

321
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,084
It's not cool.

322
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,508
<i>I'm never going to play it cool again.</i>

323
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,259
<i>I'll be normal.</i>

324
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,929
<i>Just normal.</i>

325
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,641
<i>I won't make waves.</i>

326
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,103
<i>Tadano's personality was cemented.</i>

327
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,605
Like that.

328
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,150
It's this phase where kids
think they're special.

329
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,780
They have a rich fantasy life.
Tadano, you were so cringey.

330
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,329
Huh? Tadano?

331
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,040
-A part of him died!
-HAUNTED BY THE PAST.

332
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,294
Alright. We'll do
some warmup stretches.

333
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,338
Make groups of two.

334
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,965
Pairs.

335
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,300
Ko…

336
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,761
Komi!

337
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,138
Komi, be my partner!

338
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,682
Pick me, Komi! We're friends, right?

339
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,475
-Komi, me!
-Partner with me!

340
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,686
-Let's do it!
-Uh…

341
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,565
-I'm so stiff today.
-Oh yeah?

342
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,949
Fools, all of them.

343
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,870
They're not of darkness, like me.

344
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,415
I can't blame them.

345
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,293
If any ordinary souls
touched my Dragon Force,

346
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,045
their bodies would melt to the ground.

347
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,097
Why won't anyone…

348
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,850
pair up with me…

349
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,818
You startled me!

350
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,413
You'll stretch with me?

351
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,880
-Aw, lucky.
-I'm jealous!

352
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,382
I wanted to do that.

353
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:22,054
Waah. Why didn't she choose me?

354
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,765
Time for volleyball.

355
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,975
Okay!

356
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,647
Komi!

357
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,902
Um.

358
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,030
I, uh.

359
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,074
Th-Thank…

360
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,083
I tricked you, Princess Komilia!

361
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,127
I'm not your servant,
Marsault Les Whatever.

362
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,673
I'm Lord Malt Trie Vessner,
of the Dark Dragon!

363
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,759
Through our blood pact,
you are now my vassal!

364
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:17,150
Well, I suppose I can pardon you…

365
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,946
<i>Komi made a blood pact with Nakanaka.</i>

366
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,873
CLASS PRESIDENT

367
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,458
CLASS VICE PRESIDENT

368
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,223
I WAS READING IN THE LIBRARY
AND NOW LOOK AT THE TIME.

369
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,644
NOD

370
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,903
TADANO, I HAVE YOUR UMBRELLA.
SIGNED, A THIEF NAMED "N".

371
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,096
GRAZE

372
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,795
Once exams are over it'll be summer break.

373
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,340
We got so much homework.
It's going to be tough.

374
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,512
What's wrong, Komi?

375
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,018
I bought an umbrella.

376
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,686
Oh, here's a towel.

377
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,231
It was a three-pack. Have one.

378
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,493
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

379
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:36,540
Did you read that note from Najimi
and wait for me by the shoe lockers?

380
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,970
<i>The sun came out.</i>

381
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,847
