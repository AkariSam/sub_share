00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,669
MISSION 33
"IT'S JUST SPORTS DAY."

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:06,005
<i>Testing. Mic test 1-2-3.</i>

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,719
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,304
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>Bear in mind,</i>

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,143
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>I hereby declare the opening of</i>
<i>the 23rd Itan High School Sports Day!</i>

9
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,701
Victory to our god!

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,702
YEAAAAAH

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,953
-STARTLE
-KOMI'S CLASS

12
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,837
It's sports day!

13
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,338
Wow, you startled me!

14
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,258
Tadano, Komi! Sports Day is a festival!

15
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,218
Let's get more hyped!

16
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,805
You're just happy because
you don't have to study.

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,642
39.2 degrees. Hm.

18
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,437
Temperature's rising, Najimi.

19
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,774
<i>Netsuno is hot-blooded.</i>

20
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,442
-<i>Wh-Who?</i>
-A NEW CHARACTER?

21
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,736
That's Netsuno!

22
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,573
So you're Komi!

23
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm Chika Netsuno from second year.
Nice to meet you.

24
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,953
FREAKED OUT BY THE CLOSENESS.

25
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:47,166
Your class is 41.5 degrees.
Getting pretty hot.

26
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,878
Compared to that…

27
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,338
You're very cool.

28
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,716
16.9 degrees. Pretty chilly.

29
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,301
<i>Chilly?</i>

30
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,724
I hope you won't hold your class back.

31
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
What was that?

32
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,313
WHAP WHAP

33
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,939
What's up with that woman?

34
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,901
She just touched Komi.
Someone's playing with fire.

35
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,362
Everyone! It's a fight to the death!

36
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,573
YEAH!

37
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,909
Let's just do our best.

38
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,288
Now, the rules of the sports festival.

39
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,751
It's a round-robin tournament
with all classes from first to third year.

40
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,755
Get points for your team
by winning events!

41
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,758
The class with the most points wins!

42
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,718
I'm your MC, Tsukasa Aizawa.

43
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,179
And our special judge is…

44
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,347
Vice-principal here.

45
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,308
Now, the first game is…

46
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,686
Group Exercises!

47
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,522
The person with the most beautiful form

48
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,651
will earn 10 points for their class
from the vice-principal!

49
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,737
Radio Exercise Number 1! Ready?

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,072
<i>Impressive!</i>

51
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,449
<i>Netsuno from second year.</i>

52
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,577
<i>Big, eye-catching gestures as always!</i>

53
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,706
<i>There is awareness</i>
<i>in every single fingertip.</i>

54
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,417
<i>Ah, a lovely spread.</i>

55
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,754
<i>Hmm, there are other good ones,</i>

56
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,340
<i>but perhaps Netsuno's the best…</i>

57
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,802
<i>W-Wait!</i>

58
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,178
BAM

59
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,722
I changed my mind. 10 points to Komi!

60
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,640
What?

61
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,351
Moving on to the second game!

62
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,231
Tug-of-War Class Tournament!

63
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,195
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

64
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,157
Heave-ho! Ko-mi! Ko-mi!

65
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,119
Oh, Komi…

66
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,122
If you push me any harder I'm…

67
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,083
-Komi's beside me…
-Komi's right behind me…

68
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,920
<i>Several people went weak,</i>
<i>so they lost in the first round.</i>

69
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,341
Obstacle Relay!

70
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,262
This game also has points for artistry!

71
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>Oh… I'm slow, so I have to work hard.</i>

72
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,937
<i>For Komi!</i>

73
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,897
Oh! Agari from Class 1-1!

74
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,858
Off to a slow start!

75
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,777
But wait!

76
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,780
She got lots of points for artistry!

77
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,034
I can hear the boys sighing!

78
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,870
Can Class 1-1 catch up?

79
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,707
<i>Why do I have to be on display like this?</i>

80
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,835
<i>First of all, Sports Day is a joke.</i>

81
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,380
<i>Is an event that mocks</i>
<i>the athletically-challenged</i>

82
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,215
<i>even needed in a hall of learning?</i>

83
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,134
<i>No! Definitely not!</i>

84
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,846
<i>I'll just fumble through</i>
<i>and get it over w… Oh!</i>

85
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,639
<i>What's this?</i>

86
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,809
<i>Searching for candy in</i>
<i>a bin of starch with no hands!</i>

87
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,772
<i>This is designed</i>
<i>to make people look foolish!</i>

88
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,740
GULP

89
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,825
<i>Fine. I'll use my Dragon Force</i>

90
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>to expertly extract a piece of candy</i>
<i>from this sea of starch!</i>

91
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,127
Now on to the next runner!

92
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,215
They're currently in last place!
Will they be able to turn it around?

93
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,174
Run! Tadano!

94
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,551
Do it or I'll bury you!

95
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,431
What's wrong?

96
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:35,561
Hey! C'mon and cheer with us!

97
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,028
Go! Go! Tadano!

98
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,490
TADANO GOT DIZZY FROM SPINNING

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,200
Huh?

100
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:59,210
You… can… do…

101
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,211
it!

102
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,846
-<i>They came in third.</i>
-(OUT OF 5)

103
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,437
52.4 degrees. You were on fire!

104
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,604
Huh?

105
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,857
<i>On to the second half!</i>

106
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,528
A flash rainstorm!

107
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,783
It suddenly started raining.

108
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,453
Hopefully it stops soon.

109
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,912
SPARKLE

110
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,874
<i>Komi's speaking!</i>

111
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,419
Hello. I'm Shoko's mom, Shuko.

112
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,256
Thanks for being so nice to Shoko!

113
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,177
Yeah! Shuko!

114
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,347
Huh? What's wrong?
I've come all this way to cheer for you.

115
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,811
They're all nice kids.

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,491
Alright everyone,
give it your all in the second half!

117
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,951
Yeah!

00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,705
Class Competition Borrowing Race!

119
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,541
-Ta-Ta-Tadano!
-Hm?

120
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,293
Can I borrow your jacket?

121
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,753
Sure!

122
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,463
Tadano.

123
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,964
Lend me your hair!

124
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,426
-Huh? If I lend it, it won't come back.
-I GUESS IT'S OKAY…

125
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,391
-POINTS.
-My headband?

126
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,351
-CORRECT!
-BORROW A HEADBAND.

127
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,311
Tadano!

128
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,813
Lend me a shoe,
and a thousand yen.

129
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,898
Nothing for you!

130
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,859
Schoolwide Musical Chairs!

131
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,819
Once 100 chairs are left,

132
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,782
the remaining students
will be awarded points for their class!

133
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,078

We're into the final game of the day!

You can't miss a second!

141

The final competition is!

142
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,641
Class Relay!

143
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:24,564
Each class will choose four runners,
and the first-place winner

144
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,191
will get a hundred million points!

145
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,277
<i>They always do that on TV variety shows!</i>

146
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,488
There's a chance for every class!

147
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,296
I never thought we'd meet like this.

148
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,213
Cheers.

MISSED OPPORTUNITY

152
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,388
You're chilly like I thought.

153
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,850
I don't think I'll lose.

154
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,312
Is Komi going to be okay?

155
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,232
STAMPEDE

156
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,276
67.3 degrees!

157
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:14,488
Classes 1-1 and 2-3
got their batons at the same moment!

158
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,491
<i>I thought you were chilly,</i>

159
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>but you really bring the heat!</i>

160
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,788
<i>Alright, I'll show you what I can do.</i>

161
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,303

00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,268
Komi!

163
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,729
Go, Komi!

Sorry I said you were chilly.

You gave 120 degrees out there!

170
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,154
You're blazing hot, Komi!

171
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,491
See you next year.

172
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,243
Komi! Komi!

173
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,286
A-Are you okay?

174
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,413
Are you injured?

175
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,208
Are you alright? It doesn't hurt?
We were worried!

176
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,504
They're more concerned
about her injuries than losing.

177
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,048
BLUBBER

178
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,675

-Komi's shaking!
-She must be so upset about losing!

182
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,943
SHAKING BECAUSE
EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT HER

183
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,946
<i>For a lot of people with social anxiety,</i>

184
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,534
<i>when their friends talk</i>
<i>to someone they don't know,</i>

185
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,372
<i>they tend to not be able to join in.</i>

186
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,375
<i>And this feeling,</i>

187
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,380
<i>might be called "jealousy."</i>

188
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,430
<i>I feel eyes on me.</i>

189
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,813
Tadano, get the papers
from the prep room!

190
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,399
Tadano, about the culture festival.

191
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,736
Hey! When will that hidden camera
for filming Komi arrive?

192
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,530
Hey Tadano, about forming
the Komi Bodyguards.

193
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,948
The ball is in your court.

194
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,825
<i>What's the Komi Bodyguards?</i>

195
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,286
GLOOM

196
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,121
VICE-PRESIDENT
CLASS PRESIDENT

197
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,707
-Hold up!
-Gurk!

198
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,960
Um, uh.

199
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,670
Onemine?

200
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,922
-Hi!
-Let me go…

201
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,258
You're so busy with class council stuff.

202
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,593
Are you okay?

203
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,846
Oh. Did you want
to ask me to do something?

204
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,265
No, no, I came to help out!

205
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,726
W-What do you want from me?

206
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,978
You're really suffering, hey Tadano.

207
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,272
-Can I take this for you?
-Huh?

208
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,775
Seriously, they're asking too much of you.

209
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,194
Najimi, get the papers from the prep room.

210
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,530
There's no standing up to you, Onemine!

211
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,156
-Right now!
-Alright!

212
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,576
-WANTS TO HELP
-Komi, will you help too?

213
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,997
Hm? The two of us can handle it.

214
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,750
Oh. I guess you're right.

215
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,794
Alright Komi. See you tomorrow.

216
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,591
Tadano, how are things?

217
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,176
Huh? What do you mean?

218
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,094
You know…

219
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,138
You're being bullied, aren't you?

220
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,725
Uh, no, I don't think so…

221
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,270
Really? But the teacher said…

222
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,187
STAFF ROOM

223
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,023
I can just make Tadano do it. Life's good!

224
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,485
…as she was playing a game,
so I thought…

225
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>Huh? Maybe I am being bullied.</i>

226
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,534
So you were concerned and offered to help?

227
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,327
You guessed?

228
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,539
I just can't mind my own business.
Always been that way.

229
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,999
<i>Such a good person!</i>

230
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,083
SCIENCE LAB

231
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,835
Also, can I ask?

232
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,752
Sure.

233
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,129
Are you…

234
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,797
a masochist?

235
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,593
Um, could you tell me how you
reached that conclusion?

236
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,264
After all, Komi is so beautiful
and hard to approach.

237
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,558
-Isn't it a lot of pressure?
-Huh?

238
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,059
Is it?

239
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,562
So for someone like you, an avera…

240
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,024
a normal guy like you
to always be with her…

241
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,943
I guess you must be into pain.

242
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,405
Oh, don't worry. I totally get it!

243
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,407
It's not like that at all.

244
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,328
I don't feel any pressure being with Komi.

245
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,081
You'll understand if you talk to her.
I think she'd like that.

246
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,625
Really?

247
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,378
But everyone puts her on such a pedestal.

248
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,048
She must look down on…

249
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,841
She really doesn't.

250
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,887
Huh.

251
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,851
Anyway, if you're ever having trouble,
you can talk to me.

252
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,686
Thank you!

253
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,691
Huh? Komi? What's wrong?

254
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,569
STARE

255
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,615
<i>You'll understand if you talk to her.</i>
<i>I think she'd like that.</i>

256
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,993
H-Hi there, Komi…

257
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,244
-Huh?
-Oh!

258
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,705
Um, oh, that's just, uh.

259
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,167
How can I explain? Hmm.

260
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,128
-AFTER SCHOOL.
-Bye! See ya!

261
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,171
GLOOM

262
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,840
They gave you work again?

263
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,219
I guess I'll help you.

264
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,553
Oh, uh, no. That's…

265
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,099
If you say no,
I'll just make more work for you!

266
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,517
<i>Such a good person!</i>

267
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,729
-Komi, you can go on home.
-IT'D BE BAD TO MAKE HER WAIT…

268
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,569
One, two, three, four, five, six, ten.

269
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,656
Let's make quick work of this.

270
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,865
Alright!

271
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,161
This is for the culture festival…

272
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,456
And this is for the teacher.

273
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,749
Got it.

274
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,131
I WANT TO HELP, TOO.

275
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:53,345
Ah, alright. Please do. It'll help a lot.

276
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,808
Why are you so eager to help?

277
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:02,396
Ah, so for this document here,

278
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,026
I want to tally up A, B, and C,
so if you can circle this…

279
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,318
Sorry!

280
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,571
I had plans today.

281
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,407
I gotta go! Really sorry!

282
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,079
Bye, you two.

283
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,251
Huh?

284
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,212
THE NEXT DAY

285
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,595
Hey you two!

286
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,432
Was that a little too buddy-buddy?

287
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,021
SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.
YOU SPOKE TO ME BUT I RAN AWAY.

288
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,984
GOOD MORNING.

289
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,990
Sorry, that just tickled me.

290
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,159
Ah, Komi.

291
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,704
Sorry I was hanging out
with Tadano yesterday.

292
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,373
I'm rooting for the two of you.

293
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,173
Uh, Komi?

294
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,634
What did you say to her?

295
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,551
Huh?

296
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,473
That's between me and Komi.

297
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,268
DID YOU SEE IT?

298
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,396
IT SEEMS THAT PHOTO STICKERS
ARE POPULAR THESE DAYS.

299
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,731
Yes, I guess so.

300
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,943
-I WAS THINKING IT SEEMS FUN…
-Yeah.

301
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,032
Do you want to go?

302
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,409
I heard that!

303
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,328
You?

304
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,831
Have no fear, Photogenic Najimi is here!

305
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,041
Huh? What? Say that again.

306
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,418
We can go to the arcade by the station.

307
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,255
What? You're going to take photo stickers?

308
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,132
Without me?

309
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,633
It's…

310
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,301
Filter Queen Yamai!

311
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,220
What's this bit you're doing?

312
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,681
It's been ages.

313
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,600
I used to take a lot in junior high.

314
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,185
Yeah.

315
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,645
Komi?

316
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,363
SPARKLE

317
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,283
There are a lot of different types.

318
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,826
Hey! We're starting!

319
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,912
<i>Choose a frame.</i>

320
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,164
Is this one okay?

321
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>Which filter will you use?</i>

322
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,750
<i>Beautiful skin mode.</i>

323
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,421
Komi, you already have nice skin,
so you'd just disappear.

324
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,798
<i>Big clear eyes mode.</i>

325
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:39,636
Komi already has big eyes,
so you'd just look like an alien.

326
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,097
<i>Full-body long-legged model mode.</i>

327
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,185
Komi already has long legs,
so you'd just look weird.

328
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,519
Huh?

329
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,855
<i>There's no filter we can use for Komi!</i>

330
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,442
<i>First, a cute one. Smile big!</i>

331
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,904
-<i>Now make a cute angry pose.</i>
-EMBARRASSED

332
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,699
<i>Last, do some funny faces together!</i>

333
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,659
FRIENDS FOREVER!

334
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,582
-They're awful! Ha ha ha!
-IS IT OKAY TO LAUGH?

335
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,543
Adorable!

336
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,755
I laughed so hard I'm hungry now.

337
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,256
Let's get a snack!

338
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,299
Yeah.

339
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,639
THANKS EVERYONE.

340
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,527
Komi?

341
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,330
THREE DAYS LATER

342
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,292
Good morning, Komi.

343
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,585
GOOD MORNING.

344
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,836
Hang on.

345
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,258
Here.

346
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,222
When we went to the arcade,

347
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,307
you were looking at it.

348
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,811
I figured maybe you wanted one.

349
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,647
I just happened to get it
on the first try.

350
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,358
It's not like…
It's okay if you don't want it.

351
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,776
WAVE WAVE

352
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,618
AFTER THAT, I GOT NAJIMI TO TAKE ME.

353
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,329
Oh, is that what happened?

354
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,583
Then I guess you don't need…

355
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,793
Komi?

356
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,090
LET'S TRADE.

357
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,638
Here.

358
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,768
Morning!

359
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,521
Huh? What's up?

360
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,814
Hey! What's going on?

361
