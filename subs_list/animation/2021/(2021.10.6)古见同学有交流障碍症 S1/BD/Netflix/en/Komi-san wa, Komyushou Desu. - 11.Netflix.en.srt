<i>Class 1-1.</i>

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:07,090
<i>They were in the midst of</i>
<i>an unprecedented crisis.</i>

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,552
<i>The atmosphere was tense,</i>
<i>on the verge of collapse.</i>

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,678
Komi! Komi!

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,762
<i>Curses flew through the air.</i>

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,722
HUH?

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>The delinquents from</i>
<i>episode three appeared.</i>

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,518
<i>The class is now…</i>

9
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,770
That's why I think Komi should…!

10
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,147
I'm Komi's…!

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,107
-I want Komi to…!
-Komi! Komi!

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,317
Um, ah, hey everyone.

13
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,029
<i>…deciding what to do</i>
<i>for the culture festival.</i>

14
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:29,946
Alright.

15
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,163
Okay, I got it!

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,374
Just stop!

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,087
We voted and amazingly, it was a tie.

18
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,466
Let's all hear one last pitch
for each choice,

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,426
and vote one more time!

20
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,387
And for better or worse,

21
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,139
that'll be our choice!

22
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,391
That's what you want to say,
right Tadano?

23
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,893
Huh? Uh… Alright, let's do that.

NAJIMI'S PROPOSAL

25
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,106
Above all,
I think we should do a maid cafe.

26
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,694
It may be overdone and old. But listen.

27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,614
You want to see it, don't you?
Komi in a maid outfit.

28
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,576
<i>Of course we do!</i>

29
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,119
Me next.

30
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,955
-YAMAI'S PROPOSAL
-I propose a haunted house.

31
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,416
It is a lot of work and money.

32
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,628
But that's just the kind of thing
that would bring us together, right?

33
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,589
And in a darkened room,

34
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,508
we could get away with
touching Komi's butt.

35
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,677
<i>You have a point!</i>

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,720
That's not okay!

37
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,806
-NAKANAKA'S PROPOSAL
-I think we should make a band.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,475
I know not many people would be featured,

39
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,811
but some don't want to be
in the spotlight.

40
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,979
Anyway…

41
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,899
Don't you want to hear
the voice of our god?

42
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,276

00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,409

49
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,544
-THE KOMI BODYGUARDS
-Wait. It's gotta be a medieval story.

50
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,504
Ninjas are nonsense!

51
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,298
We don't have the budget.

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,092
-ONEMINE'S PROPOSAL
-I think we should sell rice balls.

53

Everyone needs a snack, right?

54
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,848
And I'm good at making rice balls.

55
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,893
-A rice ball made by our god!
-Huh?

56
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,978

Oh, by the way.

79

What did you vote for?

80
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,625
KOMI! KOMI!

81
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,713
I mean,
only if you're comfortable telling me.

82
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,057
I CHOSE THE MAID CAFE.

83
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,184
Huh? Oh!

00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,146
The maid cafe?

85
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,981

00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,254
Someone take out the garbage.

93
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,673
I have to carry this. Move the desks!

94
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,592
KOMI WANTS TO HELP BUT CAN'T.

95
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,428
Hey, someone hold that end!

96
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,390
OKAY!

97
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,975
Anyone!

98
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,228
It's okay. I'll do it.

99
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,688
Komi, you can

100
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,065
rest on that throne!

101
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,358
GOD

102
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,986
I don't have enough supplies at all.

Culture Festival Committee Member!

104
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,450
Hm?

105
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,454
-Yes? What is it?
-OTORI IS A SPACE CADET.

106
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,500
We don't have enough supplies
so I want someone to go buy more.

107
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,961
I see.

108
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,879
SLIP!

109
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,382
I mean, could you choose someone
and tell them to go?

110
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,635
Work out a budget and all that.

111
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,638
I see.

112
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,932
<i>Is she okay?</i>

113
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,852
Alright, I'll go buy them.

114
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,729
You will?

115
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,733
Don't you think a couple more people
should go along?

116
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,072
I suppose.

117
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,157
Alright.

118
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,037
Komi, do you want to come with me?

119
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,122
Huh?

120
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,415
Is it alright to ask Komi?

121
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,042
She's a god! It's sacrilegious!

122
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,088
You seem free. Let's go!

123
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,092
NOD

124
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,302

I want to go too!

128
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,061
-Me too!
-Me too!

129
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,689
<i>We can't!</i>

130
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,860
<i>We have to make this culture festival</i>
<i>a success for Komi's sake…</i>

131
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,154
<i>There's no time for shopping.</i>

132
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,156
I guess we should stay.

133
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,366
Alright, I'll--

134
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,993
If we can't go, you can't either!

135
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,077
Whoa.

136
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,746
IN THE END, THREE OF THEM WENT.

137
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,126
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

138
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,045
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

139
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,842
<i>Bear in mind,</i>
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

140
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,429
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

141
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,266
We're here!

142
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,768
It sure took a while.

143
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,937
Now, what do we need?

144
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,607
Panels, paint, cloth…

145
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,402
Alright! Let's split up…

146
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,783
No, let's go together.

147
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,996
<i>Onemine felt like something</i>
<i>bad might happen if she left them alone.</i>

148
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,708
Home improvement stores are so exciting!

149
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,002
You know what I mean?

150
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,964
Is this the kind of panel they need?

151
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:27,882
Kaede?

152
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,636
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

153
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,553
Huh?

154
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,306
It's my first time here, though.

155
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,851
Oh! You mean about
home improvement stores being exciting.

156
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,520
Is that right.

157
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,064
It's your first time at a…

158
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,774
-GONE
-She disappeared!

159
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,611
Th-This is an emergency!
Let's split up and look for her!

160
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,907
Huh?

161
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,036
I wonder where everyone went?

162
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:02,416
Oh, Komi. Hi there.

163
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,963
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

164
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,470
Are you mad?

165
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,350
Oh, then I'm glad.

166
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,188
You seem like…

167
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,149
you want to chat.

168
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,903
Take your time.

169
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,992
You're going to write it?

170
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,454
WHY DID YOU ASK ME TO COME?

171
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,833
Hm. Good question.

172
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,252
I don't know.

173
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,878
It's just…

174
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,258
when I saw you with Tadano and the others,

175
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:57,888
I wanted to become friends
with you too, I guess.

176
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,311
Hm?

177
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,022
IN JUNIOR HIGH, DURING CLASS EVENTS,

178
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,357
I COULDN'T REALLY HELP OR PARTICIPATE.

179
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,067
I FELT BAD I COULDN'T HELP.

180
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,573
WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO HELP…

181
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,996
I WAS REALLY HAPPY.

182
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,084
GONE

183
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,919
Komi!

184
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,299
-What's this?
-Miss!

185
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,640
Sheesh! Kaede, you're such a handful.

186
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,642
Onemine.

187
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:47,104
I'm friends with Komi now!

188
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,565
Really? That's nice.

189
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,111
Oh, of course, you're my friend too.

190
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,322
Yeah, thanks.

191
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,992
Komi!

192
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,996
Let's work hard for the culture festival!

193
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,922
Yes.

194
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,383
<i>She spoke!</i>

195
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:25,267
We have to ask her to help out more!

196
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,108
The shopping team is back!

197
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,239
Let's go help them carry the supplies!

198
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,742
Yeah.

199
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,374
We're going to hand out festival flyers!

200
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,211
Here we are!
At Itan Shopping Street by the school.

201
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:57,383
We'll give flyers to the shopkeepers,
and ask them to put them up!

202
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,136
C'mon Komi, you're up!

203
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,179
<i>I figured that was your plan!</i>

204
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,141
Okay, first you show her how it's done.

205
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,685
Well, if you insist.

206
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,354
Hello sir! Will you put up our flyer?

207
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,647
<i>That was fast!</i>

208
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,108
<i>Still talking?</i>

209
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,068
He'll put up the flyer!

210
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,903
And I got some croquettes!

211
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,072
<i>The very embodiment of people skills!</i>

212
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,369
-I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO IT.
-Really?

213
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,663
Alright Komi, let's do this!

214
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,667
Welcome!

215
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,298
Go ahead, that seat's free.

216
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,175
What would you like?

217
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,843
KOMI SAT DOWN.

218
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,805
-KOMI ATE A WHOLE MEAL.
-Huh?

219
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,351
Okay, let's try a place
you've been to before.

220
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,937
Shoko!

221
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,772
And your friends?

222
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,736
Sniff, sniff.

223
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,029
Alright.

224
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,698
You want me to put up
the flyer here, right?

225
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,700
<i>That's my brilliant boss!</i>

226
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,411
RAMEN DARO

227
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,375
<i>They're kindred spirits.</i>

228
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,086
We still have one left.

229
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,215
Let's give it to the person at this house!

230
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,175
How can you be so assertive?

231
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,969
Hello? Who's there?

232
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,306
Oh, I'm sorry. Did we wake him up?

233
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,683
It's alright. He's always like this.

234
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,395
We're students from Itan High School.

235
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,106
We're having a culture festival next week.

236
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,609
You're welcome to come.

237
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,529
Oh! Thank you.

238
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,905
RUMBLE

239
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>Huh? He stopped crying.</i>

240
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,661
Ah! Kokko!

241
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,206
-Kokko!
-Hm? What is it?

242
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,123
Ah.

243
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,376
We're finished!

244
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,046
Good job Tadano and Komi and me!

245
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,091
Let's head back.

246
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,259
Kokko!

247
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,136
We have more work to do, Kokko.

248
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,270
<i>The night before the festival.</i>

249
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,397
<i>Many of the students stayed behind,</i>

250
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,482
<i>preparing for the following day.</i>

251
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,359
<i>But the scene…</i>

252
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,236
<i>was one of corpses.</i>

253
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,156
<i>It was like a room full of dead bodies.</i>

254
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,117
Hey!

255
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,870
We made rice balls!

256
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,954
Whoa!

257
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,123
<i>The corpses came back to life.</i>

258
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,001
Wow!

259
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,004
-<i>Hang on.</i>
-<i>These rice balls…</i>

260
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,548
<i>Some were made by Komi!</i>

261
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,259
<i>Which ones? Which did she make?</i>

262
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,469
<i>I can't choose!</i>

263
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,514
<i>Who, who made the rice balls…</i>

264
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,101
-NAJIMI'S TESTIMONY
-I made strangely-shaped ones.

265
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,437
Cubes and diamonds and so on.

266
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,773
-ONEMINE'S TESTIMONY
-Mine are a little big.

267
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,734
But they're not too big to eat!

268
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,235
KOMI'S TESTIMONY

269
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,738
Komi, yours were a nice shape.

270
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,575
-YAMAI'S TESTIMONY
-Komi made small rice balls!

271
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,452
They weren't nicely shaped!

272
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,456
-So give me all the nice ones!
-SOMEONE IS LYING! GUESS WHO?

273
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,041
Rock, scissors, paper…

274
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,379
-I'll never eat this.
-Hey! Let me go!

275
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,048
I'll offer it to the deities.

276
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,507
Precious…

277
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,095
<i>I guess this is Najimi's.</i>

278
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,224
<i>It's a very well-made cube.</i>

279
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,727
<i>How was this made?</i>

280
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,229
Nom.

281
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,147
Mm?

282
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,440
It's good!

283
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,780
Now,

284
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,033
whose rice ball is Tadano eating,
I wonder?

285
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:56,038
KOMI COPIED NAJIMI AND ATTEMPTED
ONE STRANGELY-SHAPED RICE BALL.

286
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,122
NICE CUBE, KOMI!

287
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,708
<i>Hi everyone!</i>

288
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,337
<i>Welcome to the 23rd</i>

1-1 MAID CAFE ITAN

290
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,094
What's wrong, Komi?

291
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,013
Oh, you wanted a longer one?

292
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,807
A-ha-ha, there are none.

293
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,227
-Yamai fell!
-She passed out!

294
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,772
-Yamai's faking!
-Kidding! We made a longer one for you.

295
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,192
-Yamai's shooting a low-angle video!
-They're so loud.

296
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,820
PASSIONATE PLANET

297
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,825
MAID EXPERT: TATSUHITO AKIDO

298
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,373
TATSUHITO AKIDO (32)

299
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,042
<i>The maid expert's morning starts early.</i>

300
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,588
<i>It's 6 a.m.</i>
<i>He decides which maid cafe to visit.</i>

301
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,007
<i>One per day.</i>

302
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,008
<i>On that day,</i>

303
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,969
<i>He thinks only of that maid cafe.</i>

304
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,514
<i>As soon as he decides,</i>
<i>he cleanses his body.</i>

305
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,434
<i>"I mustn't make a bad impression</i>
<i>on the maids."</i>

306
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,645
<i>That's Akido's motto.</i>

307
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,484
<i>Here's where Akido chose today.</i>

308
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:12,197
<i>Itan High School Culture Festival</i>
<i>Class 1-1 Event, Maid Cafe.</i>

309
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,409
<i>Though it's only</i>
<i>a high school culture festival,</i>

310
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,413
<i>if it's too sub-par,</i>
<i>I'll just make an excuse and…</i>

311
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,332
Welcome back, Master!

312
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,669
Oh, uh, thank you.

313
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,629
<i>Akido is a regular otaku</i>

314
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>so he shrinks in front of a real girl.</i>

315
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,516
<i>Oh-ho. Excellent attention to detail</i>
<i>for a high school festival.</i>

316
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,936
<i>But inside his head, he's high and mighty.</i>

317
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,229
Thank you for waiting!

318
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,274
Can I get you something to eat?

319
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,195
Uh, I'll have
the <i>Omurice</i> Served with Lov--

320
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,696
Yessir!

321
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,406
Ah.

322
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,910
<i>The peppy character… Very nice.</i>

323
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,413
What is thine desire?

324
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,916
Wh-Whoa! I-I'm sorry!

325
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,044
Ugh. Hurry up and decide.

326
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,378
Uh…

327
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>Geeky, clumsy, prickly, peppy.</i>

328
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,676
<i>They've got all the archetypes.</i>

329
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,594
Oh!

330
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,979
Uh.

331
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,481
Um.

332
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,690
<i>Wha…?!</i>

333
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,319
<i>W-Why is she scowling at me like that?</i>

334
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,822
<i>Oh! I know.</i>

335
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,700
<i>I've been ogling the maids so openly.</i>

336
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,664
<i>It's certainly not appropriate for</i>
<i>a man to have feelings for his maids.</i>

337
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,625
<i>That's why you're mad, right?</i>

338
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,918
Ah.

339
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,295
Pa…

340
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,005
on…

341
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,924
<i>Pa…on…?</i>

342
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,801
<i>"Patronizing"! I knew it!</i>

*PARDON ME

344
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,514
Here's your <i>omurice</i>!

345
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,434
I… I'll be going.

346
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,312
GLOOM

347
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,150
KOMI THINKS HE'S UPSET
BECAUSE OF HER POOR SERVICE.

348
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,610
Please…

349
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,032
Uh…

350
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,327
C'mon Komi, the farewell greeting is,

351
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,705
"Please come back soon, Master!"

352
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,206
Right?

353
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,546
<i>Saying the wrong farewell greeting</i>
<i>is taboo for a maid.</i>

354
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,423
<i>But…</i>

355
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,386
<i>I guess she's an ice-queen type.</i>

356
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,304
Hm?

357
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,056

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,978
<i>Once again, this encounter will</i>

MAID CAFE

360
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,691
Tadano! Tadano!

361
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,194
We have the maid outfit
that Komi rejected!

362
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,653
No.

363
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,280
Woo-woo!

364
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,241
I said no.

365
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,743
MAIDS CHANGING

366
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,707
TADANO

367
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,502
-What are you doing, Tadano?
-It looks stupid, Tadano.

368
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,796
-<i>Not bad.</i>
-Cut it out, guys!

369
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,551
STARE

370
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,386
Can I take it off yet?

371
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,097
You chose this, so take it seriously.

372
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,724
You made me wear it!

373
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,936
Shoko! I've arrived!

374
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>Komi's mom is here!</i>

375
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,983
Right this way!

376
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,402
Thanks!

377
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,947
H-Here's some water.

378
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,864
Huh?

379
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,866
Tadano?

380
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,576
Uh, yes.

381
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,954
Oh. I see…

382
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,789
It… It's not like that, okay?

383
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,042
What are you doing? Shosuke, come here!

384
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,044
-Sho…
-…suke?

385
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,676
Wow! So cool and cute!

386
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,637
ALL THE MAIDS STOLE HIM AWAY.

387
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,060
SHOSUKE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE
AND LEFT IMMEDIATELY.

388
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,985
Hitohito! I was bored, so I came.

389
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,069
Oh.

390
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,239
Uh.

391
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,407
Don't act like that.

392
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,911
Hey, Mom? Did you see?

393
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,997
Yeah, you were right about him.

394
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,206
Right about what?!

395
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,666
MAIDS ON BREAK

396
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,502
Darn you Najimi.

397
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,130
Hm?

398
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,008
Komi! Good work out there!

399
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,811
Today went really well!

400
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,902
This doesn't suit me, does it?

401
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,074
YOU LOOK CUTE.

402
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,995
Huh? Oh, thank you… very much.

403
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,210
<i>The two started to feel awkward.</i>
