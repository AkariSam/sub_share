00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,920
MISSION 16
"IT'S JUST A JOKE."

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,806
Morning, Komi.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,266
You're early…

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,226
<i>Already?</i>

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,229
What's wrong?

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,857
SHOW

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:31,114
<i>What could she be so nervous to tell me?</i>

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,616
THE BEDBUG BUGGED THE BED.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,787
Is this… code?

10
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,331
What is it?

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,504
"Yesterday, on TV they said
humor is important for communication.

12
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,966
So I wrote down a joke I heard recently."

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,384
<i>Recently?</i>

14
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:56,014
Um, jokes like that
work better in the right situation.

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,687
-I ALMOST STEPPED IN A POODLE.
-<i>It is raining cats and dogs…</i>

16
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,732
I don't mean it wasn't funny.

17
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,192
But with jokes,

18
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,903
it works better if you say them out loud.

19
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,580
VIBRATE

20
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,706
My phone?

21
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,837
<i>What language do oranges speak?</i>
<i>Mandarin.</i>

22
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>What's with all the dad jokes, Komi?!</i>

23
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,052
KOMI CAME BACK.

24
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,055
-HOW WERE THEY?
-<i>Should I say it?</i>

25
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,016
<i>Dad jokes just aren't funny.</i>
<i>Should I tell her?</i>

26
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,976
Morning!

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,397
I hate how damp and sticky this season is.

28
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>I'm saved.</i>

29
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,735
Now that I think of it.

30
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,030
-HARPOON ON THE BOOM.
-This sinister note was in my locker.

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,698
<i>Another victim!</i>

32
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,660
-TADANO EXPLAINS.
-I see.

33
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,747
I thought for sure
it was an encoded death threat.

34
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,208
Alright Tadano.

35
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,418
Show Komi how it's done!

36
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,213
Huh?

37
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,134
EXCITED

38
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,218
<i>She's waiting.</i>

39
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,804
<i>I guess I'd better do it?</i>

40
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,853
Puns about the wind… blow.

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,564
Terrible.

42
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,440
<i>The same level as Komi.</i>

43
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,862
-W-WOW…
-SPARKLE

44
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,917
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,503
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

46
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,052
<i>Bear in mind,</i>
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

47
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,806
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

48
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,695
MISSION 17
"IT'S JUST SHOPPING."

49
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,282
Hey Komi, where do you buy your clothes?

50
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,742
"You've never bought any?!"

51
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:49,455
So… what do you do on your days off?

52
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,917
-I DON'T GO OUT VERY MUCH, SO…
-<i>That's sad, Komi!</i>

53
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,462
Alright. Let's go clothes shopping today!

54
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,839
TO THE STATION!

55
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,809
UM… I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT, BUT…

56
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,978
-THAT'S SCARY.
-<i>Scary?!</i>

57
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,272
It's not scary.

58
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,857
Tadano will be there too.

59
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,692
I'm going too?

60
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,027
Of course.

61
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,820
<i>Is that alright?</i>

62
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,365
<i>Guys and girls shopping together…</i>

63
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,701
<i>All that changing of clothes…</i>

64
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,412
<i>Look, Komi's conflicted!</i>

65
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,873
I probably shouldn't--

66
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,958
You need to be her interpreter.

67
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,711
-For me.
-Oh, right.

68
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,423
Can I invite someone else too?

69
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,675
NOD

70
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,302
-Agari!
-Yes!

71
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,637
Do you want to go shopping today?

72
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,765
Shopping?

73
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,350
Walkies for your dog?

74
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,228
I-I'd love to! I'll go!

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,315
It's not a walkie.

76
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,359
First we'll walk around…

77
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,989
Komi!

78
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,575
What a coincidence!

79
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,703
<i>It doesn't smell like a coincidence!</i>

80
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,665
Is everyone shopping? Can I join you?

81
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,418
Did you follow us?

82
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,837
What are you talking about, Najimi?

83
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,380
Oh, nothing.

84
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,884
Hey, Komi.

85
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,679
What sort of clothes do you like?

86
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,183
You have regular clothes, don't you?

87
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,559
What style are they?

88
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,769
Yeah!

89
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,771
I DON'T KNOW. MY MOM BUYS THEM.

90
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,939
<i>Your mom?!</i>

91
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,027
I KNOW I NEED SOME CLOTHES,
BUT I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR SHOPPING.

92
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,487
<i>I know the feeling!</i>

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,783
Alright, let's have a contest
to choose clothes for Komi!

94
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,742
BAM

95
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,871
<i>A contest to choose clothes</i>
<i>for Komi to wear?!</i>

96
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,500
The rules are simple.
Choose an outfit worth 10,000 yen or less.

97
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,504
She tries them on and we score them.
The highest score wins!

98
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,964
I'm itching to start.

99
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,800
I-I'll do my best
to get Komi to choose me!

100
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,552
Can't we choose togeth--

101
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,721
Alright, ready, go!

102
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,435
-Wow, what a pretty mannequin.
-It's so realistic!

103
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,146
<i>Komi is mistaken for a mannequin.</i>

104
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,273
It's time!

105
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,650
Komi has finished changing!

106
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,569
Let's see her outfit!

107
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,112
Komi!

108
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,827
-Komi? Can you come out?
-TOO SHY TO SHOW THEM.

109
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,328

Easily exceeded the 10,000 yen limit!

118
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,278
Huh? Price?

119
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,864
It's alright! I'll buy it for you!

120
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,032
<i>So flippant.</i>

121
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,868

Huh? Isn't it cute?

00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,135
Uh… This is just, um…

129
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,513
I don't know anything
about women's fashion.

130
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,056
I just chose whatever.

131
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,351
It's not like…
I'm into girls like this or anything.

132
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,978
Enough with the virgin excuses. Hurry up!

Huh? You want to do it again?

144
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,862
My last one was a joke.

145

MISSION 18
"IT'S JUST THE HAIR SALON."

146
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,466
SHE MADE UP HER MIND.

<i>I'm eager to learn!</i>

150
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,561
What are you doing?

151
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,647
<i>This is my talented boss, Maki Karisu.</i>

152
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,733
<i>I admire her so much!</i>

-If you're not busy, go clean outside.
-Yes!

00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,613
<i>I'm new here,</i>

<i>Surely she must be! Alright!</i>

00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,713
Welcome! Come on in!

161
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,214
TREMBLE

162
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,925
<i>No? Just a passer-by?</i>

163
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>What should I do? This is so awkward!</i>

164
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,388
Oh, it's Shoko.

165
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,933
You're here. Come on in.

166
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,143
<i>She went in!</i>

167
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,979
<i>She was a customer after all!</i>

168

<i>Why didn't she come in when I said it?</i>

169
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,736
<i>Was my smile weird?</i>

170
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,154
<i>Was I too aggressive?</i>

171
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,406
<i>D-Do I smell?</i>

172
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,118
<i>No! That's just the difference</i>
<i>between me and a pro!</i>

173
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,412
My boss is amazing!

174
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,289
What was that?

175
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,086
It's been a while, Shoko.

176
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,462
What would you like?

177
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,470
Alright, blonde and short.

178
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,429
SHAKE SHAKE

179
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,680
Just kidding.

180
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,140
The usual, right?

181
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,062
<i>She's so pretty.</i>

182
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,106
<i>Such straight, long hair…</i>

183
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,608
<i>It would be a waste to cut it.</i>

184
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,318
<i>My boss, too.</i>

185
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,238
<i>She looks so pretty and dignified</i>
<i>when she cuts.</i>

186
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,658
<i>The two together are like a painting.</i>

187
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,743
What are you doing, Arai?

188
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,080
-Get back to work.
-Yes, sorry.

189
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,582
Feel free to read the…

190
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,793
<i>Huh?</i>

191
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,795
<i>She's sleeping.</i>

192
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,755
<i>She's so cute.</i>

193
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,924
She's just pretending to sleep.

194
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,467
SO NOBODY TALKS TO HER

195
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,805
That reminds me, Shoko.
You're in high school now, right?

196
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,723
How's high school life?

197
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,645
F.

198
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,897
Ah, as long as you're having fun.

199
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,525
<i>They can communicate with just one sound?</i>

200
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,152
<i>My boss is amazing!</i>

201
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,947
Arai, give her a shampoo.

202
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,991
<i>That's me! My job!</i>

203
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,659
Yes ma'am!

204
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,662
<i>I should chat with the customer too.</i>

205
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,373
I just started working here from April.

206
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,750
If I do anything wrong, just tell me!

207
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,171
How long have you
been coming to this salon?

208
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,382
<i>Display my weakness while</i>
<i>asking easy questions!</i>

209
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,967
<i>It's perfect!</i>

210
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,051
POINT

211
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,556
Huh? 12? Since you were 12?

212
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,641
<i>She used the magazine to answer?</i>

213
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,687
<i>What does it mean? Why did she answer</i>
<i>by pointing at the magazine?</i>

214
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,356
<i>She could just say, "Since I was 12."</i>

215
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,235
<i>Maybe she didn't want to talk to me?</i>
<i>Is that it?</i>

216
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,571
<i>She wouldn't enter the shop either.</i>

217
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,657
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

218
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,825
<i>At this rate,</i>

219
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,536
<i>I'll never become a pro hairstylist!</i>

220
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,207
Why… why?

221
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,626
THE WHOLE PROCESS IS FINISHED.

222
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,252
Well? You like it?

223
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,339
I'm glad.

224
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,511
That's 4,800 yen exactly.

225
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,804
Here's your receipt.

226
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,904
Thank you very much!
Please come again!

227
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,792
Ms. Karisu.

228
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:00,214
I thought that customer hated me.

229
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:07,471
Well, some people just don't like
chatting at the salon.

230
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,181
OUR WAY TO SAY THANK YOU

231
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,267
-THANK YOU.
-I see.

232
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,937
THE NEXT DAY

233
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,649
Howdy, Komi!

234
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,652
K-Komi! G-Good m-m-morning!

235
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,946
Morning Komi!

236
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,907
Looking good!

237
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,618
Good morning, Komi.

238
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,291
Did you cut your hair?

239
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,925
No way! Did you really cut it?

240
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,927
It hasn't changed.

241
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,139
I can't believe I missed
a change in my master.

242
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,641
How could I not notice?!

MISSION 19
"IT'S JUST AN UNSETTLING FEELING."

244
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,690
<i>People with social anxiety</i>
<i>tend to do this.</i>

245
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,696
<i>They tend to</i>
<i>overanalyze things they say and do</i>

246
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,531
<i>which keeps them up at night.</i>

247

CONVERSATION WITH YAMAI

248
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,994
Komi, do you have a favorite food?

249
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,204
I'll make it for you.

250
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,083
FRIED EGGS.

251
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,668
Fried eggs! Got it!

252
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,753
WAS I TOO SLOW?

253
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,879
AM I TOO BORING?

254
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,005
ARE EGGS CHILDISH?

255
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,215
CONVERSATION WITH NAJIMI

256
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,593
Let's play a game together!

257
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,555
O… OKAY!

258
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,265
Yay!

259
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,475
WAS I BEING WEIRD?

260
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,726
WHY THE CAT EARS?

261
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,436
CONVERSATION WITH AGARI

262
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,271
The jacket got wet.

263
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,649
I'm so clumsy.

264
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,900
HEE-HEE

265
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,320
WAS IT COLD?

266
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,073
My book…? No, I don't think so.

267
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,955
I MISUNDERSTOOD!
JACKET = BOOK JACKET

268
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,415
CONVERSATION WITH TADANO

269
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,378
Sounds like you got the words mixed up.

270
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,254
I-I'm sorry!

271
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
I wasn't clear when I spoke!

272
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,093
<i>I bet they'll both feel bad afterwards.</i>

273
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,512
I-It's alright!

274
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,972
It happens often.

275
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,182
I used to think the country Turkey

276
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,936
was the same as turkey, the bird.
Like how surreal is that?

277
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,315
Like, y'know, "Hungary" and "hungry".

278
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,235
Uh, yeah.

GLANCE

282
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,430
I want to die.

283
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,391
<i>Maybe we should ask what's wrong.</i>

284
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,438
Oh, I don't actually want to die. Sorry.

285
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,691
Alright, I'll ask. Why?

286
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,901
Why? Did you just say "Why"?

287
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,529
Alright. I'll tell you.

288
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,032
Exams start next week! That's why!

289
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,159
You hate exams, don't you.

290
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,618
Yeah!

291
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,456
Paying attention in class is enough.

292
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,293
I want to have fun. Have fun…

293
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,047
Hey! Let's all study together!

294
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,257
I'm not getting study vibes.

295
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,218
S-Study for exams?

296
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,180
G-Go ahead! Feel free!

297
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,767
I haven't been in a library for 15 years.

298
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,894
So you've never been to one.

299
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,313
Well spotted, Tadano!

300
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,355
WHACK

301
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,027
Quiet in the library!

302
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,282
Agari, who's that?

303
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,369
That's Gorimi Senpai.

304
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,412
Gorimi?!

305
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,082
She hits noisy students
with a paper fan.

306
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,958
Three strikes and you're out.

307
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,376
<i>What a weird rule.</i>

308
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,513
TRASHBOY IS TRASH

309
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,811
Look at thi--

310
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,313
Quiet in the library.

311
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,315
<i>That paper fan is the loudest.</i>

NAJIMI 2 STRIKES

313
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,696
<i>Isn't that…?</i>

314
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,867
If you start doing that,

315
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,035
you'll die!

316
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,246
It's fun, Tadano.

317
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,789
<i>Sheesh.</i>

318
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,750

RELIEF

322
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,676
Next is your turn, Tadano.

323
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,431
<i>We're being watched! Very closely!</i>

324
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,059
No, um, I'm…

325
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,691
A-Alright.

326
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,618
Quiet in the library!

327
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,037
<i>Three strikes. Najimi was out.</i>

328
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,541
Gosh. I'm sorry.

329
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,960
MY FIRST STRIKE. THAT WAS FUN.

330
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,378
Fun?

331
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,428
I WANTED TO PLAY, TOO.

332
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,601
Ah, to tell you the truth, me too.

333
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,518
THEY LEFT.

334
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,688
Let's join Najimi.

335
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,814
KOMI, NAJIMI, TADANO

337
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,070
Pretty smart for someone
who hates studying.

338
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,032
You did great, Komi.

339
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,576

00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,365
<i>Probably trembling</i>
<i>and staring at her phone.</i>

363
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,827
-<i>No, no, no…</i>
-Hitohito?

364
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,788
<i>But on the off chance…</i>

365
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,916
<i>I could call and check.</i>

366
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,127
<i>But no…</i>

367
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,337
SHOCK

368
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,549
Mom, I think Hitohito might be sick.

369
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,260
KOMI MADE UP HER MIND AND CALLED TADANO.

370
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,644
<i>Oh, hello, Komi?</i>

371
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,439
<i>It's everyone's childhood friend,</i>
<i>Najimi Osana!</i>

372
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,067
<i>Let's go to the pool tomorrow!</i>

373
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,029
<i>I invited Tadano and he said okay.</i>

374
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,447
<i>How about you, Komi?</i>

375
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,369
<i>Komi, can you hear me?</i>

376
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,955
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

377
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,457
I…

378
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,791
I'll go.

379
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,335
<i>Yay!</i>

380
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,296
<i>See you tomorrow at 12</i>
<i>at Yomikiri Land Station!</i>

381
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,213
<i>Bye!</i>

382
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,898
FIST PUMP
