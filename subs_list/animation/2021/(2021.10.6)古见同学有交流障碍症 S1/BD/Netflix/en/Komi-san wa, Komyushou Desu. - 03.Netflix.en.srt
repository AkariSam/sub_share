00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,003
LUNCH BREAK

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,215
LIBRARY

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,136
A new issue!

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,638
<i>My name is Himiko Agari.</i>

5
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>I'm a very nervous person.</i>

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>If people look at me,</i>

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,353
<i>I just stop functioning.</i>

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,814
<i>And right now…</i>

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,986
<i>I'm being watched by my classmate, Komi.</i>

10
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>Bear in mind,</i>

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

14
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,959
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

15
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,344
MISSION 05 "IT'S JUST STAGE FRIGHT."

16
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>Komi is beautiful, smart, and popular.</i>

17
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>But she's down to earth.</i>

18
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,605
<i>She's always so dignified.</i>

19
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,567
<i>She's brooding, reserved, and cool.</i>

20
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>The more I think about her,</i>
<i>the more I admire her!</i>

21
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,656
<i>Me?</i>

22
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,367
<i>My eyes are bad,</i>
<i>and I'm not cute or anything.</i>

23
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,705
<i>I'm chubby, my legs are short,</i>
<i>and I get stage fright easily.</i>

24
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,584
<i>Komi… why are you looking at me?</i>

25
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,294
<i>I-I'm scared!</i>

26
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,378
DID I DO SOMETHING?

27
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>My stomach hurts!</i>

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,340
SINK

29
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,601
<i>I can relax in the restroom.</i>

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,021
<i>It's my own personal space.</i>

31
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,316
<i>Nobody can see me.</i>
<i>Nobody is thinking about me.</i>

32
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,026
<i>I love the restroom.</i>

33
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,321
<i>I could spend my life here.</i>

34
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,489
<i>Someone's there!</i>

35
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,241
CAME TO ASK "ARE YOU OKAY?" (BUT CAN'T)

36
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>Sorry!</i>

37
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,455
<i>I don't remember what I did,</i>
<i>but I'm sorry!</i>

38
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,582
<i>Please! I'll do anything!</i>

39
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:31,419
<i>Forgive me! God! Buddha! Komi!</i>

40
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,130
SHUFFLE

41
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,841
<i>My prayers were answered!</i>

42
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,511
<i>Now's my chance.</i>

43
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,305
Oh, Agari!

44
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,806
Perfect timing.

45
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,726
Uh, um, yes? W-W-What can I foo for you?

46
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,270
<i>Ah! I was so nervous I messed up!</i>

47
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,439
Sixth period gym class.

48
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,816
It's in the gymnasium, not outside.

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,777
Tell the class for me.

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,364
Uh, but… I… Um… Ah!

51
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,115
<i>I've got to get away!</i>

52
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,825
Yes! Of course!

53
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,494
Oh! Good answer.

54
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,081
<i>Now what should I do?</i>

55
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,457
<i>I've got to do it.</i>

56
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,375
RESPONSIBILITY

57
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,543
<i>But my stomach hurts…</i>

58
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,589
It's alright!
You've got this, Himiko Agari!

59
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,507
Ah!

60
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,593
Calm down! Just say this, loud and clear…

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,638
"Sixth period gym is in the gymnasium."

62
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,348
Right? It's easy!

63
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,768
Don't be afraid. Just speak clearly.

64
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:33,439
<i>Yes. In a loud voice,</i>
<i>so I don't have to repeat myself.</i>

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,441
Pa!

66
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,068
Pa?

67
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,612
<i>What?! What is "Pa"?!</i>

68
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,031
<i>Why did I say that?</i>

69
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,951
-<i>Everyone's looking! I'm so embarrassed!</i>
-You okay?

70
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,868
What?

71
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,455
<i>I wish I could just disappe…</i>

72
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,125
SHOCK

73
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,794
Sixth period gym is in the gymnasium!

74
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,753
-HUH?!
-BOW!

75
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,632
<i>Wow! I can't believe it!</i>

76
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,303
<i>I…</i>

77
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,512
<i>I said it!</i>

78
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,015
EUPHORIA

79
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,977
HUBBUB

80
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,398
What happened?

81
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,984
<i>Rewind the story by 20 minutes.</i>

82
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,320
20 MINUTES BEFORE

83
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,113
And anyway,

84
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,783
I wanted to say I can't
be friends with just anyone.

85
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,078
Komi must have preferences too, right?

86
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,789
What are you on about, Najimi?

87
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,918
From all of my childhood friends,

88
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,589
I've picked the people with
the closest personalities to Komi!

89
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,050
Let's get her next friend from this list!

90
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,218
What?? I love it.

91
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,429
First off.

92
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,057
Same class. Himiko Agari.

93
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,143
Oh, she was nervous
during self-introductions.

94
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,144
Yeah.

95
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,438
Agari is a good kid.

96
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,107
But she gets stressed around people.

97
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,235
Specifically, she goes red
just from being looked at.

98
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,738
She cramps, hyperventilates,
gets tongue-tied,

99
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,866
sweats a lot
and her stomach starts to hurt.

100
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,701
Poor kid.

101
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,661
KOMI FEELS A KINSHIP.

102
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,038
Huh? Komi?

103
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,459
Wanna hear about number two?

104
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,376
Ah.

105
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,837
What happened to Komi?

106
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,799
Agari's gone too.

107
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,760
KOMI CAME TO SAY HELLO,
BUT NOTHING CAME OUT.

108
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,969
THE PRESENT

109
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:32,433
I see.
And in the end you couldn't talk to Agari.

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,435
SHE WROTE IT ALL DOWN.

111
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,978
GLOOM

112
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,649
It's alright! You'll have another chance.

113
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,400
-Uh, um.
-Ah!

114
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,655
Komi, uh.

115
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,575
You kept staring at me.

116
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,786
And, uh.

117
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,038
It was really scary!

118
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,498
SHOCK

119
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,458
IT WAS SCARY!

120
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,210
But…

121
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:05,216
I don't know why you were looking at me.

122
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,426
But…

123
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,888
Thanks to you, I…

124
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,558
was able to change a little!

125
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:19,063
So I wanted to say thank you!

126
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,027
<i>Now's my chance!</i>

127
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,490
Um, you two seem like you'd get along.

128
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,661
What if you became friends?

129
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,247
Huh? That's i-i-impossible!

130
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,915
Nonononononono!

131
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,042
Uh, no, I mean…

132
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,880
I'm not worthy enough to be Komi's friend.

133
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,299
But…

134
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,633
PANT

135
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:52,680
If you want me to be your dog,
I'll do my best!

136
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,808
Please treat me well!

137
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,061
<i>Komi got another friend.</i>

138
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,647
BEFORE CLASS

139
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,357
TA-DA

140
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,651
MISSION 06 "IT'S JUST A CELL PHONE."

141
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,528
What's up?

142
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,658
BEEP

143
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,953
NOT BOTHERED BY HER PACE ANYMORE

144
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,456
TAPPED THE WRONG KEY AND ERASED EVERYTHING

145
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,917
BEGINNING TO GET BOTHERED

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,710
MY PARENTS BOUGHT ME A PHONE.

147
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,754
<i>A flip phone? In this age??</i>

148
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,592
So, you've never had a phone until now?

149
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,928
I NEVER NEEDED ONE BEFORE.

150
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,347
<i>That's really sad, Komi.</i>

151
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,059
BUT

152
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,023
NOW I NEED ONE.

153
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,526
THANKS TO YOU, I MADE LOTS OF FRIENDS.

154
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,736
<i>Komi!</i>

155
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,239
ABOUT TO CRY

156
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,949
AND SO, UM…

157
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,622
GLANCE

158
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,418
I NEED MY FRIENDS' NUMBERS.

159
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,003
I see.

160
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>Why did she hesitate?</i>

161
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,969
Okay, let's go ask Najimi and Agari.

162
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,524
<i>She's pausing more than usual.</i>

163
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,530
I RELY ON YOU TOO MUCH. I'LL MANAGE.

164
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,781
<i>Komi!</i>

165
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,117
<i>You've grown so quickly.</i>

166
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,201
FATHERLY PRIDE

167
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,079
Oh! Morning Komi!

168
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:40,997
What's up?

169
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,708
TREMBLE

170
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,834
What?

171
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,420
Why is Komi pointing a flip phone at me?

172
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,213
Tadano! Translate!

173
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:53,050
<i>Sorry Najimi, I can only watch.</i>

174
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,802
Paper.

175
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,679
Phone.

176
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,225
Date… numbers?

177
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,479
You want my phone number?

178
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,856
NOD

179
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,941
<i>Yes! Alright!</i>

180
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,237
I could just enter it,
instead of writing it down.

181
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,905
Ah!

182
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,283
I see. Alright.

183
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,536
Tadano's pretty thick
for such a perceptive guy.

184
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
Dumbass.

185
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,206
Why are they talking about me?

186
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,916
AGARI'S SEAT

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,044
Oh, K-K-Komi.

188
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,879
Good morning!

189
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,924
Need a massage? Shall I buy you a drink?

190
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,968
-Want me to lick your shoes?
-Ew.

191
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:44,727
Do you want to take a slutty picture of me
and use it for your wallpaper?

192
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,979
I'm so happy.

193
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,898
<i>She gave up.</i>

194
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,154
You did well, Komi.

195
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,407
You got Najimi's number anyway.

196
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,412
SHOW…

197
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,538
Huh?

198
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,248
I'm sorry!

199
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,460
You wanted my phone number, didn't you?

200
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,253
I misunderstood.

201
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,883
Of course, if you're going to call
your dog, you need a phone.

202
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,009
Huh?

203
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,719
Also…

204
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,390
Komi wants to put
Tadano's number in first.

205
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,017
So write your number on a piece of paper.

206
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,062
That's what Najimi told me.

207
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,903
I've got bad timing.

208
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,699
I-Is that true?

209
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
NOD

210
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,205
W-Well then…

211
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,751
BEEP

212
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,462
Here you go.

213
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,173
CAN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT

214
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,135

215
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,057
Uh.

216
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,521
<i>Tadano screamed inside his heart.</i>

217
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,442

MISSION 07 "IT'S JUST A STUDENT ELECTION."

219
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,280
We're choosing class committees.

220
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,741
First, class president.

221
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,410
The top of our class.

222
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,996
Does anyone want to do it?

223
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,998
SILENCE

224
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,500
What a bunch of slackers!

225
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,877
Okay, nominations?

226
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,086
EVERYONE'S GAZE

227
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,755
KOMI

228
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,133
No other nominations?

229
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,968
I don't see any.

230
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,512
Alright, Komi. You want to do it?

231
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,850
-Huh?
-What?

232
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,312
SHIVER

233
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,440
Trembling with excitement, I see.

234
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,358
You're clearly very motivated!

235
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,276
IMPOSSIBLE.

236
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,694
HELP ME…

237
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,071
<i>Komi's biggest crisis yet.</i>

238
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:01,989
Hmm.

239
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,743
<i>The only option is to nominate myself…</i>

240
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,702
RAISE

241
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,331
I oppose Komi for class president.

242
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,790
<i>Najimi?</i>

243
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,585
<i>I'll take care of this.</i>

244
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,378
<i>Najimi's a hero!</i>

245
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,881
Huh? What are you saying, Najimi?

246
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,840
Oppose, huh?

247
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,761
-We're old friends but I won't hold back.
-What's your reason?

248
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,014
<i>Najimi! I can't believe it!</i>

249
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,100
<i>You sacrificed yourself to save Komi?</i>

250
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,312
-Think about it, guys.
-Huh?

251
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:38,776
Komi's greatness can't be contained
within the small role of class president.

252
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,362
You have a point!

253
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,279
Huh?

254
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:47,076
I demand a higher rank for Komi!

255
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,410
-Totally.
-Yeah.

256
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,246
I agree with Najimi.

257
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,374
Let's all decide Komi's position!

258
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,251
Yay!

259
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,462
GENERAL, EMPEROR, BOSS, CEO,
SHE WHO MUSTN'T BE NAMED

260
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,172
Alright.

261
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,551
Komi's student council position
is "God" then.

262
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,677
GOD

263
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,470
Ko-mi! G-od!

264
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,265
The position of class president is open.

265
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,850
No nominations or volunteers?

266
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,066
Tadano will do.

267
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,402
We have our god, so it doesn't matter.

268
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,863
-I second Tadano.
-Might as well have Tadano.

269
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,574
Work hard for our god, Tadano.

270
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,577
Alright, class president is Tadano.

271
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,453
<i>I got forced into it.</i>

272
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,040
TADANO WANTED TO BE ON

Hello? Komi?

00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,454
Um, I think you may have dialed
the wrong number by accident,

293
00:15:55,537 --> 00:16:01,293
but just in case there's something wrong,
I tried calling back.

294
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,673
If you're okay,
just say "Ah" or something.

295
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,424
Um.

00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,344

<i>I'm sorry. It was the wrong number.</i>

00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,897
Oh.

00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,150
<i>Sounds like she can talk a bit</i>

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,510
After school, when everyone's gone,

328
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,889
we can invite Najimi and Agari
and have a private game.

00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,733
It's fine! Come on over!

333
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,902
No way! Is Komi joining us?

334
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,819
Oops.

335
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,782
Oh no, my face is breaking out today.

336
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:59,244
It's okay.
Everyone's happy to have you. Right?

337
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,831
Her Majesty? Here?

338
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,793
-A manifestation of a god?
-We are blessed.

339
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,754
Though it's not a typical
display of happiness.

340
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,965
Uh… Ah! Huh?

341
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,425
Heh-heh.

344
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,976
<i>Watch Komi get bullied?</i>

345
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,980
<i>Damn it! I guess I've gotta try!</i>

346
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,820
Um, can I join too?

347
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:38,200
Of course. The more the merrier.

348
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,328
-Are you joining us too?
-Ahaha, yay!

349
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,538
Join us.

350
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,915
<i>Huh? Who does he think he is?</i>

351
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,001
<i>I'll be nice for Her Majesty,</i>
<i>but seriously, beat it, trash.</i>

352
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,170
-<i>Read the room.</i>
-<i>Ahaha, go away.</i>

353
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,255
<i>Begone.</i>

354
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,674
<i>I can practically hear</i>
<i>what they're thinking.</i>

355
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,261
The Saito Game is kind of hard.

356
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,388
So let's start with Yubisuma.

357
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,099
Hold out your fists
and say a number in turn.

358
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,978
If the thumb count matches your number,
remove a fist and continue.

359
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,855
You win once both are gone. Easy, right?

360
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,648
I'll start.

361
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,150
Yubisuma, six.

362
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,985
One too few.

363
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,237
Twinkle, nine.

364
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,613
Oh, yay!

365
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,531
Huh?

366
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,825
Ready, set, four!

367
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,826
Oh no.

368
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,952
Huh?

369
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,913
-Chichichichi barichichi, 10!
-Hang on a second!

370
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,375
<i>The game has many local variations.</i>

371
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,628
<i>In the end, everyone did it their own way.</i>

372
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,130
<i>Is this really okay?</i>

373
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,339
Yay!

374
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,299
KOMI'S TURN

375
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,138
Five.

376
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,017
SLICK…

377
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,643
They let her win!

378
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,604
KOMI WON!
TADANO GOT LAST PLACE.

379
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,189
Heh.

380
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,816
Looks like she got the hang of it.

381
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,485
Let's up the stakes.

382
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,654
Let's play Bamboo Shoot!

383
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,574
The loser has to make a kissy face!

384
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,868
A kissy face?!

385
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:07,331
I want to see Komi's kissy face!

386
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,291
Bamboo Shoot is…

387
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,585
a game of speed
with yelling and arm raising.

388
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,670
Everyone counts in sequential order.

389
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,589
Say the wrong number and you lose!

390
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,883
It's a thinking game! Try it at home!

391
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,719
I've got to win!

392
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,806
A kiss? A kissy face to me?

393
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,100
<i>The mood has changed!</i>

394
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,061
Let's begin.

395
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,562
Bamboo, bamboo…

396
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,773
Shoot! One shoot!

397
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,733
WATCHING A RIDICULOUS SCENE

398
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,817
EVERYONE LOST

399
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,611
Okay, once more.

400
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,196
Bamboo, bamboo. Shoot!

401
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,406
-One shoot!
-Cheater!

402
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,824
-Two shoot!
-Three shoot!

403
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,243
-Four shoot!
-Five shoot!

404
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,037
<i>They're like a well-oiled machine!</i>

405
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,873
<i>They're aiming to see Komi's kissy face!</i>

406
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,335
You two are the only ones left.

407
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,836
<i>They've trapped me!</i>

408
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,382
<i>Win, Tadano, win!</i>

409
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,299
Augh!

410
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,177
<i>If I win, we'll get to see</i>
<i>Komi's kissy face.</i>

411
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,136
<i>No!</i>

412
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,348
<i>I can't put Komi through such trauma!</i>

413
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,141
<i>Komi! You've gotta say it!</i>

414
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,936
<i>Seven shoot!</i>

415
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,021
DOESN'T GET THE RULES

416
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>Oh no…</i>

417
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:19,528
<i>-Is there some other way I could lose?</i>
<i>-</i>Win already!

418
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,448
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

419
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,369
<i>I'd rather not, but I have no choice.</i>

420
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,955
E-Eight shoot.

421
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,584
Oh no! I said the wrong number!

422
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,836
I guess I lost!

423
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,801
<i>Kill me now.</i>

424
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,346
Class is starting.

425
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,681
Sorry Komi.

426
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,100
Let's play the Saito Game next time.

427
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,312
THE TWO RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS.

428
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,022
ARE YOU OKAY?

429
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,023
Ah.

430
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,483
Uh, yeah. I'm fine.

431
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,403
I just feel like I have a stomach ulcer.

432
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,325
Ow, ouchie…

433
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,120
Oh it hurts…

434
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,420
Huh?

435
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,923
THANK YOU. I HAD FUN.

436
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,216
Oh.

437
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,969
Oh good.

438
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,805
Tadano. Show me your kissy face later!

439
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,392
Ow, ow, ow.

440
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,846
