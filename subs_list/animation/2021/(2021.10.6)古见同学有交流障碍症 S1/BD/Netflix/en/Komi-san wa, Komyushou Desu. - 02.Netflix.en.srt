1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,056
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>Bear in mind,</i>
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

5
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,167
<i>The story so far.</i>

6
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:12,674
<i>Tadano's goal for high school</i>
<i>is to help Komi make 100 friends.</i>

7
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,759
MISSION 02
"IT'S JUST A CHILDHOOD FRIEND."

8
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,928
<i>I said I'd help, but Komi's so popular.</i>

9
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,972
<i>My job will be easy.</i>

10
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,225
<i>I'll approach my classmates saying…</i>

11
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,270
Komi says she wants friends.

12
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,772
Wow! I'll be her friend!

13
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,107
FLOAT…

14
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,233
POP!

15
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,986
<i>I've visualized it, now I can do it!</i>

16
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>So who…</i>

17
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,447
HA HA TEE-HEE

18
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>Oh!</i>

19
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,744
The new frappe at Standbakes
is super cute and yummy!

20
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,830
Yamai, have you tried it?

21
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,915
Of course! You gotta try it.

22
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,667
-Let's go together!
-Yeah!

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,335
Um, ah…

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,753
Yamai?

25
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,380
FREEZE

26
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,093
Huh? Yes, Tadano?

27
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,306
Uh, um, actually, about Komi…

28
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,807
Could you…

29
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,475
-Hee-hee.
-Huh?

30
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,522
Huh? You dare speak
the exalted one's name?

31
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,982
It's "Her Majesty," trashbag.

32
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,484
You just sit beside her.
You're still trash.

33
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,737
You're worthless,
yet breathe the same air.

34
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,698
Be grateful, trash. Trash, trash, trash…

35
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,741
Trash!

36
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,623
And?

37
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,544
Oh, uh, nothing.

38
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,839
Is that so? Okay, never talk to me again.

39
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,344
<i>Tadano was once again reminded</i>
<i>of his social position.</i>

40
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,349
LUNCH TIME

41
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,310
HE TRIED WITH SEVERAL OTHERS,
ONLY TO GET THE SAME RESULT.

42
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,771
<i>I'm…</i>

43
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,981
<i>friendless.</i>

44
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,109
<i>I told Komi I'd help her.</i>

45
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,363
<i>But I can't if I don't have any friends.</i>

46
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,950
<i>How conceited of me to say I'd help.</i>

47
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,534
<i>Sorry Komi.</i>

48
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,452
<i>I'm…</i>

49
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746
<i>useless.</i>

50
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,875
<i>But there's still one thing I can do.</i>

51
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,338
<i>I wanted to avoid doing this</i>
<i>if at all possible…</i>

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,550
<i>But there's someone Komi could</i>
<i>definitely be friends with.</i>

53
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,386
See ya later!

54
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,720
Bye!

55
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,725
O-Osana…

56
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,810
Huh?

57
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,436
Oh!

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,397
What's up all of a sudden?

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,985
Got business with your childhood friend,
Najimi Osana?

60
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,195
Tadano?

61
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,614
And Komi.

62
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,075
Where did you come from?

63
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,912
Uh, she's Najimi Osana.

64
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,415
-We went to junior high together.
-Yeah!

65
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,959
Huh? "She"?

66
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,419
Uh, you…

67
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,921
Why are you wearing a skirt?

68
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,383
What are you talking about, Tadano?

69
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,968
I'm a girl!

70
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,178
Of course I'm wearing a skirt!

71
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,806
-Or maybe it's Scottish tradi--
-No!

72
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,475
In junior high you always
wore a boy's uniform.

73
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,894
Huh? What? You've misunderstood!

74
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,648
-Tadano! That's just like you.
-No, I'm certain of it!

75
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,358
Hee-hee.

76
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,820
<i>Najimi Osana is just like that.</i>

77
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,239
<i>Uncertain gender.</i>

78
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,116
<i>Says one thing and does another.</i>

79
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,326
<i>Compulsive liar.</i>

80
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,618
<i>And above all…</i>

81
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,038
Najimi, did you see that TV show?

82
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,623
Oh, <i>Draining the River</i>?

83
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,835
Najimi! Want to check out
club activities with me?

84
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,504
Oh, sorry. How about tomorrow?

85
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,006
Okay!

86
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,425
Na-Najimi. Here's the book I borrowed.

87
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,886
Oh, <i>Jaysus</i> right? How was it?

88
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,473
Hey Najimi, don't say
the title in front of everyone.

89
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,059
<i>Yeah… What's really impressive…</i>

90
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,769
<i>are those people skills!</i>

91
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,353
Oh, that was really fresh!

92
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,814
KOMI'S SURPRISED.

93
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,193
Osana. Are all these people…

94
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,612
Huh? Yeah. My childhood friends.

95
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,529
<i>I knew it.</i>

96
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,992
I mean, all the students in the school
are my childhood friends.

97
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,203
VERY SURPRISED.

98
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,747
<i>That's how it was in junior high too.</i>

99
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,125
<i>Over half the students were</i>
<i>childhood friends of Osana's.</i>

100
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,337
<i>I heard it was because of</i>
<i>family circumstances.</i>

101
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,922
<i>But that's not it.</i>

102
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>What's unusual are those people skills.</i>

103
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,718
<i>Making friends in minutes.</i>

104
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,806
<i>And such a strong personality,</i>
<i>unforgettable after a single meeting.</i>

105
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,265
<i>It's a special power.</i>

106
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,477
<i>But that's exactly why…</i>

107
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,563
-See ya.
-Bye.

108
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,191
Osana. I need a favor.

109
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:44,904
A favor for my old buddy? Ask away.

110
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,866
-Can my body satisfy your carnal desires?
-Stop it, Komi's here.

111
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,744
Uh.

112
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,830
That's a joke.

113
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,291
Um.

114
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:02,880
This is who we're dealing with,
but Osana's not a bad person… I think…

115
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:08,094
If you're up for it, the phrase
we practiced this morning…

116
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,726
<i>Ah, she doesn't get it.</i>

117
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,022
"Let's be friends."

118
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,624
L…

119
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,585
L-L-L-L-L-L…

120
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,087
You're doing better than this morning!

121
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,089
What's going on? What is this?

122
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,593
She's saying, "Let's be friends."

123
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,510
MAYBE…

124
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,012
Really? Really??

125
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,265
That was the favor.

126
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,685
Would you be Komi's friend?

127
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,354
It'll be easy for you, right?

128
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,607
Oh, uh, I see.

129
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:07,278
Sorry. That's uh…

130
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,322
Not… possible.

131
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,209
FROZEN FROM SHOCK

132
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,503
Komi? Komi!

133
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,217
Osana. Get over here.

134
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,259
Okay!

135
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,352
What are you thinking?
Why did you turn her down?

136
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,812
You're the national champ
of people skills!

137
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,023
I wouldn't say national champ.

138
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,234
Hey, I'm sorry.

139
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,028
I'm just not into Komi.

140
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:49,946
Huh?

141
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,822
Is there such a person?

142
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,158
Who do you think she is?

143
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,746
I told you. I'm a childhood friend
of everyone here.

144
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,083
I've met Komi before.

145
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,042
Oh.

146
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,169
We were in second grade.

147
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,715
Komi!

148
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,134
You're going home?

149
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,345
Let's play a bit!

150
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,556
Hey Komi.

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,852
K-Komi?

152
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,148
Hey…

153
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,946
No matter what I said, she ignored me.

154
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,699
Komi's the only person
I couldn't befriend.

155
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,118
I was in bed for a week from the shock.

156
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,663
<i>So Komi has always been Komi.</i>

157
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,875
I'm a mature person,
so I won't say I hate her.

158
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,086
But when our eyes meet,

159
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,546
I get chills.

160
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,381
Oh… I see.

161
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,509
But you've misunderstood.

162
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,096
Komi didn't ignore you.
Just talk to her and you'll understand.

163
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,140
I know!

164
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,934
Could you walk home together? With Komi.

165
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,729
You're really aggressive, Tadano!

166
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,774
But I've already done what I can.

167
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,151
And it didn't work.

168
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,402
That's all.

169
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,238
Anyway, she's so popular.

170
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,157
She must have tons…

171
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,116
Oh.

172
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,952
Just talk to her.

173
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,083
What's this?
You're really pushing this Komi thing.

174
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,793
-You like her?
-Huh?

175
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:32,089
No way. She's out of my league.

176
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,007
It's just…

177
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,969
Komi needed help, so I just wanted to…

178
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,722
Is that weird?

179
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,931
OR TOO MEDDLESOME…?

180
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,433
Huh? No.

181
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,645
I just thought you're pretty cool.

182
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,647
-Makes me wet.
-Where?

183
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,399
Alright.

184
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,818
I'll walk home with Komi.

185
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,654
Osana.

186
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,572
-On one condition.
-Oh.

187
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,992
Stop calling me Osana.

188
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,536
We're old friends, right?

189
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,331
Call me Najimi like you used to.

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,251
Remember those days?

191
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,214
You wanted to ask that girl out.

192
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,133
So I helped you write "LOVE" on the field.

193
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,968
Stop that!

194
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,430
She really let you down hard.

195
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,141
<i>Childhood friends know your shameful past.</i>

196
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,059
Heh.

197
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,479
<i>That's why I didn't want to</i>
<i>resort to this.</i>

198
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,276
AFTER SCHOOL

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,946
MISSION 03
"I'M NOT A KILLER."

200
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,866
Want to walk home, Komi?

201
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,290
<i>So awkward…</i>

202
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,875
WALKING HOME
NAJIMI CAM

203
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,043
Sorry about before.

204
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,546
Saying I can't be your friend.

205
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,256
I didn't mean it.

206
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,762
Oh yeah!

207
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,683
You and I, we met before. Do you remember?

208
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,643
-…S!
-STARTLE!

209
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,520
Um… anyway.

210
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,398
You're v-very popular.

211
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,859
What's your secret?

212
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,570
RUMBLE

213
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,281
TREMBLE

214
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,242
<i>Are you alright?</i>

215
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,370
WALKING HOME
TADANO CAM

216
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,580
Sorry about before.

217
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,832
Saying I can't be your friend.

218
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,042
I didn't mean it.

219
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,005
TOO NERVOUS TO LOOK

220
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,214
Oh yeah!

221
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,218
You and I, we met before. Do you remember?

222
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,680
SHE DIDN'T PRONOUNCE
THE "YE," JUST THE "S."

223
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,599
Um… anyway.

224
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,226
You're v-very popular.

225
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,270
What's your secret?

226
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,981
REALLY WANTS TO DENY IT

227
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,319
<i>Are you alright?</i>

228
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,445
I GIVE UP

229
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,906
<i>Not even Najimi can talk to her.</i>

230
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,241
Najimi!

231
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,621
Heh heh.

232
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,333
I found you, Najimi.

233
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,043
-Heh.
-Oh!

234
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,420
It's Maa and Shii!

235
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,838
What are you doing here?

236
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,092
You just moved away
without saying anything!

237
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,221
Maa misses you, Najimi!

238
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,265
<i>They're Najimi's friends!</i>
<i>That was unexpected.</i>

239
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,975
Yeah?

240
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,977
What's up?

241
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,395
Oh yeah.

242
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:34,939
Yeah!

243
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,357
Listen.

244
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,901
I realized this after you left.

245
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,988
You mean so much to me.

246
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,615
Maa, you can do it!

247
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,991
Najimi.

248
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,576
Please go out with me!

249
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,203
No. Anyway I'm a dude.

250
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,329
<i>That was fast.</i>

251
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,539
WHICH ARE YOU…

252
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,419
-Najimi.
-Yeah?

253
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,880
I've made up my mind.

254
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,798
Huh?

255
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,635
I'm going to trust my heart!

256
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,512
-Maa!
-<i>He's in deep…</i>

257
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,139
HEH HEH HEH

258
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,683
SHOULD I HELP…?

259
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,061
Ow! Let me go!

260
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,730
I won't let you get away again.

261
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,232
Huh?

262
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,942
RUMBLE

263
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,236
<i>What's this pressure I'm feeling?</i>

264
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,779
Huh?

265
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,450
<i>Oh, a chick. She's hot, too!</i>

266
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,035
What is it?

267
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,955
<i>Huh? My house key?</i>

268
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,793
I…

269
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,588
key… you…

270
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,797
Guurgh!

271
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,551
<i>She just said, "I'll kill you."</i>
<i>Didn't she?</i>

272
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,553
<i>What's going on?</i>

273
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,762
<i>S-Surely not…</i>

274
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,182
Last time someone did that to Najimi
I killed him!

275
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,435
With his own house key!

276
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,228
<i>That's what she's saying!</i>

277
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,438
Eek!

278
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:03,152
STARE

279
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,196
-L-Let's go, Shii!
-Maa! Wait up!

280
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,409
SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY,
"I FOUND THIS KEY OF YOURS."

281
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,036
Uh.

282
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,171
It's alright, Komi!

283
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,841
I think they just misunderstood.

284
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,553
I'll be your friend, Komi.

285
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,638
Whoa.

286
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,806
Uh.

287
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:34,975
Hah!

288
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,400
Komi, you're hilarious.

289
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,694
I had you all wrong.

290
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,699
Let's go.

291
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,623
You made your second friend.

292
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,294
Huh?

293
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,058
What should we do with this?

294
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,476
KEY

295
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,894
<i>They took it to the police.</i>

296
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,730
<i>She spoke to a stranger!</i>

297
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,900
<i>Komi, you're growing up!</i>

298
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,902
MISSION 04
"IT'S JUST MY FIRST ERRAND."

299
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,904
LUNCH TIME

300
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,162
Hey, Komi!

301
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,749
Do you want to eat lunch together?

302
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,924
NAJIMI FULL OF FEAR
KOMI FULL OF JOY

303
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,427
<i>They still have a long way to go.</i>

304
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:53,887
Huh?

305
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,432
Oh, it's you, Tadano.

306
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,392
Are you eating alone?

307
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,309
GULP!

308
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,602
Did you know?

309
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,105
Food tastes better
if you eat with someone!

310
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,815
I eat with my friends.

311
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,567
What about you?

312
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,945
Must I do everything for you?

313
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,489
If you insist, you can eat with us.

314
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,615
SLIGHTLY HAPPY

315
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,492
What are you thinking?

316
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,370
Eating with Her Majesty?
Of course you can't.

317
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,039
Her Majesty's lunch is sacred.

318
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,791
-Being in her sight is unacceptable.
-No thanks.

319
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,046
Anyway, Komi.
Why did you want to be friends?

320
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,505
You want more friends?

321
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,549
This cream went on sale yesterday.

322
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,967
What shampoo do you use?

323
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,011
What do you think of Tadano?

324
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,304
That looks tasty!

325
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,513
Did you make it?

326
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,973
Yesterday at the store…

327
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,725
What music do you like? I like…

328
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,268
TALK TALK TALK

329
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,729
INFORMATION OVERLOAD

330
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,565
Komi wants to make a hundred friends.

331
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,734
A hundred…

332
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,612
That's all?

333
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,364
<i>Don't say that!</i>

334
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,326
Ah, alright.

335
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,286
<i>What are you scheming?</i>

336
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,246
Oh, Komi.

337
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,457
You know…

338
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,668
I feel a little thirsty.

339
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,213
Get me a Standbakes non-fat milk pistachio

340
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,964
deep mocha dip cream frappaccino,

341
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,634
medium with chocolate sauce
and extra whip.

342
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,011
If you don't, I won't be your friend.

343
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,221
Wha?!

344
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,305
STAGGER

345
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,432
Komi, you're going?

346
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,309
See ya!

347
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,562
Najimi! That's coercion!

348
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,022
It's fine. It's nearby.

349
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,483
That's not what I meant.

350
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,567
Huh.

351
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,861
I did it for her sake.

352
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,321
It hurts me more.

353
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,948
Asking for a non-fat milk pistachio--

354
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,324
You don't need to say it.

355
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,493
It's training for Komi.

356
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,953
To talk to people.

357
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,038
I don't actually need the drink.

358
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,790
You're clearly enjoying this.

359
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,918
What are you standing around for?

360
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,753
You've got to follow her.

361
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,338
Just don't blow your cover.

362
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,756
You're not coming?

363
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,092
I'm on a tight schedule.

364
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,428
I've got three other lunch dates today.

365
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,973
Who are you?

366
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,269
STRANGER DANGER!!
