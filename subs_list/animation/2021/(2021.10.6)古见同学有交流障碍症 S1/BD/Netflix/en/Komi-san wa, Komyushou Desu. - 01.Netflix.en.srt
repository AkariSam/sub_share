00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,068
<i>A well-known prep school.</i>

6
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,364
<i>I've always been average,</i>

7
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>but I got into this school.</i>

8
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,203

<i>to read the room and</i>
<i>not make waves in high school!</i>

00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,087
<i>That's all I need.</i>

12
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,547
<i>That's all I want!</i>

13
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,424
<i>Tadano is a coward.</i>

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,302
<i>One thing I know,</i>

15
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,597
<i>is reading the room and not standing out</i>

16
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>is the way to happiness.</i>

17
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,439
<i>It's not like I stood out in junior high.</i>

18
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,734
<i>It's not like I made a fool of myself.</i>
<i>Not at all!</i>

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,071
<i>Um… greetings are important.</i>

<i>I feel like there's a target on me.</i>

53
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,140

Let's have a great year.

My specialty is reading the room.

00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,310
Just kidding.

00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,853

First, gym clothes.

87
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,584
Make sure you write your name on them.

88
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,753

Ah!

168
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,893
I REALLY DO WANT TO SPEAK.

169
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,773
MY FACE FREEZES AROUND PEOPLE.

00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,817
I GUESS I'M SCARED, BUT I WANT TO SPEAK.

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,319
Oh…

172
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,779
BUT WHEN I APPROACH PEOPLE,
THEY GET NERVOUS.

173
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,740
SOME FAINT OR EVEN COWER IN DIRT.

174
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,949
I THINK THEY HATE ME.

00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,662
-NO, I KNOW THEY HATE ME.
-<i>There's been a huge misunderstanding.</i>

WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH,

177
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,925
IT WAS SO HARD, ESPECIALLY DURING LUNCH.

178
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,218
I HATED EATING ALONE.

179
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,720
EVERYONE WOULD CHAT AND EAT.

180
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,804
I WAS SO LONELY.

181
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,931
I TRIED TO TALK EVERY DAY
FOR THREE YEARS.

182
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,309
BUT MY VOICE WOULDN'T COME OUT.

183
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,020
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED.

184
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,981
I COULDN'T TALK TO ANYONE.

185
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,441
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

186
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,153
HOW CAN I TALK?
WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER THAT?

187
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,615
WHAT IF THEY REJECT ME?
WHAT SHOULD I SAY NEXT?

188
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,326
WHAT IF THEY SAY I'M BORING?

189
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,286
IF I CAN'T SMILE RIGHT, THEN WHAT?

190
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,287
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

191
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,664
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

192
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,724
I WANTED TO ASK YOU TO EAT LUNCH WITH ME.

193
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:29,688
<i>She went through so much,</i>
<i>just trying to say one thing.</i>

194
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:34,735
<i>Komi isn't hard to talk to,</i>
<i>nor hard to approach.</i>

195
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,822
You can use this.

196
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,948
<i>She's just…</i>

197
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,075
<i>a regular gir--</i>

198
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,077
-I JUST HAVE HICCUPS.
-Huh?

199
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,707
Did your hiccups stop?

200
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,584
YES, THANKS.

201
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,669
No problem.

202
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,597
I CAN'T EVEN SAY GOOD MORNING.

203
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,809
EVERYONE ELSE CAN DO IT. BUT I CAN'T.

204
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,103
FUN THINGS. HAPPY THINGS.

205
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,397
TALKING ABOUT MISTAKES. STUDYING.
LAST NIGHT'S TV SHOW.

206
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,774
I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER.

207
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,734
I'M SORRY.

208
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,947
-I'M SORRY I BOTHERED YOU, TADANO.
<i>-Tadano!</i>

209
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,907
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

210
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,870
Huh? Were you bothering me?

211
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,707
ANYWAY.

212
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,292
<i>She dropped it.</i>

213
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,254
I THOUGHT I SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

214
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,466
I'M SORRY.

215
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,638
I'M SORRY I WROTE SO MUCH.

216
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:49,101
GO AHEAD AND FORGET
WHAT YOU SAW HERE TODAY.

217
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:13,792
GOODBYE.

218
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,626
ISN'T THE WEATHER NICE TODAY?

219
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,355
YES.

220
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,615
TRY WRITING MORE.

221
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,207
THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS WERE PRETTY.

222
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,668
IT'S OKAY. RELAX.

223
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,488
SHOOTING STAR

224
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,189
WHAT'S YOUR DREAM, KOMI?

225
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,192
I WANT TO MAKE 100 FRIENDS.

226
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,027
PLEASE DON'T LAUGH.

227
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,202
I'LL BE YOUR FIRST FRIEND,
AND I'LL HELP YOU FIND THE OTHER 99.

228
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,706
JOLT

229
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,461
BLUSH

230
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,422
ERASE ERASE

231
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,766
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

232
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,354
HUH?

233
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,073
DASH

234
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,741
Hey, Komi!

235
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,703
POP!

236
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:41,166
<i>This is how my abnormal</i>
<i>high school life began.</i>

237
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,627
<i>My goal?</i>

238
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,630
<i>To help Komi, someone who</i>
<i>isn't good at talking to people…</i>

239
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
<i>Oh.</i>

240
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,761
<i>"Someone who isn't good at</i>
<i>talking to people" is so long.</i>

241
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,056
<i>Not good with people…</i>

242
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,018
<i>Difficulty communicating…</i>

243
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,728
<i>Communicate…</i>

244
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,812
<i>Oh!</i>

245
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,981
<i>My goal.</i>

246
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:09,236
<i>To help Komi who can't communicate</i>
<i>make 99 friends!</i>

247
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,492
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

248
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,328
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

249
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,708
<i>Bear in mind, they only</i>
<i>struggle to form connections.</i>

250
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,295
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

251
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,154
THE NEXT DAY

252
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,322
Good morning.

253
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,326
<i>One thing I know,</i>

254
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,621
<i>is that Komi is beautiful.</i>

255
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,586
<i>Of all the people I've seen,</i>
<i>she's definitely the prettiest.</i>

256
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,839
<i>Her skin is pure white.</i>

257
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,091
<i>Her eyes are big and almond-shaped.</i>

258
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,301
<i>Her hair is smooth.</i>

259
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,971
<i>She smells good.</i>

260
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,890
<i>It's like she gleams.</i>

261
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,517
Komi!

262
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,853
I mean…

263
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,605
Good morning, Komi.

264
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,116
G-Good…

265
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,827
TREMBLE

266
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,121
Um.

267
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:29,251
We've got to start
with some vocal exercises.

268
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,298
Try saying, "Let's be friends."

269
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,509
If you can say that,
you'll have 100 friends in no time.

270
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,355
PETRIFIED KOMI

271
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,481
Komi?

272
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,067
<i>One thing I know,</i>

273
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,905
<i>is that Komi can't communicate well.</i>

274
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,698
<i>Not only that.</i>

275
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,870
<i>She really wants to talk to people.</i>

276
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,371
<i>I know that too.</i>

277
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,542
<i>And that Komi…</i>

278
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,794
Okay, one more time.

279
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,589
<i>…is my friend.</i>

280
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,969
<i>But Tadano has missed something.</i>

281
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,014
<i>Their school, Itan Private High School.</i>

282
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,936
<i>Though it's a famous prep school,</i>
<i>entrance is based on interviews alone.</i>

283
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,396
<i>To pass, students must be unique.</i>

284
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,981
<i>Yes, it's full of…</i>

285
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,026
<i>freaks,</i>

286
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,444
<i>weirdos,</i>

287
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,528
<i>loners,</i>

288
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,905
<i>miscreants,</i>

289
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,784
<i>and eccentrics.</i>

290
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,745
<i>Tadano hasn't yet realized</i>

291
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,624
<i>how difficult it's going to be…</i>

292
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,962
<i>for Komi to make friends at this school.</i>

293
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,965
Oh!

294
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,995
BONUS SCENE

295
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,207
"She was very beautiful."

296
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,127
"Her milk-like skin
glowed in the room light

297
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,421
with a reddish tinge."

298
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,927
"Her long, delicate arms and legs
didn't seem to be from a life in poverty."

299
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,388
"Shortly after the old woman
left the room,

300
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,517
the girl spoke with a slight accent."

301
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,436
Alright, now continue.

302
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,938
Komi.

303
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,231
Whoa.

304
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,952
Yes! You're so right!

305
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,288
What's the point of reading aloud?
There is none!

306
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,457
Alright, everyone read silently!

307
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,501
KOMI WAS JUST
TOO SHY TO SPEAK.

308
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,878
Action!

309
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,926
-Hey Komi!
-Your notebook!

310
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,844
-Yeah!
-Good!

311
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,761
THE END
