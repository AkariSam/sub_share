1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:03,545
Up. Down.

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:04,963
Left.

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,381
Alright.

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,757
Next, Osana.

5
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,718
Right!

6
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,678
D-Down!

7
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,638
Left?

8
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,765
Okay, next!

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:21,271
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,865
-POINT…
-STARTLE!

12
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,952
<i>Bear in mind,</i>
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

13
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

14
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,802
<i>Komi is the prettiest,</i>
<i>most admired girl in class.</i>

15
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,053
<i>Plus, she's a god.</i>

16
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,722
<i>She enraptures with her beauty,</i>

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,850
<i>bringing joy to us commoners.</i>

18
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,061
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,397
My name is Makeru Yadano.

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,859
I'm just a humble subject,
but I have a little goal today.

21
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,610
<i>That is…</i>

22
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,906
<i>to beat Komi</i>
<i>at the physical exam.</i>

23
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>Someone is giving Komi</i>
<i>a death glare.</i>

24
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,955
<i>This physical exam has four parts.</i>

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>Vision, height, weight, seated height.</i>

26
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:51,629
<i>If I can win three or more,</i>
<i>I'll be victorious!</i>

27
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>I'll beat the most superior being</i>
<i>in our class.</i>

28
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,969
<i>It would be my greatest achievement.</i>

29
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,929
<i>But what's this?</i>

30
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,807
<i>She's not answering at all.</i>

31
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,893
<i>I was unsure about the vision test,</i>

32
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,644
<i>but it may be an easy win!</i>

33
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,648
Komi, your eyesight's above average.

34
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,066
CAN'T SEE KOMI POINTING

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,526
<i>What's up with that?</i>

36
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,487
-<i>Komi wasn't even answering.</i>
-Y-Yadano?

37
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,241
<i>Could it be, Komi…</i>

38
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,660
<i>bribed the examiner?</i>

39
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,371
<i>Unacceptable!</i>

40
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,335
-<i>You'd play dirty poker just to beat me?</i>
-Hey, ow. That hurts, Yadano.

41
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,882
<i>Fine then. I'll play fair and square.</i>

42
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,384
<i>And I'll beat you!</i>

43
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,594
BELOW AVERAGE EYESIGHT

44
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,138
<i>You lose!</i>

45
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,515
HEIGHT

46
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,725
WEIGHT

47
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,684
SEATED HEIGHT

48
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,437
<i>Alright, it's all measured.</i>

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,148
<i>It's on… It's so on, Komi!</i>

50
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,108
ROUND 2 - HEIGHT
KOMI: 168 CM

51
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,109
YADANO: 156 CM

52
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,028
<i>Looks like I can't win this one.</i>

53
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,113
<i>It's fine as long as I don't lose.</i>

54
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,157
<i>Mine is higher!</i>

55
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>Yay! It's a tie…</i>

56
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,789
<i>It's weight and seated height!</i>

57
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,415
<i>What does that mean?</i>

58
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,753
<i>I'm shorter, but my seated height</i>
<i>and weight are both higher?</i>

59
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,463
<i>Hang on a minute.</i>

60
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,175
<i>Who decided that it's better</i>
<i>for those to be lower?</i>

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,344
<i>In harsh lands like the savanna,</i>

62
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,139
<i>people who can store fat</i>
<i>are the winners in a food crisis.</i>

63
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,099
<i>Seated height?</i>

64
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,103
<i>There must be a place where</i>
<i>they love short-legged women!</i>

65
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,604
<i>That's right!</i>

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,526
<i>It's a tie, Komi.</i>

67
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,739
<i>Incidentally, Tadano</i>
<i>was average in every category.</i>

68
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,491
NO POINT MEASURING THE OBVIOUS.

69
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,451
MISSION 11
"IT'S JUST A CRUSH."

70
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,620
<i>My name is Hitohito Tadano.</i>

71
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,414
<i>I'm an ordinary high schooler.</i>

72
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>One extraordinary thing?</i>

73
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,752
<i>I'm friends with</i>
<i>the prettiest girl in schoo--</i>

74
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,049
<i>My name is Ren Yamai.</i>

75
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,718
<i>I'm an ordinary high schooler.</i>

76
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,053
<i>How ordinary, you ask?</i>

77
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,723
<i>I don't like studying, but I love fashion!</i>

78
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,640
Good morning!

79
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:12,103
<i>I've got my worries,</i>
<i>but I have lots of friends and I'm happy!</i>

80
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,688
<i>That's ordinary, right?</i>

81
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,566
<i>And right now…</i>

82
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,821
<i>I have a little crush.</i>

83
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,489
BA-BUMP…

84
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,201
<i>Komi walking.</i>

85
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,661
<i>Komi kneeling.</i>

86
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,621
<i>Komi standing.</i>

87
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,582
<i>Komi going upstairs.</i>

88
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,210
<i>Komi, Komi, Komi…</i>

89
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,921
TWITCHING

90
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,381
Oh.

91
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,926
<i>Komi's so beautiful I lost myself.</i>

92
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,344
<i>Get it together!</i>

93
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,931
<i>I can't stare too much or it'll be rude.</i>

94
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,809
<i>Ah, traces of Komi's aroma.</i>

95
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,979
<i>This color, shine, scent.</i>

96
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,690
<i>There's no mistaking it.</i>
<i>This is Komi's hair!</i>

97
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:04,363
<i>Today I'll make her mine.</i>

98
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,406
<i>No.</i>

99
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,824
<i>I hope we can be friends.</i>

100
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,285
<i>Calm down.</i>

101
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,454
<i>Chill out, Ren Yamai.</i>

102
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,499
<i>Smile and greet her</i>
<i>and you'll be one step closer.</i>

103
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,583
<i>Alright!</i>

104
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,877
-Good morning, Kom--
-K-Komi!

105
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,961
Good morning!

106
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,671
AGARI IS KOMI'S DOG.

107
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,257
Oh no! I'm sorry.

108
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,384
Y-Your dog shouldn't speak to you.

109
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,775
I-I'll be going!

110
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,901
<i>What's up with her?</i>

111
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,404
<i>How could such an embarrassment</i>
<i>speak to our holiness?</i>

112
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,661
<i>I've got to pull myself together.</i>

113
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,746
-Komi, Good mo--
-Morning!

114
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,457
Hey, did you see the moon last night?

115
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,251
It was so pink!

116
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,585
And you know what?

117
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,503
Huh?

118
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,712
Oh, Yamai.

119
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,798
Morning!

120
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh, Najimi. Good morning.

121
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,593
Ever the little chatterbox.

122
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,178
Chatterbox?

123
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,806
Komi, good morning.

124
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,516
<i>Yeah! I did it!</i>

125
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,686
<i>I was interrupted</i>
<i>but I greeted Her Majesty!</i>

126
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,604
CREAK

127
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,940
Oh my.

128
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,025
Oh, Yamai. You know…

129
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,361
Komi's so perfect!

130
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,988
Huh?

131
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,948
<i>I feel so reassured.</i>

132
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,032
<i>Of course!</i>

133
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,785
<i>I, a commoner,</i>
<i>spoke casually to Her Majesty.</i>

134
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:37,457
<i>If Her Majesty replied,</i>
<i>she'd be selling herself short.</i>

135
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,751
<i>She ignored me and that makes me so happy!</i>

136
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,669
Yamai?

137
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,629
Najimi. Come here.

138
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,340
Huh?

139
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,181
I've been wanting to ask you,
what's your relationship with Komi?

140
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,809
-Yamai, this isn't your usual--
-Just answer the question.

141
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,311
W-We're just friends.

142
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,647
Oops, I sneezed.

143
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,608
<i>As if! Are you kidding me?</i>

144
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,568
Najimi.

145
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,113
We're friends, right?

146
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,451
So of course you'll introduce
me to Komi, won't you?

147
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,536
<i>She may kill me if I turn her down.</i>

148
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,831
Anyway, this is Ren Yamai.

149
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:23,044
We played those games, remember?
I'm Ren Yamai. Nice to meet you.

150
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,881
TREMBLE

151
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,798
Wha…

152
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,801
RATTLE

153
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,887
<i>I can't handle this!</i>

154
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,097
<i>Her big, soulful eyes.</i>

155
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,599
<i>Her shiny hair.</i>

156
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,434
<i>Her quivering gestures.</i>

157
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,770
<i>She's like a cute little chihuahua!</i>

158
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:45,024
<i>I want to touch her!</i>
<i>Stroke her, lick her, date her!</i>

159
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,735
<i>But I can't! Her Majesty is holy!</i>

160
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,905
<i>Patience… Patience Ren Yamai!</i>

161
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,073
<i>Not yet.</i>

162
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,951
What's making Yamai do this?

163
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,161
<i>Act normal.</i>

164
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,122
<i>Just act normal. Ren Yamai.</i>

165
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,376
Hey Komi. Do you like Hamburg steak?

166
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,254
I made too much today for my lunch.

167
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,882
Could you help me out by eating some?

168
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,010
<i>It's my patented</i>
<i>Indirect Lunch Invitation!</i>

169
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,096
<i>Of course I made the food myself.</i>

170
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,848
<i>I mixed the raw meat with my bare hands!</i>

171
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,271
TADANO'S DESK

172
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,815
You can do it!

173
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,248
Yeaaaah!

174
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,167
Oh!

175
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,837
Oh, sorry. That was nothing.

176
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,132
I mean it wasn't nothing. I'm just happy.

177
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,718
So happy.

178
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,973
Homeroom is starting.

179
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,142
I'll see you later, Komi.

180
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,686
TREMBLE

181
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,645
Yikes!

182
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,939
What is happening?

183
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,610
Oh, is Tadano absent today?

184
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,074
<i>When Tadano's not here,</i>
<i>I don't know what Komi is thinking!</i>

185
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,535
<i>Where are you, Tadano?!</i>

186
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,504
<i>Where am I?</i>

187
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,178
<i>What is this place?</i>

188
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,639
<i>There's photos of Komi everywhere.</i>

189
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,059
<i>A photocollage?</i>

190
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,271
<i>This must be Yamai's room.</i>

191
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,234
<i>What's going to happen to me?!</i>

192
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,944
<i>Someone!</i>

193
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,949
Yamai!

194
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,910
Can I go to your house today?

195
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,871
Why so sudden?

196
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:08,417
Well, you won't leave Tadano's seat
even though lunch is over.

197
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,212
I figured you wanted to talk.

198
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,214
<i>Yes.</i>

199
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,424
<i>I don't want to leave Komi's side.</i>

200
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,887
<i>It was so fun spending lunch with Komi.</i>

201
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,972
<i>We got to talk so much.</i>

202
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,932
KOMI WAS SILENT.

203
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,893
<i>It was the best moment of my life.</i>

204
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,647
I don't want to lose this moment.

205
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,857
Is that so wrong?!

206
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,069
Of course, Komi will come too.

207
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,404
Huh?!

208
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,364
<i>K-Komi?</i>

209
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,699
<i>In my room?</i>

210
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,078
<i>That means her scent</i>
<i>will get on my bed and cushions?</i>

211
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,789
Sure, of course…

212
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,960
<i>Oh right, that thing's at my place.</i>

213
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,295
<i>What should I do?</i>

214
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,672
<i>Komi…</i>

215
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,132
<i>That thing…</i>

216
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,383
<i>Komi…</i>

217
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,802
<i>Komi…</i>

218
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,097
Sure, of course it's fine!

219
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,558
<i>Komi won by a landslide.</i>

220
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,104
<i>It's already evening.</i>

221
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

222
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,444
My room is a mess. Just wait here.

223
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,029
Alright. Sorry for the sudden visit.

224
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,699
<i>She's coming!</i>

225
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,037
<i>Yikes!</i>

226
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,043
<i>I'm dead…</i>

227
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,962
PASS

228
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,384
Which do you prefer, the woods or the sea?

229
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,345
Th-The woods?

230
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,014
I see.

231
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,517
That's where I'll bury you then.

232
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,643
<i>In the woods?</i>

233
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:54,148
Yamai, are you done?

234
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,108
Almost!

235
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,694
My special person is coming.

236
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,279
If you scream I'll bury…

237
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,407
Well, if you don't scream
I won't bury you.

238
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,325
Okay?

239
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,535
<i>Seems like I'm dead either way.</i>

240
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,040
Alright, come on in!

241
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,459
Go on and rub your scent on everything!

242
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,294
Scent?

243
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,046
<i>Is that Najimi's voice?</i>

244
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,923
<i>It's Najimi!</i>

245
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,217
<i>Najimi! Help me!</i>

246
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,429
Ahaha sorry. The neighbors are so loud.

247
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,181
<i>She's unphased!</i>

248
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,894
What a wild neighbor.

249
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,897
I'll kill you, got it? Stay quiet.

250
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,358
The woods are nearby. Shut up and obey.

251
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,610
Ha-ha. Don't worry about that.

252
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,695
<i>How can I not?!</i>

253
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,406
I'll go make some tea. Wait here.

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,617
Is jasmine tea alright?

255
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,868
Uh, sure.

256
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,874
Don't open the closet.

257
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,877
Uh, sure.

258
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,755
NAJIMI OPENS IT IMMEDIATELY.

259
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,722
Sorry. Are we interrupting something?

260
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,683
SOME KIND OF KINK?

261
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,102
Oh. You saw.

262
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:19,275
Don't misunderstand, Komi.

263
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,404
It's not like I took out Tadano
to get close to you.

264
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,365
-<i>Cooking chopsticks!</i>
-<i>They've been sharpened!</i>

265
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,868
It's for Komi's sake.

266
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,327
Right?

267
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,164
You're not smart or handsome.
Your height and build are average.

268
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,877
You're not that funny
and your features are plain.

269
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,838
All you've got is
that crappy hairstyle, Trashboy.

270
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,757
It doesn't make sense
for you to be near Komi.

271
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,051
<i>It hurts to be reminded.</i>

272
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,262
Right, Komi?

273
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,723
You agree, don't you?

274
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,266
After all…

275
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,520
You're pretty, shapely, and classy
and have a good personality,

276
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,940
and for some reason
it doesn't make me jealous.

277
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,902
You complete me.

278
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,862
Why should royalty like you

279
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,991
be with the lowest rung
of the school caste system?

280
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,534
Don't you agree, Komi?

281
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,162
You'd be happier
with more popular friends.

282
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,039
So you don't need Tadano.

283
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,540
You need me.

284
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,585
I've worked hard so everyone will like me.

285
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,670
To be friends with you.

286
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,963
See?

287
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,551
I'm the ideal friend for you, Komi.

288
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,763
You want to be my friend, don't you?

289
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,643
Right? Komi.

290
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,567
Huh?

291
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,452
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.

292
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,453
<i>So polite.</i>

293
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,624
W-Wait…

294
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,834
Wait, Komi!

295
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,294
I…

296
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,255
I did it all for you!

297
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,971
LOOKS FOR A PLACE TO WRITE

298
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,181
USES THE FLOOR

299
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,108
I CHOOSE MY OWN FRIENDS.

300
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:42,751
She won't even speak to me.

301
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,380
She hates me.

302
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,846
<i>What should I do?</i>

303
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,849
<i>Tadano!</i>

304
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,809
THE NEXT DAY

305
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>I feel like I forgot something.</i>

306
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,898
Whatever.

307
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,865
<i>Komi's background!</i>

308
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,535
<i>Is she angry?</i>

309
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,662
Komi?

310
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,622
WE NEED TO TALK.

311
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>I guess she really is angry at me?!</i>

312
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,466
Um…

313
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,178
Komi? You wanted to talk?

314
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,848
CREAK

315
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,560
<i>I usually know what she's thinking,</i>
<i>but not now!</i>

316
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,731
I'M NOT SURE IF I SHOULD BE YOUR FRIEND.

317
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,692
What does that mean?

318
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,905
YESTERDAY, YOU WENT THROUGH
SOMETHING AWFUL.

319
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,866
Yeah, that's true.

320
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,620
YAMAI SAID SHE DID IT FOR ME.

321
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,622
THIS IS EVERYTHING YAMAI SAID.

322
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,583
<i>She remembers everything? Wow!</i>

323
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,548
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. I PUT YOU IN DANGER.

324
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,674
That's not tru--

325
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,592
YES IT IS.

326
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,510
<i>So fast!</i>

327
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,189
WHAT IF WE NEVER FOUND YOU IN THAT ROOM?

328
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,150
WHAT IF SOMETHING WORSE HAPPENED?

329
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,111
WHAT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN?

330
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,821
BECAUSE OF ME.

331
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,405
SO I…

332
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,369
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE YOUR FRIEND.

333
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,711
Oh.

334
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,257
Okay. I understand.

335
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,055
But listen, Komi.

336
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,935
I choose my own friends.

337
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,360
BLUSH

338
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,405
Um, no, not like that!

339
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,073
It's just, you know.

340
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,200
It's like what you said yesterday.

341
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,661
I wasn't trying to sound cool.

342
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,204
It just popped out.

343
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,248
I wasn't trying to act cool.

344
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,791
Just forget about it!

345
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,170
I know I'm super awkward.

346
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,177
I'M SORRY.

347
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,138
<i>Sorry about what?</i>

348
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,601
I…

349
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,022
I…

350
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,777
I do…

351
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,447
want…

352
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,657
to…

353
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,493
to…

354
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,995
be…

355
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,664
f-friends…

356
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,209
with…

357
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:12,920
you.

358
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,886
Yes.

359
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,013
Thank you so…

360
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,973
Huh? Uh. Um…

361
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,559
Um, I also

362
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,102
want to be friends with--

363
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,312
There you are!

364
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,398
I've been looking for you!

365
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,150
Come here!

366
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,821
Yamai wants to apologize.

367
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,240
To Tadano.

368
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,033
Huh? To me?

369
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,787
Um, Tadano…

370
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,413
About yesterday…

371
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,415
I'm sorry!

372
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,960
I went too far.

373
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,672
I should have just threatened you
to shut you up.

374
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,383
I'm sorry I said such terrible things.

375
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,678
That was how I felt,
but I shouldn't have said them.

376
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,348
I truly regret it. I'm sorry!

377
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,393
<i>She sucks at apologizing.</i>

378
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,937
I'm sorry to you too, Komi.

379
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,232
It was presumptuous of me.

380
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:19,319
It's not for me to decide
who should be your friend.

381
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:25,200
This all happened
because of my selfishness.

382
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,286
It'll never happen again. I'm sorry!

383
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,913
Uh, okay.

384
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,333
ALRIGHT.

385
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,212
<i>I guess you still…</i>

386
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,215
You still refuse to speak to me!

387
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,135
A life where Komi won't speak to me

388
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,970
is not a life worth living!

389
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,680
<i>Where'd she get the chopstick?!</i>

390
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,850
-Don't be so hasty!
-Let me go, Najimi!

391
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,936
Can I tell her about you?

392
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,895
NOD

393
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,356
Yamai!

394
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,900
Komi is just bad at talking to people.

395
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,819
She's got bad communication skills!

396
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,904
Don't be ridiculous!

397
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,073
Stop badmouthing Komi.

398
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,243
THEY EXPLAINED THOROUGHLY.

399
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,203
What…

400
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,999
So it was all a misunderstanding?

401
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,669
I can't believe it.

402
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,214
I love that Komi has such a cute side!

403
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,132
Huh?

404
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,926
You want to make 100 friends?

405
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,973
Komi you're adorable!

406
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,559
<i>Nobody can stop Yamai.</i>

407
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:37,022
Gosh, 100 friends.

408
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,025
GLANCE…

409
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,653
Peek.

410
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,739
<i>She just said "peek."</i>

411
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,199
WANTS TO BE FRIENDS!

412
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,368
What do you
want to do, Komi?

413
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,373
KOMI'S UNSURE!

414
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,833
<i>Understandable.</i>

415
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,759
L-LET'S BE FRIENDS.

416
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,387
Yes! A thousand times yes!

417
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:15,977
FANTASY

418
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,945
-I'LL DIE IF KOMI HATES ME!
-THERE, THERE. WE'LL APOLOGIZE TOMORROW.

419
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,967
If you touch Komi I'll bury you.

420
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,052
<i>Yamai is obsessed.</i>

421
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,971
