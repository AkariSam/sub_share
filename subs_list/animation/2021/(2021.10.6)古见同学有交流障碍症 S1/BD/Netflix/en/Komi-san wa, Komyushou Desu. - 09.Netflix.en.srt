<i>September 1st.</i>

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,257
<i>The first day back after summer break</i>

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,843
<i>is a depressing one for many students.</i>

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,265
<i>Be it despair over the end of summer,</i>
<i>or unease about their environment,</i>

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,769
<i>the cause is not certain,</i>
<i>but here's what Tadano thought…</i>

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,818
-OH MY GOSH, IT'S KOMI…
-<i>"The kids here seem just fine."</i>

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,319
-IT'S BEEN FOREVER…
-LOOK AT ME…

8
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,613
GLOOM

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,115
<i>What a bummer.</i>

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>My name is Nokoko Inaka.</i>

11
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,454
<i>When I…</i>

12
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>When I think about being back at school,</i>
<i>my chest tightens.</i>

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,296
<i>Nobody knows my secret…</i>
<i>They don't know I'm a…</i>

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,716
<i>I'm a…</i>

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,801
<i>a country bumpkin!</i>

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,970
INAKA IS A COUNTRY GIRL.

17
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,938
MISSION 29
"I'M JUST A COUNTRY GIRL."

18
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,108
<i>First semester was so darn tough.</i>

19
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,403
<i>If my secret gets out,</i>
<i>they'll throw rocks at me!</i>

20
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,574
<i>Everyone else was having fun,</i>
<i>but I stayed quiet by myself.</i>

21
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,326
<i>Everyone made their skirts so short.</i>

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,579
<i>But mine was 5 cm below my knees.</i>

23
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,081
<i>I can't pull off a short skirt.</i>

24
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,002
<i>But I'm different today!</i>

25
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,256
<i>I raised my skirt to 3 cm below my knees!</i>

26
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,718
<i>It's my fall semester glow up!</i>

27
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,807
<i>I'm so embarrassed.</i>

28
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,310
<i>What a bummer.</i>

29
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,854
<i>Why am I so…</i>

30
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,901
<i>That's the god of our class, Komi!</i>

31
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,112
<i>Wow. Beautiful as usual.</i>

32
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,656
<i>She's a real city girl.</i>

33
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,824
CITY GIRL

34
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>I wish I could be like Komi.</i>

35
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:26,414
<i>I want to be a city girl walking</i>
<i>the business district with coffee in hand.</i>

36
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,540
What?

37
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,751
Do classes start today?

38
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,502
I didn't buy lunch!

39
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,879
Seriously?

40
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,089
Hey, Komi.

41
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,634
Get me a Sabowey turkey avocado sandwich.

42
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,802
Honey oat, cheese,
lettuce, pickles, extra olives,

43
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,681
no onions, balsamic sauce,
a side of basil fries and a diet cola.

44
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,892
Toasted bread, okay?

45
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,727
Go get it yourself.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,188
Ha-ha, don't be mean, Tadano.

47
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,398
-<i>S-S…</i>
-I haven't finished my homework.

48
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,609
<i>S-Sabowey?</i>

49
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,238
<i>That's another trendy city shop</i>
<i>like Standbakes!</i>

50
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,407
<i>Wow, I want to eat a Sabowey sandwich.</i>

51
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,618
"Compliance-wise that's no good."

52
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>I want to try saying that!</i>

53
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,747
You're my friend, aren't you?

54
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,833
Help your best buddy
in their hour of need!

55
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,001
NOD

56
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,544
-Yay!
-You're really going?

57
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,800
<i>Komi's going to Sabowey!</i>

58
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>This is a great chance!</i>

59
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,928
<i>I'll watch her,</i>

60
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,723
<i>and then I'll become a city girl</i>
<i>who can eat at Sabowey too!</i>

61
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,147
Hmm.

62
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,736
<i>Someone's following Komi.</i>

63
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,323
Komi, in front of such a trendy shop…

64
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,325
And she's standing so poised.

65
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,287
I would get flustered and just go in.

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,540
-<i>She's so calm. I love it.</i>
-TOO NERVOUS TO ENTER.

67
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,501
<i>I feel like that girl's</i>
<i>seriously mistaken.</i>

68
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,461
KOMI DECIDES TO GO IN.

69
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,796
<i>I-I'll go too!</i>

70
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:04,387
FREAKED OUT BY A SHOP
FULL OF COMPETENT-LOOKING PEOPLE

71
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,347
Welcome!

72
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,183
I can take your order here.

73
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,395
<i>It's bad to make the staff wait.</i>

74
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,774
KOMI GOES OUT.

75
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,652
<i>Leaving in a situation like that?!</i>

76
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,238
-<i>What's she thinking?</i>
-GOT SCARED AND LEFT.

77
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,704
<i>She's so amazing!</i>

78
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,291
<i>Doesn't mind the staff.</i>
<i>Keeps her own pace! Her own style!</i>

79
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,753
<i>She just sticks to it! That's so cool!</i>

80
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,422
<i>Wow. I learned so much.</i>

81
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,506
KOMI GOES BACK IN.

82
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,466

83
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,717

Take-out?

88
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,644
What sort of bread?

89
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,271
Which toppings?

90
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,397
Shall I toast it?

91
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,524
Do you want all the vegetables?

92
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,276
Which sauce?

93
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,361
How about making it a lunch set?

94
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,364
-PANIC

I-If you don't have any requests,

97

I'll make our staff recommendation.

98
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,759
FROZEN FROM TOO MUCH INFORMATION

99
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,011
RECOMMENDATION

<i>And someday I'll be a city girl like her!</i>

109
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,620
<i>Alright! Now I'll try and do it like Komi.</i>

110
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,080
<i>I'll buy a sandwich!</i>

111
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:54,997
Uh, hang on…

112
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,292
<i>She bought one just fine.</i>

113
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,587
Uh, Komi…

114
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,090
This isn't…

00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,059
NERVOUS. UNEASY.

Well met, Princess Komilia.

00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,084
Th-This is my abode.

136

INTERESTED

137
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,979
<i>Komi's here, in my room…</i>

138
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,942
<i>Wait. This is a big deal.</i>

139
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,403
<i>The god of our class is in my room.</i>

140
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,989
<i>I've won at life, haven't I?</i>

141
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,160
<i>I've gotta snap out of this</i>
<i>and show Komi a good time.</i>

142
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,289
K-Komi. Um…

143
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,125
Sit wherever you so desire.

144
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,002
FIRST GUEST SINCE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

145
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,683
-Tranquility!
-THE STATE OF BEING TRANQUIL OR CALM.

146
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,142
Ah yes!

147
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,853
I'm just getting to
the best part of this game.

148
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,939
I'd be honored to show you.

149
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,192
SOME COOL IMAGE

150
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,779
<i>Look at these graphics!</i>

151
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,323
<i>These new games are so advanced.</i>

152
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,617
<i>It's even more beautiful than reality!</i>

153
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,035
<i>Isn't it gorgeous?</i>

154
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,704
<i>And the story.</i>

155
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,622
<i>The worldbuilding is so complex.</i>

156
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,125
<i>The character always remains the focus!</i>

157
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,503
<i>Yes! And this last scene,</i>
<i>how can you not cry?</i>

158
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,839
DOESN'T REALLY GET IT

159
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,466
<i>Oh, hold on!</i>

160
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,052
<i>Komi's a non-gamer, an ordinary person!</i>

161
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,180
She won't understand
the fine points of the technology!

162
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,517
-ONLY THINKING "NEAT."
-At this rate, Komi will say…

163
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,352
You bore me.

164
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,645
<i>…and leave!</i>

165
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,607
<i>I'll never get her to come over again!</i>

166
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,483
<i>W-What can I…</i>

167
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,776
Oh.

168
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,529
L-Let's invite Najimi over.

169
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,198
The more the merrier, right?

170
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,742
NAKANAKA BROKE CHARACTER

171
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,661
You call and I appear! Da-da-dan!

172
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,163
Da-dan-daaan!

173
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,372
Terrible rhythm.

174
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,042
It's been ages since I came over.

175
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,376
Hey Komi!

176
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,587
Oh, I brought Tadano too.

177
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,131
Oh, uh, boys are not…

178
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,383
Ah, I understand.

179
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,760
It's fine.

180
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,428
You'll hardly know he's here.

181
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,346
Huh?

182
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,806
What do you wanna do?

183
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,934
-TADANO WAS PERMITTED TO STAY.
-Let's do a four-player game.

184
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,811
Let's play Swamp Bros!

185
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,521
Why do you get to decide?

186
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,814
<i>Swamp Bros.</i>

187
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,901
<i>It's an abbreviation of</i>
Combat: Swamp Brothers<i>.</i>

188
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,781
<i>People love the variety of characters and</i>
<i>dumping their opponents in a swamp to win.</i>

189
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,492
This was huge when we were little.

190
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,785
Everyone's played it, right?

191
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,702
<i>Najio!</i>

192
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,579
-Who are you talking to?
-<i>Chuni!</i>

193
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,289
I've tried it a couple times.

194
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,707
<i>Tadashi!</i>

195
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,127
FIRST-TIMER

196
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,004
<i>Ah, as I thought.</i>

197
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>Komyusho!</i>

198
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,300
Uh, guard with this…

199
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,052
And I think this one…

200
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,262
Whoopee!

201
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,640
The combat has begun!

202
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,808
Komi!

203
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,602
You're a sitting duck! Yoooo!

204
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,273
-Oh!
-I won't let you touch my ally.

205
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,984
Nicely done.

206
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,320
This button is how you move.

207
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,408
Come at me!

208
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,867
Yes! Like that!

209
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,371
And here's how you jump…

210
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,497
Komi!

211
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,083
Keep hitting the jump button.

212
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,459
The jump button!

213
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,713
I invited her to my castle.

214
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,383
I've got to make sure Komi
has a good time!

215
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,093
I won't let her get smashed!

216
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,553
Not so fast!

217
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,888
You haven't changed one bit!

218
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,599
-Combo and attack!
-No!

219
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,813
Heh. I'm still a rank above you.

220
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,731
Now for the finishing bl…

221
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,649
Ah.

222
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,777
I'll admit you once were better than me.

223
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,737
But.

224
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,782
I've got someone to protect now.

225
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,702
"Lose" isn't in my dictionary!

226
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:30,624
This game doesn't reward people
for simply wanting to win!

227
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,338
Oh, if you fall in the swamp,
the mud slows you down.

228
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,506
Press the R2--

229
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,674
The R2 button--

230
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,217
I'M SORRY…

231
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,345
Oh, that's part of the game.
Don't worry about it.

232
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,847
Right here.

233
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,558
Yes! You've got it!

234
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,145
What?!

235
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,938
<i>The Mud Cancel?!</i>

236
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,065
<i>Who pulled off this advanced technique?</i>

237
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,026
Where are you looking?

238
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,235
No!

239
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,705
W-Wow! I beat Najimi!

240
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,831
I lost!

241
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,375
Did you see that? My first victory!

242
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,172
No! That was a fluke!

243
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,089
Huh?

244
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,592
I was just caught off guard
by Komi's mud attack!

245
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,677
Don't be a sore loser!

246
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,596
Next time I'll bring my A game!

247
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,514
Fine.

248
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,849
I'm finished getting warmed-up anyway.

249
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,395
MISSION 31
"IT'S JUST A PART-TIME JOB."

250
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,313
BEEP

251
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,987
H…!

252
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,408
Sorry to call you on your day off.

253
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,745
The other person suddenly had to cancel.

254
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,874
I asked around, but nobody had time.

255
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,292
Let's get started!

256
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,002
A job handing out tissues!

257
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,254
COULDN'T REFUSE

258
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,298
I have to hand out 5,000 today.

259
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,345
It's just handing out tissues.
Komi, you'll be fine.

260
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,014
I'll be working over there. Thanks, guys!

261
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,350
Here!

262
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,227
Please take one!

263
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,189
Here you go! Hey! Tissues!
Anyone need tissues?

264
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,651
FIRED UP

265
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,070
Hey, that girl's so pretty!

266
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,781
For sure. What's she doing?

267
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,576
-Handing out tissues?
-Let's go get some!

268
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,036
But she's not handing them out.

269
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,830
Then what's she doing?

270
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,915
Maybe we shouldn't get involved.

271
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
RE-FIRED UP!

272
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,311
ABOUT TO CRY

273
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,275
FIRED UP!

274
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,118
128 MENTAL DAMAGE (22 LEFT)

275
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,248
Huh? Was she handing out tissues?

276
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,083
I should have taken some.

277
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,504
<i>Oh no! Right now…</i>

278
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,965
-<i>I really want some tissues!</i>
-WOMAN WHO REALLY WANTS TISSUES.

279
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>I feel like I might sneeze.</i>

280
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,219
<i>I spilled my cola. My hands are sticky.</i>

281
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,639
<i>I'm going to see someone, but I'm sweaty.</i>

282
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,849
<i>I've got gum stuck to my shoe.</i>

283
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,143
<i>And I forgot my handkerchief!</i>

284
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,605
-WOMAN WHO REALLY WANTS TISSUES.
-<i>So I really need some tissues!</i>

285
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,067
<i>Oh! Over there, could she be…</i>

286
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,985
<i>Handing out tissues?</i>

287
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,490
<i>But it'd be weird if I asked for some.</i>

288
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,497
<i>The beautiful tissue girl</i>
<i>is looking my way.</i>

289
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,708
<i>Will you give me some tissues?</i>

290
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,045
<i>Tissues… I want some tissues…</i>

291
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,923
-KOMI VISION.
-<i>Tissues…</i>

292
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,262
Thank you!

293
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,598
SHE CLEARLY WANTED TISSUES
SO KOMI MANAGED TO OBLIGE.

294
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,519
Oh, you really are handing out tissues!

295
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,312
Can I have some?

296
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,901
I'll take a pack!

297
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,404
Me too!

298
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,911
<i>Alright!</i>

299
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,706
-<i>Line up for tissues!</i>
-YAMAI APPEARED OUT NOWHERE.

300
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,376
<i>The maximum is five packets per person!</i>

301
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,627
EMPTY

302
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,337
We did it!

303
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,340
That's amazing Komi! Thank you!

304
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,761
I'll give you a third of the money!

305
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,097
Alright, see ya!

306
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,479
A THIRD?

307
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,278
<i>So… hot…</i>

308
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,699
Good morning!

309
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,660
MISSION 32
"IT'S JUST… SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE."

310
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,122
Good morning, Komi.

311
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,041
You're early today.

312
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,801
Huh? What's wrong?

313
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,807
Komi?

314
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,396
CAN'T DECIDE IF SHE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING.

315
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,858
KOMI DECIDES TO JUST OBSERVE FOR NOW.

316
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,279
CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS.

317
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,491
OKAY!!

318
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,203
POINT

319
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,746
What is it?

320
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,293
-ARE YOU TADANO? (HE'S USUALLY PERCEPTIVE)
-What's that mean?

321
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,295
WHY NOT TELL HIM WITH A NOTE?

322
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,630
BUT HE MIGHT FEEL HURT…

323
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,299
JUST DON'T MENTION IT?

324
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,842
HE'LL BE MORE HURT IF PEOPLE SEE.

325
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,260
Komi?

326
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,471
GETS CONFUSED AND STARTS CRYING

327
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,515
Hey Komi! Tadano!

328
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,432
I'M SAV…

329
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,267
Hello!

330
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,145
What's up today, Komi?

331
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,606
What are you doing, Komi?

332
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,733
Good morning!

333
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,819
N-N-Nice weather today!

334
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,779
Good morning Komi!

335
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,030
Loving you as usual!

336
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,741
Komi got here before me again!

337
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,203
Your forbidden power is blazing as usual.

338
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,959
GASP

339
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,880
<i>It was a dream.</i>

340
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,465
THE NEXT DAY

341
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,342
Good morning!

342
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,303
Good morning, Komi.

343
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,763
You're early today.

344
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,022
Najimi, you skipped out on
the meeting again yesterday.

345
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,150
What gives, Tadano?

346
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,652
You want to hang out with me that badly?

347
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,156
Najimi, about the papers
for the culture festival…

348
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,117
Najimi, that book I lent you…

349
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,327
Najimi, you…

350
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,871
Najimi!

351
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,622
Naji…

352
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,707
Huh?

353
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,668
What's wrong, Komi?

354
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,467
SQUIRM

355
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,595
CALL ME BY MY NAME TOO.

356
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,680
Huh? Your name?

357
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,433
What do you…

358
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,272
"You and Najimi are friends,

359
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,274
so you say, 'Najimi' right?"

360
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,609
Oh, yes.

361
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,988
…SO,

362
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,114
Yes.

363
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,576
CALL ME "SHOKO" TOO.

364
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,623
CALL ME "SHOKO" TOO.

365
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,749
BOOM

366
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,877
No, no it's just like, you know!

367
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,087
Calling a girl by her name…

368
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,464
Hey Tadano!

369
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,675
Are you trying to say I'm not a girl?

370
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,676
You can zip it.

371
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,887
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, IT'S OKAY.

372
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,097
I-It's not that I…

373
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,227
I just… how can I put it?

374
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,604
Shoko.

375
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,522
-SHOKO…
-JOLT

376
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,276
FEELS WEIRD, BUT NOT IN A BAD WAY.

377
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,445
Now you try it, Tadano!

378
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,322
Shoko! It's Shoko!

379
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,615
Stop.

380
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,287
Do I really have to say it?

381
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,413
I'M NOT TRYING TO FORCE YOU.

382
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,290
Of course you have to!

383
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,626
It's a request from Komi herself!

384
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,889
Sho…

385
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,559
Sho…

386
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,811
HE COULDN'T SAY IT.

387
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,062
Komi.

388
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,064
-<i>He couldn't say it.</i>
-You got no balls!

389
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,232
CALL ME "SHOKO" TOO.

390
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,025
Okay, next!

391
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,944
Komi, now you try.

392
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,364
Hey. You're going to put
Komi through this too?

393
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,907
Of course!

394
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,326
She's the one who brought it up.

395
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,203
She should start it, right?

396
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,496
<i>Flawless logic!</i>

397
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,290
Alright, try saying it!

398
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,042
By the way, Tadano's name is Hitohito.

399
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,461
Just in case you forgot.

400
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,006
<i>I should hope she remembers…</i>

401
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,760
No writing it down either.

402
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,761
HITOHITO

403
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,020
Hi…

404
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,696
<i>Komi couldn't say it either.</i>

405
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,990
CAN WE JUST GO BACK TO HOW IT WAS?

406
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,617
You guys are hopeless.

407
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,912
Well, Hitohito is tough.
Doesn't roll off the tongue.

408
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,541
Oh, Tadano. You've had a sesame seed
on your face all day.

409
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,378
You have a sesame seed on your face.

410
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,922
<i>Najimi could say it all.</i>

411
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,929
