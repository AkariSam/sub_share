00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,461
Okay!

00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,631
Now we'll advertise the maid cafe
the legal way!

63
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,757
This worries me.

64
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,426
It'll be fine!

65
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,844
Komi, you're tired, right?

66
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,513
Let's go see the other events!

67
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,391

-She's not coming.
-Huh? Not coming?

137
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,479

Don't push Komi too hard.

158

Making embarrassing memories
is what culture festivals are all about!

159
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,207
You're evil.

160
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,629

It's amazing how you can be
so perceptive and yet so dense.

182
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:02,833
Huh?

<i>Why is my heart beating like this?</i>

210

218
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,473
Or it would have been.

219
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,643
But due to a student's
inappropriate profiteering,

220
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,439
the grand prize has been withdrawn.

221
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,280
Yeah, but.

222
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,366
We all prepared together,

223
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,076
eating rice balls,

224
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,538

Don't gloss over it!

227
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,503
Too bad we couldn't get the grand prize.

228
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,175

That reaction's totally different
from what I got!

232
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,184
In the end, they're smiling together.

233

245
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,694
<i>Huh? What? Should I ask her to dance?</i>

246
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,737
<i>But…</i>

247
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,157
<i>I'm sure she's not interested</i>

-Komi?
-Dancing?

252
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,565
-NEITHER CAN DANCE
