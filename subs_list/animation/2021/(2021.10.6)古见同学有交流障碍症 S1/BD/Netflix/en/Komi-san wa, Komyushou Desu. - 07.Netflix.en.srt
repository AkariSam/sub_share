POOL DAY

00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,632
ALL READY

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,221
CHECKS HER BAG AGAIN

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,225
ALMOST TIME TO GO. GETTING NERVOUS.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,399
CHECKS HER BAG FOR THE SEVENTH TIME

7
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,608
Shoko!

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,279
Isn't it nearly time to go?

9
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,572
CLOCK

10
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,410
Have you got everything?

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,413
Towel? Wallet?

12
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,541
Bathing suit? Goggles? Tissues?

13
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,836
-NO TIME FOR THAT!
-Handkerchief? Bug spray? Coin purse?

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,005
YOMIKIRI LAND STATION

15
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,465
30 MINUTES EARLY

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:53,553
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety…</i>

17
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,554
10 MINUTES LATER

18
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,015
<i>…they struggle</i>
<i>to communicate with others.</i>

19
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,058
GETTING NERVOUS

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,976
<i>Bear in mind…</i>

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,686
Hey!

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,647
Sorry you had to wait
and long time no see!

23
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,358
You're so early, Komi!

24
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,862
Oh, that's the dress Tadano picked.

25
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,864
Love it. It looks great!

26
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,657
Let's get going!

27
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,791
Um, uh…

28
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,336
You look very nice.

29
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,548
<i>Bear in mind…</i>

30
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,426
What are you doing?

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,678
I'll leave you behind!

32
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,971
Okay, okay.

33
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,557
<i>…they only struggle to form connections.</i>

34
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,478
<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>

35
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:58,827
MAIN TITLE

36
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,906
This is going to be great!

37
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,783
I wonder if there'll be
any nip-slip action.

38
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,327
What are you saying?

39
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,163
W-Wait up!

40
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,917
Don't leave me behind!

41
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,086
Oh, I forgot I invited Agari.

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,922
You're terrible.

43
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,173
Wait!

44
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,219
Don't leave us behind!

45
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,056
I didn't invite Yamai and the gang.

46
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,601
Oh my, if it isn't Komi!
What a coincidence.

47
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,312
We've all come to the pool too.

48
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,480
D-Deja vu…

49
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,065
Hey, I know!

50
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,692
Since we're all here,
let's go together!

51
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,319
We can hang out!

52
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,321
Yeah! Let's do that!

53
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,657
Fine with me but how about you Komi?

54
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,661
N… NOD…

55
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,248
MORE PEOPLE MEANS MORE STRESS.

56
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,542
Summer!

57
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,710
Sun!

58
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,170
Pool!

59
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,382
Woo! Yay!

60
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,595
Let's do this!

61
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,514
Hey you guys.

62
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,267
Don't get too rowdy in front of Komi.

63
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,686
Got it.

64
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,187
Let's go!

65
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,649
See ya, Tadano.

66
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,650
Bye.

67
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,195
Hang on, where are you going?

68
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,947
-Huh?
-Don't give me that.

69
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,492
GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM

70
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,628
<i>The moment I've been waiting for!</i>

71
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,506
<i>Eight days after
the summer holidays have started…</i>

72
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,844
<i>It was worth staking out Komi's house</i>
<i>every day!</i>

73
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,556
<i>Komi getting changed! Komi's skin!</i>

74
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,308
<i>Komi's bathing suit!</i>

75
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,519
<i>What does Komi have in store for…</i>

76
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,188
SCHOOL BATHING SUIT

77
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,983
SCHOOL BATHING SUIT

78
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,695
<i>H-Her school bathing suit?</i>

79
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,239
<i>Komi, don't you have</i>
<i>any other bathing suit?</i>

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,035
<i>Even so, Komi in a school suit…</i>

81
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,371
<i>I want to see it! I want to see, but…</i>

82
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,792
Komi, let's go buy a bathing suit.

83
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,172
<i>Yamai doesn't want the gang</i>
<i>to see Komi's dorky side.</i>

84
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,975
Thanks for waiting!

85
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,104
It's so hot out.

86
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,065
CHANGED IN THE UNIVERSAL RESTROOM

87
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,027

<i>Ten points.</i>

90
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,991
S-Sorry for the wait!

91
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:11,537
It took me a while to get into my suit.

92
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,708
-<i>Ten points.</i>
-<i>Ten points.</i>

93
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,626
<i>Ten points.</i>

94
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,253
It's so crowded.

95
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,507
Did you get a spot for us?

96
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,054
<i>Ten points.</i>

97
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,200
Wow!

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,294
<i>100 million points?</i>

101
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,547
First off…

102
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,715
The waterslides!

103
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,758
Yay!

104
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,219
Oh, they're two-seaters.

105
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,221
Hey Agari, let's go together!

106
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,349
Y-You really want to go with me?

107
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,186
Yeah. You'll be a good cushion
if anything goes wrong.

108
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,856
Komi, come with me!

109
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,191
-No, me!
-Let's go together!

110
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,318
Rock, paper, scissors!

111
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,070
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

112
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,447
Excuse me.

113
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,908
You'll do. Just hurry up.

114
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,205
Uh, alright. Pardon me.

115
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,290
RUMBLE

116
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,892
<i>I don't hate this.</i>

117
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,728
<i>Tadano discovered a new thrill.</i>

118
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,238
A-Are you alright?

119
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,449
WANTS TO GO AGAIN.

120
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,075
Shall we go again?

121
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,080
KOMI WENT FOUR MORE TIMES.

122
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,708
Let's go to the lazy river!

123
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:26,172
Hooray!

124
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,342
Woof! Woof, woof, woof!

125
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,720
YAMAI AND THE GANG

126
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>Something's in the water.</i>

127
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,726
Let's see who can
hold their breath longest!

128
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,438
The first one up buys the winner a soda.

129
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,191
-Ready? Go!
-Hang on!

130
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,759
KOMI GOT NINE CANS OF SODA.

131
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,971
Hey, Komi, um…

132
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,530
Oh, it's nothing.

133
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,324
Whew.

134
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,535
This sure is fun.

135
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,249
Wow!

136
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,459
Alright! To the diving board next!

137
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,794
Running is dangerou…

138
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,212
Komi!

139
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,423
TRIP

140
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,383
Komi! Augh!

141
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,093
Komi!

142
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,641
FIRST AID STATION

143
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,608
Komi, are you alright?

144
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,359
NOD…

145
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,946
<i>Wow, talk about bad vibes.</i>

146
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,408
You can't go in the pool now
with that scrape.

147
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,244
We've had enough fun. Let's go home.

148
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,662
Y-Yes!

149
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,913
I agree.

150
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,123
SHAKE SHAKE

151
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,920
-FRET
-NOTHING TO WRITE WITH!

152
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,255
I'll bring it.

153
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,716
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. GO HAVE FUN.

154
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,760
B-But…

155
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,677
Alright!

156
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,680
Okay, let's all go
to the lazy river again!

157
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,724
Hey, hang on.

158
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,268
-Let's go, everyone!
-Hey, wait.

159
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,478
You too, Yamai!

160
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,521
Um, no, I'm…

161
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,025
Komi, you stay with our bags and rest!

162
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,526
NOD

163
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,369
Najimi, hang on. I…

164
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,039
Times like this, it's best to
have fun and not fuss.

165
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,919
Otherwise she'll think it's her fault
for ruining our good time.

166
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,420
Komi will feel bad, right?

167
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,590
You've learned how to read the room.

168
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,426
Huh? You mean I haven't
always been reading it?

169
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,845
That's not the issue.

170
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm going to file down that bad poolside.

171
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,184
I wanted to say that's why I'm not going.

172
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,110
Where to next?

173
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,667
Does it still hurt?

174
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,421
Oh, sorry I startled you.

175
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,256
DIDN'T YOU GO TO THE LAZY RIVER?

176
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,384
Oh, I'm tired so I decided
to take a break.

177
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,149
It's alright.

178
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,861
Najimi and Agari are having fun.

179
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,740
Yamai and the gang are filing down
the spot where you tripped.

180
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,953
Yeah, I don't really get it either,

181
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,665
but your friends
are all good people, Komi.

182
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,711
You don't have to worry
that they'll hate you.

183
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,352
I HAD FUN.

184
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,486
IT WAS SO FUN BEING IN THE POOL
WITH EVERYONE.

185
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,365
BUT I RUINED EVERYONE'S GOOD TIME…

186
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,868
I HATE THIS FEELING.

187
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,758
Komi!

188
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,269
If you look sad,
nobody will be able to have a good time.

189
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,276
Can you stand?

190
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,170
-Komi's hand! Oh, never mind!
-NOTICED HE WAS HOLDING HER HAND.

191
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,558
Komi-- blublublub…

192
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,642
Hey, hey!

193
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,353
Enough with the teenage drama!

194
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,190
We bought these so you can play too, Komi.

195
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,902
H-Here! Use this water gun!

196
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,864
We'll join you!

197
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,699
Hey!

198
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,034
-Eat this!
-Naji-- blublublub…

199
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,927
Whew.

200
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:51,265
I didn't expect you to
go flying into the lifeguard.

201
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,474
Classic Tadano.

202
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,392
Shut up.

203
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,811
Agari, did you have a nip-slip?

204
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,104
Huh? Uh…

205
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,443
The waterslides were so fun.

206
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,111
Yeah, I know, right?

207
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,488
It was a good day, hey Tadano?

208
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,573
Hm?

209
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,408
Yeah.

210
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,535
It was fun.

211
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,543

Hm? What?

214
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,472
Going to the library?

215
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,099
Alone?

216
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,313
SCARED

217
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,023
My, isn't that unusual.

218
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,900
Alright, take care.

220
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,909
Will you be okay?

221
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,830
Honey.

222
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,542
Shoko's going to the library.

223
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,715
HE'LL WALK HER THERE.

224
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,552
I never know how you two communicate.

225
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,776

What a beautiful girl!

229
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,888
Why don't they talk?

230
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,056
Are they fighting?

231
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,392
Having a serious discussion?

232
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,395
What can I get you?

233
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,604
