1
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,588
Combat Agent Six.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:05,623
Yes.

3
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:12,276
The Kisaragi Corporation will dispatch you to spy as an advance unit.

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,096
Got it!

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,434
We've found in this universe,

6
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:21,231
there are many planets with similar environment to Earth's.

7
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:25,609
So we plan to dispatch you to one of them.

8
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,027
Got it!

9
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:32,908
Go ahead, Combat Agent Six!

10
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,786
Show our power to the whole universe.

11
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:38,579
Sorry, I don't understand what you're talking about.

12
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:40,707
Which part don't you understand?

13
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,167
All of it!

14
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,795
First, if we have a method to go to other planets,

15
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:48,548
I'd have been a child of a planet that has only women with big boobs.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,036
Hey,

17
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:53,262
I can take your weird costumes

18
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:55,472
and weird-sounding self-descriptions just as jokes,

19
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,350
but as for the universe,

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,185
even I think it's a bit of a stretch.

21
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:01,603
Don't take my uniforms as cosplay costumes.

22
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,231
You even said there was something wrong with our descriptions.

23
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,759
How dare you be so disrespectful

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,444
to Flaming Belial and Freezing Astaroth,

25
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,563
two of the three executives of the Kisaragi Corporation?

26
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:12,572
What are you so angry about, Miss Yukari?

27
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:15,450
Can you speak that again in front of your parents?

28
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,162
Don't call her real name and mention her parents!

29
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:21,165
Listen up, Combat Agent Six.

30
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:25,295
Now our corporation will achieve the goal of conquering the world.

31
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:26,587
Do you know that?

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,171
Yes, I do.

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,176
And what do you think will happen to you

34
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,721
after we conquer the world?

35
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,682
We'll become dominators

36
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:40,852
and live the rest of our life as we please.

37
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:41,643
You're so stupid.

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,896
You'll face mass layoffs.

39
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,522
Does that mean we'll be fired?

40
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,480
That's right.

41
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,194
Are you kidding me?

42
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,733
You devastated my body with the transformation. You're responsible.

43
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,158
-Specifically…
-It's going to fall off.

44
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,409
-You'd better let me move in.
-Enough.

45
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,328
I'll explain in order.

46
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:07,209
It's true that what human can do most now is go to the moon.

47
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,882
But Black Lilith, one of the three executives of the Kisaragi Corporation,

48
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:12,966
is the world's most brilliant scientist.

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,640
Look at this!

50
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,097
This is one of the greatest masterpieces I've ever created.

51
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,849
It can perhaps address the problem of all mankind.

52
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,935
What's this, Miss Lilith?

53
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:25,687
It looks like a teleportation machine that appears in movies.

54
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:27,939
You're right, Six.

55
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:30,108
Though you're stupid, you have a good intuition.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,364
There is another greatest masterpiece of mine…

57
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:36,098
Alice, come here.

58
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,084
What's wrong with this kid?

59
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,211
I'm not a kid, bastard!

60
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,796
What an arrogant small potato!

61
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,800
Do you want a fight?

62
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,510
I'm a fighter of an evil organization.

63
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,552
I won't show mercy even on kids!

64
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:01,306
If you hit me,

65
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,618
I'll lose control of my built-in power furnace

66
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,395
and destroy this area.

67
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,145
If you don't mind, go ahead.

68
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,429
By the way, my official name is not Kid,

69
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,110
but a bionic female robot made by the Kisaragi Corporation.

70
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,611
Is that real?

71
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,989
Of course.

72
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,282
This child is called Alice.

73
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,867
She is a high-performance bionic robot made to support you.

74
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,288
I heard you're an idiot.

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,082
So when we get there, I'll do the mental work.

76
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:27,959
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,377
I don't need this mean and dangerous metal crap.

78
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,758
By the way, when you need weapons and other supplies,

79
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,260
send a note back with this small conveyor.

80
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:40,344
You have to apply every time.

81
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,348
There are two orders for you.

82
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:46,269
The first is to build a base

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,854
and set up the transporter

84
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,937
to ensure transpotation between there. and the Earth

85
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,608
The second is to conduct a survey over there.

86
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:57,405
It includes the local strength, resources, soil and other aspects.

87
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:02,324
If it goes well, I hope you can also sort out food and environment issues.

88
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,289
Is this a mission of great importance to the fate of Earth?

89
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:11,596
That's why you can only succeed.

90
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,056
Surprisingly, you entrust such an important mission to me…

91
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:16,906
Well, how should I say it?

92
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:22,762
We've known each other since the early stage of the Kisaragi Corporation.

93
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:30,437
I also consider you one of our highest-ranking officials.

94
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,442
Although a lot of things have happened,

95
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:40,237
I'm happy to work with you in this group.

96
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,266
I don't know what will happen this time.

97
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:47,620
But I'll do my best to come back.

98
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:53,668
At this time, you should promise you'll get back safely, you idiot.

99
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,880
You also have to report back on your progress every week

100
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:02,427
to let us know you're doing well there.

101
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,596
Miss Astaroth…

102
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,182
Can I hug you before leaving?

103
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:09,935
Why don't you just kiss her?

104
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:10,560
Wait a minute…

105
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,521
May I?

106
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:12,766
I think it's OK.

107
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:13,437
Wait a minute…

108
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:16,608
Of course not.

109
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,658
Good! Anyway, we won't make any progress if we keep delaying.

110
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,576
I'd better teleport you immediately.

111
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,411
Fine.

112
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,870
I'll go.

113
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:30,540
That's it in a nutshell, right?

114
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,041
I'm the best person to represent the Kisaragi Corporation.

115
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,416
Is that so?

116
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,151
Astaroth rolled the dice…

117
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,809
OK, Lilith, start it!

118
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:38,879
OK.

119
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,550
Prepare to teleport.

120
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,423
Start!

121
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:46,721
I'm feeling a little nervous.

122
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,307
What are you afraid of, small potato?

123
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:52,226
Even if we fail, it'll be fine as long as there is a backup.

124
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,187
You're an idiot.

125
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,523
I, an honorable human, are not like you who can save and load.

126
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,858
Stop it!

127
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,403
But I won't be too worried about it.

128
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:05,490
How could the genius scientist, Miss Lilith, fail?

129
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,660
Miss Lilith,

130
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:10,036
what's its success rate?

131
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,163
How many times have you experimented with it?

132
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,040
Its success rate is currently 100%.

133
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,709
But I won't tell you the number of trials.

134
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,547
Did you only try it for a few times?

135
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:22,091
Listen to me, Six.

136
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,718
What if an accident happens after several experiments?

137
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,915
Yes, if so, the success rate won't be 100%.

138
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,624
Sorry, I think I'd better give up on this mission.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,019
I believe you'll come back safely.

140
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,158
Then go ahead!

141
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:36,062
Wait a minute!

142
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:38,440
I don't think you're a genius scientist.

143
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,524
-It's just scrap.
-Can't wait to hearfrom you.

144
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:41,526
Rest assured,

145
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,569
Combat Agent Six.

146
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:52,245
Damn, you'll be doomed when I come back.

147
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:55,206
Damn, you little girl!

148
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,228
(Episode 1: Combatants Will Be Dispatched!!

149
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,076
Idiot!

150
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:11,641
That woman is really an idiot!

151
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,557
She's an idiot!

152
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:16,478
We're about 30,000 meters away from the surface.

153
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,189
Alice, you're a high-performance robot, right?

154
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,483
You can turn on flight mode,

155
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:22,923
right?

156
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:26,112
I only have a self-destruct function.

157
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,865
You're a piece of junk.

158
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,992
Self-explosion is the romance of bad guys.

159
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,494
Here. It's a parachute.

160
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:35,497
Don't fail to land.

161
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:37,916
If I fall to the ground,

162
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,168
the whole area will be flattened.

163
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,797
I think bringing you with me is a punishment game for me.

164
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,252
Look over there.

165
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,783
It looks like a town.

166
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,141
I don't want to build any safe base.

167
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,310
Get the transporter set up immediately.

168
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,728
Let's go back.

169
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,663
Then I'll pinch hard that girl's nipples to take revenge for almost dying.

170
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,942
I can't assemble it in such a place.

171
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,151
That's a high precision machine.

172
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,250
And it'll take almost a month to stabilize the teleportation channel.

173
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,326
It's impossible to go back right now.

174
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,831
Are you kidding me?

175
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,415
They framed me again.

176
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:19,541
It hurts!

177
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:20,584
What are you doing?

178
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,752
To prevent you from catching any unknown diseases,

179
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:25,422
I injected an immune-boosting nano machine into you.

180
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,675
I don't know what happened to you.

181
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,718
But we found a place that looks like a city.

182
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,802
That's a very lucky start.

183
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,971
Let's go there first.

184
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,515
You… Wait…

185
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,311
We chose a planet similar to Earth this time.

186
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,732
So there's probably a civilization built by Homo sapiens just like you.

187
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,652
It's a pain in the ass to walk.

188
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,850
Let's ask her to send a mobile SUV.

189
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,990
Didn't she say we could use this if we need anything?

190
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,243
Six, how many villainy points do you have?

191
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,123
About 300.

192
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:00,456
300?

193
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:04,586
That's not enough for us to invade a fortress city.

194
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,544
Overruled.

195
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,298
No, wait a minute.

196
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,773
Did you mean it costs villainy points to request supplies?

197
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:13,710
I accumulated them through many petty crimes.

198
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,722
How stupid are you?

199
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,683
Villainy points aren't traded for pleasing rewards.

200
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:23,813
All Kisaragi members undergo physical transformation to have a chip implanted in their brians

201
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,153
to confirm the crimes that the members do.

202
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,652
and give points accordingly.

203
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,528
Villainy points increased.

204
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,780
Don't underestimate me.

205
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:33,157
I also know that thing.

206
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:36,326
Then what did you do with villainy points?

207
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,205
They're supposed to be exchanged for high-quality equipment

208
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:41,581
to strengthen yourself.

209
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,543
Anyway, you probably said it was a necessity.

210
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,544
You traded them for erotic books, right?

211
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:49,090
That's why you remain a junior all this time.

212
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:51,383
Why are you talking as if you know my daily life?

213
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,427
You should give me the latest equipment without saying a word, right?

214
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,804
In that case, no matter what kind of opponent we face,

215
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,304
I…

216
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:01,905
You liar!

217
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,482
Didn't you say this planet is similar to Earth?

218
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,941
There's no such thing on Earth, you idiot!

219
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:16,739
There's a lot of them. Don't miss.

220
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:19,052
How can a robot take an honorable human as a shield?

221
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,912
I'm a high-performance bionic robot.

222
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,240
To ensure reality,

223
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,791
I was designed with the strength of an ordinary girl.

224
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,212
You're a useless piece of junk!

225
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,595
I'm going to be eaten!

226
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:39,013
It's impossible that it's on par with me!

227
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:44,311
It's as strong as a combatant with a modified body and a battle suit.

228
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,397
Can't underestimate the creatures on this planet.

229
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:48,480
Don't stay there and analyze so calmly.

230
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,668
Figure out something to do!

231
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,668
How can a piece of junk like me do that?

232
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,946
I'm sorry for my uselessness, Mr. Six.

233
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:56,157
Please help me!

234
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:59,658
I take back what I said just now.

235
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:04,414
Trade your villainy points for a shotgun for me as a gift.

236
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,748
Then I'll find a way to help you out.

237
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,875
I'll give it to you. Hurry up!

238
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,293
(SHOTGUN)

239
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:24,365
(What are you doing here?)

240
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:29,488
(Answer me! What are you doing in my country?)

241
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:34,235
-Alice, what should we do now?
-(Say something!)

242
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,654
-Wait, let's hear for a little while longer.
-(Say something!)

243
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,947
But I can't understand their language…

244
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,783
What language do you speak?

245
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,909
You also wear armour I've never seen before.

246
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,788
And you don't seem to have anything weapons on you.

247
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,423
-Who the hell are you?
-Alice.

248
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,043
I feel some magical power awakening in my body.

249
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,294
For some reason, I can understand what she is saying.

250
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,255
I'm strong enough, and I can still have new power.

251
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,590
How strong will I become?

252
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,967
What are you talking about?

253
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:59,870
The chip implanted in your head

254
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,907
delivers my translation to your brain to make you understand it.

255
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,392
The chip can also do this?

256
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,769
I've never heard of it. It's terrifying.

257
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,248
Compared to that, I'll handle this thing first.

258
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,774
I'll explain it, Lord Knight.

259
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,734
Please don't be angry.

260
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:19,538
This man is a man of some standing in a country.

261
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,533
He led his troops and fought for his people.

262
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,409
But…

263
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:28,890
He was badly wounded when he rescued me from the ferocious mob.

264
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,375
He is insane now.

265
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,543
What?

266
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,172
Why did you suddenly make me such an exaggerated character?

267
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:36,256
Listen up, Six!

268
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,676
You're so stupid. You'll give yourself away sooner or later.

269
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:43,149
But this way, you can ask common-sense questions and not seem weird.

270
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:46,008
(For Snow Japanese sounds like this.)
What the hell are you talking about?

271
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,475
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:51,019
By talking to him in his native tongue, I can calm him down.

273
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:53,065
You don't even have any luggage.

274
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,524
How did you even get here?

275
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,860
To heal this man's brain,

276
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,028
we set out on a journey to find ourselves.

277
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,533
But we were attacked by animals in the forest, and lost all our luggage.

278
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,654
I thought you were thieves that I could trade for merits.

279
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:08,578
But you're travelers.

280
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,791
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

281
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,291
But that's my job.

282
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:19,508
I still can't believe you came through the Great Forest of Magic.

283
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,259
But seeing this, I have to believe it. You're strong.

284
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:25,971
My name is Snow,

285
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:29,308
captain of the Guard Knights in this country.

286
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,977
If you don't have any money,

287
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,562
I can offer you a job.

288
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,230
Thank you, Lord Snow.

289
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:38,484
You're welcome to my country.

290
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,153
Besides, it's lucky that we meet each other.

291
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,658
I'm the Princess Tirrith's knight,

292
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:53,250
and captain of the Guard Knights, Snow.

293
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,458
Open the door!

294
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,380
Thank you.

295
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,136
Snow, what the hell is that?

296
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,388
Looks like a chariot to me.

297
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,490
A chariot? Do you know what this ancient artifact is?

298
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:13,894
It's an ancient weapon

299
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,715
that protected this country from big monsters in ancient times.

300
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:20,652
It seems to be what I need to investigate.

301
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,945
We performed magic to preserve it,

302
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,448
but a lot of it has still decayed..

303
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,532
Magic?

304
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,702
But I don't know how to use it.

305
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,371
Only a limited number of people have magic.

306
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:33,778
Magic…

307
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:36,542
Explosion!

308
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,422
You said he was mentally disturbed.

309
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,548
Is this what you meant?

310
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:45,092
Please try to ignore him if you can.

311
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:49,302
Snow, welcome back.

312
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:51,307
Thank you for completing the mission.

313
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,684
Who are these two?

314
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,604
I'm Combat Agent Six.

315
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:58,023
I'm the beautiful, high-performance bionic robot,

316
00:14:58,024 --> 00:14:59,649
Alice Kisaragi.

317
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,203
Is it fine for you to introduce yourself like that?

318
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:06,672
You also said Combat Agent Six.

319
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,158
Where's your real name?

320
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,951
You two, greetings to Her Highness!

321
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,912
This is the princess of this country,

322
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:15,499
Christoselis Tirrith Grace.

323
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,542
What a long name!

324
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,625
How dare you!

325
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,211
Just call me Tirrith.

326
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,701
-Alice.
-Greet her.

327
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:25,514
-This's a real beauty.
-Shut up.

328
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:27,427
I'll tell you this out of pity.

329
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,346
-The princess is laughing because you're an idiot.
-I'll cut you!

330
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,429
I see.

331
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,517
It seems that you're indeed not from this country.

332
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:39,020
-One who knows me won't react like that.
-You bastard, stop it!

333
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,605
Right, Snow?

334
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,442
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:46,111
They seem to have come through the Great Forest of Magic

336
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,576
and killed many fatal crocodiles.

337
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,160
I think they're quite strong fighters.

338
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,873
Yes, I've led many combatants

339
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:59,208
against the entire world and fought countless battles.

340
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,504
Mr. Six, my country is at war with the demons.

341
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,505
We lack commanders and knights now.

342
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:06,883
Demons?

343
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,471
The Demon King in the neighboring country suddenly declared war on us.

344
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,182
It happened so suddenly. What do they want?

345
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,058
I guess they want land.

346
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,039
Their country is suffering from a huge beast called the Sand Lord.

347
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,231
The desertification is getting worse every year.

348
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,860
The demons have many skilled fighters.

349
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,236
We're at a disadvantage now.

350
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:28,236
Mr. Six,

351
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,033
can you help my country?

352
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,620
Damn! Even if you're a foreigner,

353
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,706
you should still be sensible.

354
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,503
How will you compensate me
if you bring down my reputation?

355
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:41,543
Lord Snow!

356
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,711
Don't be angry with him.

357
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,298
Though he behaves so rudely, he's an expert in combat.

358
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,923
He'll perform well in the future.

359
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,886
Then you'll get merits for discovering us.

360
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,517
What? So that's it?

361
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,561
You said you wanted to offer us a job, as if you showed us kindness.

362
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:04,775
But in fact, you want my power and sexy body, right?

363
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:05,942
I don't want your body.

364
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:07,653
To be honest,

365
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:12,030
What I like most are fame, money and famous swords.

366
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,576
Six.

367
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,619
I always feel that I can smell the same things on you.

368
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,080
I have quite a high status.

369
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:23,626
If anyone tries to persecute you two newcomers,

370
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,586
I can deal with them with my authority as captain of the Guard Knights.

371
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,174
What do you think? We're on the same page.

372
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,375
Don't treat me like your type, evil girl!

373
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:37,307
Bastard, do you think you can talk to a captain like this?

374
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,933
Lord Snow, what is this?

375
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:45,314
It's a legendary relic that is said to bring rain.

376
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,526
When the season in need of rain comes every year,

377
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:52,239
the royal family of this country will pray for rain.

378
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,615
But it's broken.

379
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,577
Now we can only buy water from other countries.

380
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,413
I should be able to fix such a thing.

381
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:01,830
Really?

382
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,000
Can I open it and see what's inside?

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,959
No problem.

384
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,621
-I'll take full responsibility even if you cam't fix it .
-Why do you have that thing on you?

385
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,922
How is it? Can you fix it?

386
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,840
Seems like so.

387
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,259
Okay, I'll call someone.

388
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,515
Alice, Six,

389
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,977
the credit will be shared by three of us.

390
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,310
It's a deal.

391
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:28,273
What? She did nothing.

392
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:32,564
If so, you're the same.

393
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,615
OK, it should be good.

394
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,991
Next we just need to reboot it.

395
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,124
Next start the reboot!

396
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,251
Please reset the password.

397
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,501
Password?

398
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,297
Reboot completed!

399
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,548
Please set the password.

400
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,843
Penis Celebration!

401
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,640
Penis Celebration. It has been set.

402
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:03,143
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:04,603
Listen carefully, Alice.

404
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,688
The royal family will pray in front of the crowd.

405
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,047
Pe…

406
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:12,862
Pe…

407
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,195
Peni…

408
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,114
Penis…

409
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:20,493
That way I can see Tirrith's shyness every time

410
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,287
and earn many villainy points.

411
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,748
What the heck!

412
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:27,666
Besides Tirrith, any member of the royal family can also do this job.

413
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:30,419
Penis Celebration.

414
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:33,561
The king must be a very old man.

415
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:37,300
And he has to say this stupid childish password in front of crowd.

416
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,929
What should I do?

417
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,097
I feel I'm in trouble.

418
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:46,477
Mr. Six.

419
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,814
What trouble did you make?

420
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:51,022
Villainy points increased.

421
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,362
Whispering…

422
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,409
-Such an obscene word…
-Alice, look.

423
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,951
That king's beard would scare Santa away immediately.

424
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,371
Will I be scolded if I say I want to touch it?

425
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,624
Shut up! The person in front of you is the King.

426
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,208
Six.

427
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,202
What a stupid thing you did. It's hard to understand.

428
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:16,090
But since you fixed the ancient artifact,

429
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:18,342
I'll let you off the hook.

430
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,594
-Go to another…
-Father.

431
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,346
Please wait a moment.

432
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:26,224
This one is a talent that I want to hire.

433
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,769
But…

434
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,936
Miss Tirrith,

435
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:32,397
it's dangerous to place a man of unknown background with you.

436
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,234
What a pity if we lose their battle strength and knowledge!

437
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,573
Father, what do you think?

438
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:41,490
Well…

439
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,076
Since Tirrith has said so,

440
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,703
I agree.

441
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:50,665
Six, it seems that the princess is the true ruler of this country.

442
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,670
I can sense the King is a useless father.

443
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:56,298
-Shut up.
-I see. We should compliment Tirrith.

444
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,175
I'll handle it.

445
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:58,048
Shut up!

446
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:58,923
Then…

447
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,886
I have my father's permission.

448
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,971
Look forward to working with you, Mr. Six.

449
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,517
Now that you've said so, I can't refuse.

450
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,396
I didn't decide to help because you're a beautiful girl.

451
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,272
Don't play that disgusting farce.

452
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:18,444
Your Highness, please think this over.

453
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,071
He did that thing to the important ancient artifact.

454
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,865
This man may be a spy from another country.

455
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:27,244
Then you're a traitor for introducing spies.

456
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,623
Did you call me a traitor?

457
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:34,137
Everyone knows I'm the most loyal to Miss Tirrith. How dare you say that?

458
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,423
I'll feed you to my favorite sword, Scorching Fire Strike!

459
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:43,039
I've been hired by Her Highness!

460
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,806
Is it okay for you to cut me without her permission?

461
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:50,643
Besides, there are other things you must face, right?

462
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,978
Things that I must face?

463
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:56,273
I'm willing to take all the responsibility.

464
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:57,566
You said that, didn't you?

465
00:21:57,893 --> 00:21:59,653
That means…

466
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:14,625
From today on,

467
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:19,255
Combat Agent Six will be promoted
to knight of honor of the Grace Kingdom.

468
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,173
You will be in charge of a guerrilla force.

469
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,303
What? Am I not the Princess's guard?

470
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:27,555
That's the leaders' decision.

471
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:31,808
And I'll be the vice captain of your force

472
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,229
and take care of you.

473
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,356
But I don't regard you as my supervisor.

474
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,983
And I don't trust you at all.

475
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,902
If you have other intentions,

476
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,694
I suggest you'd better give up now.

477
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:46,324
Someone is taking it out on us for being demoted as punishment.

478
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,535
How can you be so shameless?

479
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:49,410
What a shame!

480
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,161
I wasn't demoted.

481
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,248
I'm here to keep an eye on you suspicious people.

482
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,634
I think only she thinks

483
00:22:57,635 --> 00:22:59,296
she's here to oversee.

484
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:00,503
Of course.

485
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,340
That ancient artifact is a national treasure, but it was made fun of.

486
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,596
She should have committed suicide for that.

487
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,515
She must be hypnotising herself.

488
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:11,516
What a poor girl!

489
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,518
What? Alice…

490
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,563
You shouldn't talk to me like that!

491
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:21,232
You have been impolite to your superior. You can't tell me how to talk.

492
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,885
You useless miser!

493
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,615
You two basters!

494
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,230
(MEETING IN PROGRESS)
Six is so lucky!

495
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,881
(NEXT EPISODE)

496
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:49,596
I should have filled the dice with lead to get my number.

497
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,806
One and two of the dice represent Astaroth.

498
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,140
Three and four represent me.

499
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,976
Five represents Lilith.

500
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,602
Six represents Combat Agent Six.

501
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,650
After all, we have to choose someone from trustworthy members.

502
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:03,395
That's how it was decided.

503
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:06,278
Someone threw a tantrum when we decided to dispatch him.

504
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,960
(Next Episode: Rough Up the Competitors in the Same Industry)
It's a very important task.

505
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:10,199
(Next Episode: Rough Up the Competitors in the Same Industry)
Of course, she'll be worried about Six

506
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,144
(Stay tuned)
who is the weakest.

507
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:15,497
But when he succeeds in this mission,

508
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:17,665
he'll be promoted to the highest-ranking official.

509
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,667
Then we'll probably become the Four Heavenly Kings.

510
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,253
Yeah, I hope Six can work hard…

511
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,756
So…

512
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,549
Hurry up and report to me.
