1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,160
This is…

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,960
Alright, Six.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,600
What's are we going to do next?

4
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,760
Our original plan was to wait it out.

5
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,969
But we didn't expect the ruins to be vulnerable to his attacks.

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,469
Yeah, you're right.

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,429
It seems that we can't hide here.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,140
Do you want to let me try and use my curse?

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,159
If that thing is a magical creature, my curse may work.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,770
Try and use it on Alice first.

11
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:39,850
So, it's this kind of game.

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,030
Let's test it out.

13
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,439
It's impossible to hypnotize an android.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,039
Perfect, let me show you that my powers are real.

15
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:55,880
Hey Grimm, just in case it fails, use a simple curse…

16
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:59,770
O' Great Zenarith, let misfortune befalls this midget.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,340
Let her be crushed by falling debris!

18
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,849
Why do you always die before combat?

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,689
Captain, it seems that the walls are falling apart!

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,730
The debris is increasing!

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,400
I will not give up until the end!

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,159
As long as I don't give up, there will be a way out of this.

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,909
Listen! We must survive regardless of what's going to happen!

24
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,150
Why don't we offer this woman whose only worthy attribute is her looks

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,500
and beg him for forgiveness?

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,579
Captain…

27
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,709
Can you let me negotiate with him?

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,709
Maybe, I am the same type as that guy…

29
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:46,049
And if you think about it, maybe I can learn about my origins.

30
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,049
That's it!

31
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,129
Alright, we don't have a choice anyway.

32
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,430
Listen up, Rose.

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,230
In order to improve your sense of companionship…

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,120
If I throw everything at a trainee,

35
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,909
Astaroth will kill me if she finds out.

36
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,500
Stay here and protect Grimm.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,669
Let's think of another way to deal with that guy.

38
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,050
Is it really okay?

39
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,430
Trainee combatant, don't look down on the Kisaragi Corporation!

40
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,639
Our technology is very advanced!

41
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,310
If we make our move,

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,270
that chunk of scrap metal is nothing.

43
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,400
Hold on a moment,

44
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,229
when did I become a trainee combatant?

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,569
Didn't I reject the offer earlier?

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,280
So that's what it is, Alice.

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,569
Do you have any plans to turn this around?

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,069
There's something we can do.

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,830
However, there'll be three main risks.

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,120
First, we will have to give up on retrieving that robot.

51
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,129
Next, are you prepared to let your villainy points go into the red?

52
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:05,129
Wasn't that point loan system disabled?

53
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,180
I'd applied so that you cannot borrow any points outside of emergencies.

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,469
Otherwise, you will go on an endless spending spree.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,430
I'm glad that you understand me.

56
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,770
But, it was an emergency when we were stuck in the desert, right?

57
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:24,039
Aren't you being too stringent on me?

58
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,110
If things had gotten worse, I would apply for it.

59
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,569
Didn't you survive until the end?

60
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,370
I was confident with your abilities to survive.

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,699
That's not fair.

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,629
I understand, now please tell me about the last risk.

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,419
The last risk is time.

64
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,129
You have to face the robot alone.

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,680
If you want to buy time, then you can leave it to me.

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,259
After all, I'm the resilient Combat Agent Six.

67
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:58,270
I don't know what you are going to exchange with the points,

68
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,810
but you can leave the rest to me.

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,400
My clever partner.

70
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,530
Though your thoughts and personality are worrisome,

71
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,199
I believe in your combat capabilities.

72
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,689
My strong partner.

73
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,189
Episode 12 Strong Partner and Clever Partner

74
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,629
Alice, where are you going?

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,050
Aren't we going to support Captain?

76
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,420
All of you, come and help me.

77
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,759
Let's go to the room that housed the large robot. It'll be spacious there.

78
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,350
We also need to operate the assembly machine.

79
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,220
But one person's ability is very limited.

80
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,560
So remember, Six's chance of survival is dependent on our speed.

81
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,519
Assembly?

82
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,279
This is troublesome.

83
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,699
All of you, go in and drag them out.

84
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,779
If you do so, I won't blame you for letting them in.

85
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,319
Understood, Sir Russell.

86
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,910
We will go and catch the intruders immediately.

87
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,509
You're too noisy, you little brat!

88
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,800
If you want to bang the wall, go to a love motel.

89
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,250
Well…

90
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,949
Do you think a mere human like you can defeat me alone?

91
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,069
I don't know what's the energy source you're using,

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,860
but by powering that huge thing, it shouldn't last long, right?

93
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,120
I see.

94
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,639
You want to delay as long as possible to exhaust its energy source

95
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,199
How unfortunate.

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,459
This thing is fueled by the pilot's life energy.

97
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,540
So, if it is driven by a chimera like me,

98
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,060
it can run for long period of time.

99
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,589
Too bad for you.

100
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,379
So what?

101
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,759
I'm used to prolonged battle.

102
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,339
Let's see how many hours I can evade your attacks.

103
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,220
Darn it.

104
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,850
Then, forget about it.

105
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,980
Stay there and watch, coward.

106
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm going kill your comrades first.

107
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,899
Are you afraid?

108
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,529
You must be afraid, right?

109
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,990
Seems like I should crush you first.

110
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,629
Darn it!

111
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,420
He was doing all these pointless things since just now.

112
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,839
What is this?

113
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,889
Hey, just now you said I was "a mere human", right?

114
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,519
I'm not a human since a long time ago.

115
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,490
Darn it.

116
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,079
All these small moves

117
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,750
You should understand that it's impossible for me to run out of energy.

118
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:11,750
That's right.

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,920
It makes sense now.

120
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,339
You were trying to buy time since just now.

121
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,470
Is he really trying to deplete my energy?

122
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,810
You don't look like the type who will sacrifice himself for his comrades.

123
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,240
Where are you looking at?

124
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,730
If you let your guard down, I'm going to cut you into pieces.

125
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,279
What is that midget trying to do?

126
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,089
I should leave the disposable underlings to the last and deal with…

127
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,529
Who's the disposable underling?

128
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:44,120
Remember my name!

129
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm an employee of the Kisaragi Corporation, Combat Agent Six!

130
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,560
Although I am grunt without any special titles,

131
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,050
you should not look down on an experienced veteran.

132
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,180
You got to be kidding me, right?

133
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,389
That's how it is.

134
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,600
You said it's an ancient weapon, but in the end, it's just a paper tiger.

135
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,149
You're Russell of the Water, right?

136
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,149
You said you're one of the Four Heavenly Kings, but you're just a brat.

137
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,899
Too slow!

138
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,049
I've finally caught you.

139
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:47,179
This is bad.

140
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,720
You're very cocky a while ago.

141
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,059
Don't even think that you will get an easy death.

142
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,240
You're such an idiot.

143
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,700
When you say something like that, it is bound to fail.

144
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,419
What's that sound?

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,799
She requested something amazing again.

146
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,639
There's no mistaking it.

147
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,850
When our comrades hear it, they'll rejoice!

148
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,059
When our enemies hear it, they'll be frightened of the sound of its engine!

149
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,570
The pride of Kisaragi Corporation: the giant multi-legged combat vehicle.

150
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:43,279
Wha…

151
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,379
Also known as…

152
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,159
Destroyer!

153
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,039
I've kept you waiting, partner.

154
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,539
Leave the rest to me.

155
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,840
What is that?

156
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:16,309
Alice!

157
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:20,519
Go get him!

158
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,470
How dare you!

159
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,600
Are you awake?

160
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,070
I've injected you with nanomachine to treat you.

161
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,940
Do you feel hurt anywhere?

162
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,519
No, I don't feel any pain.

163
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:09,860
That's good.

164
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,620
You might have hit your head, so I will help you do a checkup later.

165
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:17,120
If you become more dense than you are now,

166
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:19,169
I will be troubled no matter how strong I am.

167
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,340
Isn't that too harsh for someone who has just recuperated?

168
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,299
So, what happened after that?

169
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,370
We won, of course.

170
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,259
I had beaten that robot into a junk metal.

171
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,309
You did well, Alice.

172
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,059
Our Destroyer is amazing.

173
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,019
The opponent's specification is better,

174
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,350
but the skill of the pilot was what matters in the end.

175
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,070
We were slightly damaged, but it's not a problem.

176
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,740
You said damaged…

177
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,269
Are you alright?

178
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,070
Yeah.

179
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:55,620
It's a Destroyer we've obtained by putting your points in the negatives.

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
The repair will take some time,

181
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,039
but I will make sure it is functional again.

182
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,129
What I'm asking is…

183
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,139
Whatever, never mind.

184
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,730
On the other hand, Russell was captured by Snow and Rose.

185
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,230
The Toris army ran away when I used the Destroyer to scare them.

186
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,529
That's good.

187
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,029
Actually, I've already figured out how to use that little brat.

188
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,779
What about the Demon King's Army?

189
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,830
Tiger man had chased them away.

190
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,000
He had also claimed some of their lands along the way.

191
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,370
With this, we've completed Astaroth's mission.

192
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,960
What's left is the peace negotiation with Toris.

193
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,049
We'll leave that to the princess.

194
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,259
I see.

195
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,889
I have a final question.

196
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,679
Why did you remove my underpants?

197
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,269
I wasn't removing them, I'm helping you wear them.

198
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,019
It's the same!

199
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,149
Why are you helping me wear my pants when I'm sleeping?

200
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,940
Is it that?

201
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,899
Are you interested in my 'that'?

202
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,860
I'm not interested in your OOX.

203
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,870
I'm only helping to clean up your feces and urine.

204
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,330
Don't call it OOX.

205
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,909
At the very least, use something more powerful…

206
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,409
Wait, feces and urine?

207
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,070
How long was I out for?

208
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,750
Around three days.

209
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,840
If you sleep for that long, your excrement will come out naturally.

210
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,429
I won't be able to marry anymore.

211
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,429
Don't be disheartened, pants shitter.

212
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,850
I don't want to have this nickname.

213
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,139
If you grow old and cannot move anymore,

214
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,940
I will help look after you until you die.

215
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:45,350
Partner.

216
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,190
That's right.

217
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,399
Astaroth's attitude is too rigid,

218
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,120
Grimm is a ticking time bomb, Rose is very scary,

219
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,909
Don't even mention Rose.

220
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,120
Seems that I'll have to settle for you.

221
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,090
That's very bold of you to say that, bastard.

222
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,710
You're lucky that I'm an android.

223
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,090
If I'm a normal girl, I will cut you into pieces.

224
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,049
That's right, you're an android!

225
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,629
You should ask someone to give you a taller body with bigger breasts.

226
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,889
And add some other functions too.

227
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,730
I cleaned up your mess all this time, and you dare to make fun of me?

228
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,190
If you're looking for a fight, I'm ready to beat you up.

229
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,899
Wait, Alice.

230
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,159
We haven't cleaned up all the 'mess'.

231
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,409
Come with me for a moment.

232
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,580
You seem to be doing well.

233
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:50,710
You're alive even after I beat you up.

234
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,090
That's impressive.

235
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,169
That's because being tough is what I'm good at.

236
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,590
Let's talk about something else, I've brought…

237
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,590
I refuse.

238
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,600
I haven't even finish talking yet.

239
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,970
Stop being a brat and listen to me.

240
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:05,389
This is good for you too.

241
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,899
Do you know that this country is facing a water crisis?

242
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,190
-If you use your powers…
-You're too noisy.

243
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,779
I've already said, I won't listen to any of your request!

244
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,860
Even though I'm just a child, I am also an executive of the Demon Army.

245
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,659
I won't be swayed easily by your words.

246
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:28,250
I am advising you to join us when I'm still nice.

247
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:29,879
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

248
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,830
Try me!

249
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:35,509
Combat chimeras are resilient to heat, cold or pain.

250
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,929
So I can handle any form of torture.

251
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,759
Or maybe you're reluctant to interrogate a child as an evil organization?

252
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,809
Alright, I give up.

253
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,309
Tiger man, I'm sorry, I couldn't do it.

254
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,730
Is that so?

255
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,149
Let me handle it from here.

256
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,059
What's this?

257
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,820
I didn't know Tiger man is good at interrogation.

258
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,870
What's with this fellow?

259
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,409
You're humans but have a beast man in your ranks?

260
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,379
Hey, beast man. Do you understand what am I saying?

261
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:16,340
Say something to me.

262
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,210
Good job, Six.

263
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,759
Next time, I will treat you to some good alcohol.

264
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,929
Tiger man is so impressive.

265
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,850
Not only are you disgusting, you're generous too. That's so cool.

266
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,440
If only you agree to Six's proposal just now,

267
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,690
you will only need to make some water every day.

268
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,279
My name is Tiger man.

269
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,059
I love children.

270
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:47,789
I've decided to undergo surgery and become a bishoujo after retirement.

271
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,830
Licks.

272
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:49,789
Huh?

273
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,669
Do not doubt it.

274
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,200
We will become good friends after this.

275
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,669
Don't worry, I will be gentle.

276
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,679
What a pity.

277
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm sorry, but I'm a boy.

278
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,809
Can't you even tell the difference as a beast man?

279
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,809
I know you're a boy.

280
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,220
Or should I say, I prefer otokonoko.

281
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,730
Russell looks very cute. You will look good in a skirt.

282
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,150
What kind of stupid things are you talking about?

283
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,230
You're bluffing, right? You're trying to scare me, right?

284
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,069
I have a very big heart.

285
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,829
I won't care if you're a girl or a boy.

286
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,920
Tiger man is amazing!

287
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,336
Though I don't understand what you're talking about,

288
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,880
you're so disgusting that it's cool.

289
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,630
Alright! I understand!

290
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,049
I admit defeat!

291
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,089
I'll make water or do anything!

292
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,130
Tiger man is awesome!

293
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,049
The little brat is willing to cooperate now.

294
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,680
Stop saying such stupid stuff.

295
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,180
We've already reached this point, but you won't let me relieve myself.

296
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,890
How can that be acceptable?

297
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,849
I surrender!

298
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,059
This is too much!

299
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,059
It's too much!

300
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,519
I'm sorry!

301
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,230
Please let me go!

302
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,400
It can't be helped then.

303
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,869
I will let you go for today, but you have to wear this maid costume.

304
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:15,079
However, you've to work hard and create water for the Kisaragi Corporation.

305
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,500
You did something stupid there.

306
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,670
Although we're different, but as a member of an evil organization…

307
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,469
If you want to fight, you should fight to the end.

308
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,089
If you want to betray, you should betray from the beginning.

309
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,390
I can't accept this.

310
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,099
After I cursed Alice, I lost my memories.

311
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,480
When I woke up at the altar,

312
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,150
-Everything has ended!
-What type of meat is this?

313
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,589
-Where can I ever debut?
-This is an eel, a high-end fish.

314
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
-You'll have your chances.
-This is an eel, a high-end fish.

315
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,490
-Isn't your job to provide entertainment for everyone?
-High-end fish?

316
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,450
Hold it, don't say it as if I am a clown.

317
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,829
Ever since I joined this team

318
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,119
-I always get myself into unfortunate incidents.
-Alice, what is this pyramid scheme business?

319
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,700
-I was abandoned in Toris.
-Can you explain it to me?

320
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,039
-I was baked to a crisp in the desert.
-Don't do this type of business.

321
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:57,789
-I was also abandoned at a fellowship gathering in town.
-Don't do this type of business.

322
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,000
-These have nothing to do with me, okay?
-What about these high income hotel ladies?

323
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,500
What are you trying to do? This is annoying.

324
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,799
Alright.

325
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,880
I will ask Tirrith to assign you to another team.

326
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,259
No!

327
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,220
I beg you. Captain, don't abandon me!

328
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:13,599
Aren't we comrades who had shared our joys and tears?

329
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,979
You've always treated me nicely in the past,

330
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,640
but you're going to abandon me after you get tired of me.

331
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,559
This is too much!

332
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,859
Isn't it because you keep whining all the time?

333
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,569
What do you want me to do?

334
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,670
What I mean is that you can treat me more gently.

335
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,440
-It feels prickly.
-Since our relationship is good that we can go and date at night.

336
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,109
-It feels prickly.
-You even saw my panties.

337
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,700
-Is this really a fish?
-If you dare to abandon me, I will curse you!

338
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,160
-It's called an electric eel, a high-end fish.
-You're so annoying!

339
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,670
-It's called an electric eel. It's a high-end fish.
-I don't expect anything from you!

340
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,250
But you must at least wear some shoes!

341
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,890
And you should walk by yourself!

342
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,039
Didn't I say it before?

343
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:41,750
I'm unable to wear shoes because I'm cursed!

344
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,839
What is it? It's scary when you suddenly stop talking.

345
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,430
That's right.

346
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,140
It's my fault for believing that you will explode if you wear shoes.

347
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,140
Captain?

348
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,470
That's right.

349
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,519
If you can walk on your own feet,

350
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:01,099
You'll be able to contribute in the desert or the ruins.

351
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,480
Captain, what are you trying to do?

352
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,609
This is not a laughing matter.

353
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,609
Alice, please request some socks from Kisaragi Corporation.

354
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,490
I'm going to let this woman wear them.

355
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,819
This is interesting.

356
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,539
No!

357
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,619
Captain, I beg you! Please forgive me!

358
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,210
I will do anything, just not this!

359
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,539
Grimm, you said anything right?

360
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,920
Then…

361
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,170
Let's go!

362
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,420
How dare you, you midget.

363
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,220
Wait, it's not like this, Zenarith-sama.

364
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,809
This is irresistible.

365
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,519
Grimm, you're getting very hot.

366
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,980
And you look as if you're giving out light.

367
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,059
Self-destruct?

368
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,190
Are you going to self-destruct?

369
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:47,940
Idiot, why do you look so happy?

370
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,240
Everyone, evacuate!

371
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,700
Evade!

372
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,819
Evade!

373
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,490
Grimm!

374
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,039
Get some water, quick! Put the fire out!

375
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,329
That's amazing, I'm impressed.

376
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,420
Self-destruct is a romance for bad guys.

377
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,880
This is brilliant.

378
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,130
Idiot, it's not the right time to talk about these things.

379
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,220
Bring the materials for the resurrection.

380
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,470
Really.

381
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,509
It's hard to progress with the peace negotiation with Toris.

382
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,099
Father. Brother.

383
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:22,980
Please watch over me from heaven.

384
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,779
Russell.

385
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,700
Gadalkand.

386
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,329
Faustress.

387
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:45,420
I will avenge you.

388
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,420
As stated above,

389
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,420
though we've completed our mission, we can't afford to be careless now.

390
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,599
Therefore, I request for reinforcements.

391
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,309
Faustress of the Wind.

392
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,440
Even if this world is different, I will not let you have your way easily.

393
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,650
Hero, make your move.

394
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,049
The Demon Army reigns supreme.

395
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,960
Combatant Eighteen and Nineteen!

396
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,950
You should have a limit to when you want to play hero.

397
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,480
I should just send myself over as reinforcement?

398
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,759
It's finally completed.

399
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,799
Since I've completed our mission,

400
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:36,970
I should be able to live peacefully now.

401
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,849
Good job… I really want to say that.

402
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,470
But you still need to earn back your points.

403
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,269
Yeah, you're right.

404
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,769
It's not the time to return to Earth.

405
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,730
Oh? Are you homesick?

406
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,690
One of the stars here is the sun.

407
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,109
If you look carefully, you might be able to see Earth.

408
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,609
If that's true…

409
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,740
There'll be a planet to invade for every star out there.

410
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:05,700
When can I start living luxuriously without a care?

411
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,430
Let's see.

412
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,213
If you can dominate all the stars over here,

413
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,089
you will be able to live luxuriously.

414
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,450
How long will it take to do all of these?

415
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,049
If I'm not able to go back, I should become the ruler of this planet.

416
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,970
Then, I will create my own harem!
