1
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:21,230
Combatants Will Be Dispatched!

2
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:35,265
Episode 6 Combatants Will Be Dispatched!

3
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:49,040
We're not going to make it.

4
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:52,572
Grimm, can you deal with the Golems with your curses?

5
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:53,864
Just leave them to me.

6
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:57,242
Master Zenarith is about to get active.

7
00:01:57,243 --> 00:02:00,245
And under the guise of defending the towns,

8
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:07,251
I collected all couple rings as oblations to Master Zenarith.

9
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,424
Great. Everyone, form a formation with Grimm at the center.

10
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,384
Fall back! The gate is fallen!

11
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,100
Give us Six.

12
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:24,520
I'll definitely not let that man live.

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,479
Your opponent is me.

14
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,775
Grimm, stall those Golems!

15
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:33,277
Great Master Zenarith, please bring disasters to these Golems.

16
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,616
Seal its feet on the ground!

17
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:45,498
Now move!

18
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,835
You won't get me again!

19
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,843
Great Master Zenarith, please bring disasters to this woman.

20
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,305
Seal her magic of fire forever!

21
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,688
It didn't work?

22
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:13,443
If I could gather enough courage,

23
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,540
I would curse your breasts to fall down

24
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,322
without the fear for a backfire

25
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:22,972
But even if I am backfired and not able to use the fire magic,

26
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:24,258
I have no loss.

27
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,376
I will curse you to the end until I use up all the oblations.

28
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:29,960
You slut!

29
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:33,003
What are you playing, Heine?

30
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,675
I seemed to see your faces somewhere.

31
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,973
What's wrong with you Chimera?

32
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:46,768
Rose.

33
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:52,022
Get lost!

34
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:04,911
Since you're a half-Demon, you can tell from your instinct

35
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,038
that you cannot defeat me.

36
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:11,169
I know I cannot win.

37
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,210
But...

38
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,673
You are that eager to die?

39
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,675
Why do you fight against us?

40
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:21,177
You must have been treated badly by human, haven't you?

41
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:25,391
I'm a combatant intern.

42
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,351
I'll fight however frightened I am.

43
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:32,230
And my grandpa said in his last words,

44
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:35,026
if I had companions,

45
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,194
I should never leave them behind.

46
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,278
Then you can die now!

47
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,699
Miss Snow?

48
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,658
Rose, I will handle it from now on

49
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,538
I should be determined now.

50
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,500
I should at least give him one strike.

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,791
I think you'd better not do it.

52
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,127
Though I don't know what's in your mind,

53
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,369
This is what I, presbyter of immortality,

54
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,423
would like to advise you.

55
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,386
death is really painful.

56
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,386
Grimm...

57
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,555
Miss Snow, please hurry up.

58
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,309
We need to help Princess Tirrith go to a safer place.

59
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,687
With the Captain protecting her alone, you cannot possibly feel relieved.

60
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:13,896
Snow, go to watch him.

61
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,608
You...

62
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,194
Are you asking me to escape?

63
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,865
Great Master Zenarith,

64
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,617
immerse them in my raging fire.

65
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,812
Rest in peace forever.

66
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,327
Crimson Breath!

67
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,504
No, I don't want to!

68
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,048
Hurry up, go to a shelter!

69
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,007
I won't leave here!

70
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,427
Please run away and tell the story of this country.

71
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,012
Tell it yourself!

72
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:48,391
Even though the country is fallen,

73
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,307
your survival itself means victory.

74
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,603
If you want to maintain the royal blood, I would assist you at all costs.

75
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:57,733
Let's go, Alice.

76
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,567
Got that!

77
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,194
Don't say such nonsense, put me down!

78
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,737
Anyone! Help!

79
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:06,699
Six, the situation is bad. Be quick!

80
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,495
Combat Agent Six.

81
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,041
Now here are six Golems.

82
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,295
Heine of the Flame and Gadalkand of the Earth are on their way.

83
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,757
Make way! The situation is bad enough.

84
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,591
If you want to escape, now it's the time.

85
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,096
If we run with the townspeople, the chance of getting killed is lower.

86
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:30,223
How could you say it without any guilt?

87
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,475
I don't even want to be angry.

88
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,689
Now Rose and Grimm are stalling Heine's army.

89
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:42,485
I don't think they can hold on any longer.

90
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,572
For the things in the past, I can make up to you all you want.

91
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,824
So...

92
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,826
Please, help us.

93
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,610
Anything I can do, I'll do it.

94
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,497
You can take the money, and the sword.

95
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,418
I am not supposed to say this,

96
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,172
but my fortune is of a considerable amount.

97
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,637
Six, don't listen to her.

98
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,968
The rest of the villainy points should be used for escape.

99
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,095
We don't have spare strength to help them,

100
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:16,560
Who cares about you? We are just some nobodies.

101
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,814
And you are the reason for all these!

102
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:23,067
You are such a...

103
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,904
Because I'm a member of the Evil Organization.

104
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,079
I feel so unreconciled.

105
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:37,540
I have always worked so hard.

106
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,293
But they didn't even consider me as an opponent.

107
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,800
I hate to be subject to them all the time.

108
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,598
Please, Captain.

109
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,725
Captain.

110
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,853
Please save Rose and Grimm.

111
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:08,321
You're such a dabbler of evil deeds, never make it to the end.

112
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,386
That's why you remain a crew despite that you joined the Organization

113
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:14,762
earlier than anyone else except the supreme leaders.

114
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,288
Enough of nonsense.

115
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,999
Tell them to send some heavy sniper rifles.

116
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,625
Alright.

117
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:24,586
Captain, what on earth are you doing here?

118
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,841
Now there's no time to go to the gate.

119
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:29,843
Surely we will attack directly from here.

120
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,678
I won't run away anymore. Can you leave now?

121
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,265
Mr. Six, you are so cool right now.

122
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,101
What's wrong? The points are not enough.

123
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,770
I did leave over 200 points.

124
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,110
Well, as you know, the entertainment here is highly limited.

125
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,947
So last night...

126
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,697
you know...

127
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,240
You read those?

128
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,244
You trade the important points for dirty books?

129
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,245
At this crucial moment, the night before a war,

130
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,788
you read things like that?

131
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,041
What happened?

132
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:04,626
This guy is a clown after all.

133
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,172
There is no other way. We're in emergency.

134
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,631
Six.

135
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,216
Yes.

136
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:10,551
Go downstairs.

137
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:14,241
Find that useless, arrogant king and give him a punch.

138
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:14,947
I'll be right back.

139
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,389
Stop.

140
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,932
My father is innocent.

141
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,475
Let me go.

142
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,019
It is necessary to do so.

143
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,730
I'm not doing it for fun.

144
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,688
Just punch someone in the face?

145
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,109
Not really.

146
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,110
Just do something that will make others feel offended.

147
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,363
I see.

148
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,575
Punch me.

149
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,663
I don't know how this works exactly. But you must do it, right?

150
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:44,625
Or... If you need to offend me,

151
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,340
you can rub my boobs or whatever.

152
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,623
No... you caught me by surprise...

153
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:55,596
Just do it, Six! We're running out of time.

154
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,058
Boobs or lips, whichever you like.

155
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:59,349
But...

156
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,817
For real?

157
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:11,277
Will you kiss her?

158
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,491
Do it, Six! Just do it!

159
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,327
Kiss and use your tongue!

160
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,578
Do it. Don't chicken out.

161
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,495
Hurry up!

162
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,957
What are all these?

163
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,457
Alice is so noisy.

164
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,710
My heartbeat is also so loud.

165
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:30,379
What am I supposed to do?

166
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,842
And Tirrith, you are a princess. You are such a goat.

167
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:36,427
She is not a middle-school student. And it's just a kiss.

168
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,331
Wait.

169
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,889
Is it consensual?

170
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,767
Though I rub her boobs....

171
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,166
Villainy points added.

172
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,964
Combatants Will Be Dispatched!

173
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,857
Damn it! Get away!

174
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,442
Evil God worshipers!

175
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,336
Give us Six!

176
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:43,376
What? High-level magic?

177
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:55,548
Is that you, Six?

178
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:59,219
I'm all out! All out!

179
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,720
Amazing!

180
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:02,679
Shoot!

181
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:05,182
OK.

182
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:09,812
Every shot feels like a punch to me.

183
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,105
Shut up and go die.

184
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:14,640
You said it yourself that I could do whatever I wanted.

185
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,618
Shut up and go die.

186
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,070
Fire!

187
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,618
Now all Golems are destroyed.

188
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,910
The fight will be easier then.

189
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:26,287
Shut up and go die.

190
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,624
The Four Heavenly Kings must be still alive.

191
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:32,835
Everyone, hurry into the room now!

192
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,097
Here you are, Six.

193
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:45,390
I'll kill you.

194
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:47,655
-The guy who blew us up.
-It seems that they took the bait.

195
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:48,644
-That was you, wasn't it?
-Yes.

196
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,607
And the guy who destroyed my mana-channel crystal

197
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:51,730
right in front of me.

198
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,476
What, this guy?

199
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,590
Did you bury that woman's body properly?

200
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:00,364
Is your brain as small as the birds' because of your wings?

201
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,240
If you meant Grimm, I believe you saw her just now.

202
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,871
A dangerous weapon indeed.

203
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:10,832
But it cannot fire shots continually, can it?

204
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,793
Or we are minced meat now.

205
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:15,837
Listen carefully.

206
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,005
After we get closer, we attack simultaneously.

207
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,048
We must kill that guy!

208
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,431
Six, I'll take care of the others.

209
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:28,642
You find ways to defeat the Four Heavenly Kings.

210
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,601
You've stopped calling me Captain already?

211
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,605
So soon.

212
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:34,397
Alice.

213
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,481
Tell them to send the R Buster Sword.

214
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,110
But your points are already...

215
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,581
Alice, please hurry.

216
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:43,780
I won't be responsible for the consequences.

217
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,158
Just do it.

218
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:49,703
Damn.

219
00:13:58,318 --> 00:13:59,129
Six.

220
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:09,480
Have you ever thought of the situation if I had failed to react in time?

221
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:10,433
No.

222
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,269
You are still angry about the underwear thing.

223
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,604
Weapon's coming!

224
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:16,615
Six, ready to catch it.

225
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,701
What is that?

226
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,870
Where did you get that weapon?

227
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,996
This?

228
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:35,249
It is called the R-type Anti-Panzer Vibrating Cutting Buster Sword.

229
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,351
A cutting machine with a redundant name.

230
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,798
Also a weapon to cut trash like you up.

231
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,676
but it can only stand for one minute.

232
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:52,350
My unique skill that sent a lot of heroes to their deaths.

233
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,644
Lift restrictions!

234
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,729
What on earth are you doing?

235
00:14:57,033 --> 00:15:00,447
The safety device of the combat suit is about to be removed soon.

236
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,192
Are you sure?

237
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,402
I am.

238
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:05,029
Once the safety setting is lifted,

239
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,198
After the one-minute restriction lifting operation,

240
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,283
there will be about three minutes of cooling time…

241
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,287
Are you really sure?

242
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,288
Six, what are you doing?

243
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,749
Snow, step back.

244
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,167
Please lift it.

245
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,794
Start counting down.

246
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,710
10 9...

247
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:23,756
Alice,

248
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,051
Six is going to make a mess, isn't he?

249
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,469
There's no need to stop him?

250
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,052
I'll finish you now.

251
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:33,057
5 4...

252
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,725
Combat Agent Six.

253
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,105
Finish them all!

254
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,528
The safety device has been removed.

255
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,696
I'm a combatant of the Kisaragi Corporation.

256
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,865
Combat Agent Six.

257
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,491
There is no need for another evil organization.

258
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:54,245
You guys can meet your end here!

259
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,914
Come on, human.

260
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:07,841
Run, run.

261
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,614
I'm going to die, too?

262
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,250
Good job.

263
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,793
You... you...

264
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:50,842
I thought I was about to die!

265
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:53,388
I really thought that you would kill me too.

266
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,640
That's why I told you to step back.

267
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:58,267
Please explain it clearly to me next time.

268
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,102
So should we grind her to minced meat too?

269
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:03,273
Heine.

270
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,190
Here.

271
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,736
Let's make a truce.

272
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,028
For about a month.

273
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,326
Is it really OK to make a truce?

274
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,621
Of course, just hold on for a month.

275
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,499
I have my plan.

276
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,211
More importantly, Snow.

277
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,630
You said you would do anything for me, didn't you?

278
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,131
Now go to take a bath.

279
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,548
Wash every corner of your body clean.

280
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,842
You...

281
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,304
Well I have to go downstairs

282
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,767
to express my gratitude to the brave solders.

283
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:43,233
Six, come here after your cool-down is finished.

284
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:44,646
I have things to negotiate with you.

285
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,942
S...Six.

286
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,986
No, Cap... Captain.

287
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:52,863
I know it sounds selfish to say so.

288
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:55,741
Stop it, idiot.

289
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:57,617
Please, just...

290
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,453
Regarding sleeping together,

291
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,707
can you forget it for now?

292
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,916
Stop, you are getting too close. It's scary!

293
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,492
I get it.

294
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:05,711
I get it really! So stop!

295
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,255
It doesn't matter what you said.

296
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,256
You bitch.

297
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:11,133
Master Astaroth, and you too,

298
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:13,259
women are always the same.

299
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,846
You use me when you need me.

300
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:19,317
Idiot, I felt agitated at the first sight of you.

301
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,896
Please just let me be for now.

302
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:32,236
I don't hate your liking me.

303
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,239
But I am not sure of how I feel myself.

304
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:39,367
But I will think about my feelings towards you from now on.

305
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,788
What are you talking about?

306
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,211
I don't remember that I said I liked you.

307
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,505
Your appearance and body shape are attractive to me.

308
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,592
That's why I want a one-night-stand.

309
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,800
Don't make me say it out loud. It's embarrassing.

310
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,266
Calm down. We can talk.

311
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:05,060
You see, I cannot move right now.

312
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,691
If you strike me angrily, I will die for sure.

313
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:11,777
Calm down, Snow.

314
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,362
You're a girl with good tolerance.

315
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:14,820
A girl who is willing to make efforts.

316
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,700
Cool down finished.

317
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:19,450
Yeah.

318
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,494
Lift restrictions!

319
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,257
Thank you very much.

320
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,925
If you really think so,

321
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,760
you can write down my name

322
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,887
in the history of this country

323
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,681
and pass it down one generation after another.

324
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,354
Mr. Six.

325
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,607
Would you like to be a knight of this country again?

326
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,859
No, thank you.

327
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,654
It's exhausting to handle a group of strange subordinates.

328
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,365
How could you say that, Captain?

329
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,575
Strange subordinates, you didn't mean us, did you?

330
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,743
I'll bite you even though you're Captain.

331
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,804
Ouch! Stop it Rose.

332
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:08,375
Captain, you did special things with me. How can you leave me behind?

333
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,876
You should be responsible for my body being like this.

334
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,211
Shut up, Grimm.

335
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,256
I just gave you a new wheelchair and pushed you everywhere.

336
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,134
Are you leaving for your homeland?

337
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,678
Of course.

338
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,635
Staying here,

339
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,912
God knows what will certain angry woman do to me?

340
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:24,974
I see.

341
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,058
Speak it out if you want to.

342
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:32,190
In the battle against the Demon Army, we suffered a great loss.

343
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:37,068
We're looking for commanders of army and talented fighters.

344
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,194
So?

345
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,700
I don't care who you are

346
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,200
and where you are from.

347
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,038
If you hate a subordinate like me...

348
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,329
Or you can be a mercenary?

349
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,933
Do you lack combatants?

350
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,815
Hey, man!

351
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:17,109
You.

352
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,195
You look terrible.

353
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,280
I've heard it all from Snow.

354
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,324
You did many good things.

355
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,285
What's that?

356
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:29,079
This, is a weapon targeted bald guys.

357
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,289
Some call it packaging tape.

358
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,709
I will make your head a wilderness.

359
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,712
Villainy points added.

360
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:43,002
Six, as an idiot, you were quite thoughtful this time.

361
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,387
What? By the way, the word idiot is totally unnecessary.

362
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,807
Check your villainy points.

363
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,061
190 points.

364
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:53,855
That's a lot.

365
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:54,980
Watch carefully.

366
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:58,233
-190 points?

367
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,112
If we go back to Japan with minus points,

368
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,824
we will be arrested by the sanction troops.

369
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,682
What... what should I do?

370
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:06,991
Listen, Six.

371
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,246
Even if we can go back to Japan,

372
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:11,079
you should stay here

373
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,709
to earn enough points, above zero, and then go back.

374
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,710
That's it.

375
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,170
I have to make up a reason of your not returning

376
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,088
in the report.

377
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:22,298
And by the time the points are enough,

378
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,676
I'll stay here with you.

379
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,761
Master Alice.

380
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,013
Fine.

381
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:31,518
Just think hard on how to make points as soon as possible.

382
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,644
No problem!

383
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,061
Leave it to me, partner.

384
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:37,855
First I will strip off all the clothes of my subordinates.

385
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:40,067
You cannot be serious.

386
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,146
-More points more points.
-Why did you call me partner?

387
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:45,489
I am an assisting bio-robot.

388
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,957
Partner, I see.

389
00:22:58,522 --> 00:23:00,881
(REPORT BY ALICE)
Alice made a perfect proposal.

390
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,651
(Preview on the Next Episode)
After conquering the Earth,

391
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:04,842
we can offer jobs to combatants.

392
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,554
(Next Episode Episode 7)
Plan of Dispatching Combatants?

393
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:10,472
(Marriage Hunt Charlatan)
They are short-handed, especially combatants.

394
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,931
(Coming Soon)
So we just need to send combatants there.

395
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,478
So they become the men of justice.

396
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,105
Six is working hard.

397
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,772
He said he wanted to be the head of a branch.

398
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:22,611
After all, the proportion of women is quite high over there due to wars.

399
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:24,987
And they seem to be beautiful girls.

400
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:29,576
In the reports from Six, he mentioned women a lot.

401
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,087
Six will come back willingly, right?

402
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:33,787
I think so.

403
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,957
Will he get married there

404
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,083
and stay permanently?

405
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,846
