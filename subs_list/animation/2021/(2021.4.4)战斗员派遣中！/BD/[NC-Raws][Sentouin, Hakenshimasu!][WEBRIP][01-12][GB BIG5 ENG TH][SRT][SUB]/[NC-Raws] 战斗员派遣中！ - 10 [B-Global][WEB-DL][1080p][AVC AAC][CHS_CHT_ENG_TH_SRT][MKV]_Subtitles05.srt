1
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,883
We're just one step away from world dominance.

2
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:12,846
We have gone through the massive rebellion led by the heroes

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,849
Cheers

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,524
KISARAGI CORPORATION APPRECIATION DINNER

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,701
Isn't this too careless?

6
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,789
After all, everyone has survived the intense battle.

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,875
It's normal for them to want to slack off.

8
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,960
It's a reward only for tonight.

9
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,045
I understand as well,

10
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,048
but we are slacking off at the moment,

11
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,466
while Six is working hard on the other side.

12
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,429
You're so rigid like usual.

13
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,347
Relax for a moment.

14
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,164
Look.

15
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:59,176
If all of us executives work endlessly,

16
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:01,228
how are you going to persuade our subordinates to rest?

17
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,064
Fine,

18
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,981
we rest for tonight.

19
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:07,942
Yes, now you should enjoy as well.

20
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:08,944
Ho…hold it.

21
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,697
Let's get rid of these clothes and swim!

22
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,489
First of all, let's race for 1,000 meters.

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,909
We are all women, so there's no need to feel embarrassed.

24
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,037
Unless you want to swim naked?

25
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,581
Wait… Don't say such stupid things.

26
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,334
Villainy points added.

27
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,890
Episode 10 Kisaragi Leaders Will Be Livestreamed!

28
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,812
I'm back.

29
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,150
I've placed that weird mummy girl on the altar,

30
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:13,151
she will probably revive on the next day.

31
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,069
Good job.

32
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:19,658
Once Grimm revives, we will head toward the Toris Ruins

33
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,003
Before we do that, remember to make preparations.

34
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:26,540
Yes, before that, I should make some complaints to Astaroth.

35
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,667
Did you do something wrong again?

36
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,086
It's not us but them, Tiger Man.

37
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,299
It's their fault for prohibiting us from loaning villainy points.

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,664
I almost died in the desert.

39
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:40,394
Six, about this…

40
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:41,680
You have mail!

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,270
It's from Lilith.

42
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,567
To all Kisaragi Corporation employees,

43
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:56,527
Don't miss the arrival of this special livestream.

44
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:58,241
That's all.

45
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:02,032
Lilith is doing something silly again, right?

46
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,789
It's Belial.

47
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,793
-You can identify her just like that?
-It's my victory.

48
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,609
It's a close win.

49
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,177
It's nice to have a swim sometimes.

50
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:22,678
-It's true, right? Let's compete once more.
-Six

51
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:25,389
-No, let's compete 10 more times.
-We can't turn the camera angle.

52
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:30,021
Hey, we're going to fight the executives of the Demon Army tomorrow,

53
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,355
and you're having a night pool party now? Are you looking down on me?

54
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,608
HOT! IDEAL BOSS POLL

55
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,735
Everyone seems to be exhilarated down there.

56
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:38,778
It must be the company's routine poll.

57
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,100
Aren't they bored with it yet?

58
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,300
Yeah…

59
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,286
I've no idea who started this silly project.

60
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,706
I remembered that it was Six who started it.

61
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,581
Lilith?

62
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,334
Here, this is for you.

63
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,629
Thank you.

64
00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:00,009
In the past, Six caught the heart of a mantis woman and an arachnid woman.

65
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,596
Both of them forced Six to decide on them.

66
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:09,475
That guy is really popular among weird women.

67
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,478
That's right.

68
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,357
Then Six said,

69
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:18,692
"You're both so charming that I can't make up my mind."

70
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,240
That's right, he is always hesitant.

71
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,115
Tha…That's right.

72
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,706
Then, he suddenly put forward with a popularity contest,

73
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,497
and involved everyone in it.

74
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,250
Well, it ended up being a tie,

75
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,838
and the mantis woman and arachnid woman got along with each other

76
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,339
Now, they are a very powerful pair.

77
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,303
That guy looked as if he don't care

78
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:47,680
but in reality, he was surprisingly aware of his surroundings.

79
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,973
Is that right?

80
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,642
Did that guy really think that much?

81
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,774
Damn. They are having fun all by themselves on Earth.

82
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,944
What's with the temperature difference between here and Earth?

83
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,987
So, that's what she's trying to do.

84
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,324
I understand what Lilith is planning to do.

85
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,661
She gather all the audiences and then…

86
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:13,747
You must subscribe to the channel before you can continue watching.

87
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,836
it will become this.

88
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,961
No way, Lilith…

89
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,007
Damn, I can only subscribe now.

90
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,012
And there are a bunch of these silly men.

91
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,262
Lilith is very smart.

92
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:29,639
Subscribe.

93
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,017
What's this?

94
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,269
Is she really thinking about giving fanservice?

95
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,023
If that's true, I will be very upset.

96
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:42,485
I would rather watch a zashiki-warashi kaijin give fanservice.

97
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,197
Do you want to bet who's going to be number one?

98
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:48,949
I'll pass.

99
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,120
I've already decided not to gamble.

100
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,750
Obviously, I will bet on myself.

101
00:06:57,242 --> 00:07:00,004
You're always at the last place every year.

102
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,545
Are you really you're going to do it?

103
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:05,216
Are you so sure you will win?

104
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,384
Have you forgotten who I am?

105
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:11,641
That's right. I'm the head genius scientist in the Kisaragi Corporation.

106
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,350
Black Lilith.

107
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,769
Did she bribe the combatants?

108
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:19,271
Lilith is such a big spender, how can she afford to bribe anyone?

109
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,399
I bet she threatens them.

110
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,401
I hear what you're saying.

111
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,365
If nothing goes wrong, you'll win as you're popular with the combatants.

112
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,449
Look, the early results are…

113
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,612
I feel embarrassed when you say that.

114
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:37,540
You're very considerate to the combatants as well.

115
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,834
Anyone who noticed will know.

116
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:43,088
I…I've also issued a lot of strict orders,

117
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:47,759
and I'm not interested in the poll.

118
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,514
I'm very interested though.

119
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:54,266
After all, everyone is working hard for us.

120
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,725
Although, half of them are just voting for fun,

121
00:07:56,725 --> 00:08:00,146
I'm still very curious if my subordinates trust me at all.

122
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,523
Well, yes.

123
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,483
If you put it this way, this project has its uses too.

124
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,696
Here, have another one.

125
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,281
Th…Thank you.

126
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:15,452
Even if you don't say so, you're very concerned about who Six voted for.

127
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,377
Th…That's not true at all.

128
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,836
I'm not…

129
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,879
Damn.

130
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,841
Useless Lilith actually did something good this time.

131
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:31,970
Is this live stream synchronized with our world?

132
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,850
She is the senior member of the organization, but she can't act at will.

133
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:41,147
If this matter gets exposed, I wonder what will happen to Lilith.

134
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:43,523
I am already looking forward to it.

135
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:48,153
There's no one around us, so you don't have to hide it.

136
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,447
That's right.

137
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,907
We have already seen through it.

138
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:53,700
You should be frank about it.

139
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,456
Of course, I do care about who he voted for.

140
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,667
But, I can't hold back that feeling.

141
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:06,212
From the time he attended the interview, he is a big idiot.

142
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:10,049
But he continuously calls out my name while following me,

143
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,677
supporting me all the way.

144
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,306
Even though his salary is meager, he never complains about it.

145
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:17,390
I think that he has lots of complaints about it.

146
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:19,809
He won't disobey even when I send him on dangerous missions.

147
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:22,520
He was upset that he was sent to that planet, wasn't he?

148
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:25,691
Yes, he complains about it and acts reluctantly.

149
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,943
Sorry, I'm blind to that.

150
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,571
But does that matter?

151
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:35,863
We've known each other since the founding of the Kisaragi Corporation.

152
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:37,952
So I naturally hold some feelings about him.

153
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,455
That's great.

154
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:41,331
Take this opportunity to let out all your inner voice.

155
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:42,500
Wait…

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,085
Hold on for a second, Astaroth.

157
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:47,379
Please save your words until you and Six are alone…

158
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,255
Why do you say that all of a sudden?

159
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,424
Here comes the climax. Don't spoil it!

160
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:54,552
However, I can't be distracted with Six.

161
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,679
We're just a tiny step away from world domination.

162
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,600
When we succeed, I will fire all the…

163
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,269
Stop! You can't say that!

164
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,192
I'm the supreme leader of the Kisaragi Corporation,

165
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,775
Freezing Astaroth.

166
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:13,489
In order to protect the jobs of 5 million combatants

167
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:17,741
and their future.

168
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,705
This is…

169
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,384
Villainy points added.

170
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,929
ZASHIKI-WARASHI KAIJIN

171
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:56,990
LIVESTREAM ENDED.

172
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,960
Lilith,

173
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:09,711
quickly think how to comfort Astaroth.

174
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,504
Aren't you a self-proclaimed genius?

175
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,048
The word "self-proclaimed" is so harsh…

176
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,216
It can't be helped.

177
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,136
The reason why Astaroth becomes like this,

178
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,724
is because Six had heard all her embarrassing confessions.

179
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,562
If that's the case, then we only need him to say something nice to her.

180
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,691
Combat Agent Six.

181
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,902
You've heard what we said just now.

182
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:36,321
Now, say something to Astaroth.

183
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:37,989
Peek.

184
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:41,326
I've recorded the livestream.

185
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,827
I will watch it once everyday.

186
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,331
-No! -Villainy points added.

187
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,798
You idiot!

188
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,102
What should we do? What are we going to do?

189
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:58,969
Do…Don't panic!

190
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,938
Look at the results of the poll.

191
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,139
Let's check the ranking on the Ideal Boss poll.

192
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,224
That's right.

193
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,808
Just now, Astaroth was talking halfway about

194
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,102
protecting the jobs of 5 million combatants

195
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:10,773
and their future.

196
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,149
Th…That's right.

197
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,486
Perhaps it's because she is drunk,

198
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,402
that she is able to make such an embarrassing statement.

199
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,571
Don't say it. I beg you don't say it.

200
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,572
Villainy points added.

201
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,740
What are you saying?

202
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,450
Alright, come up now.

203
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,373
Astaroth, let me tell you something.

204
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:28,957
After your speech,

205
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,793
there will definitely be more combatants who vote for you.

206
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,586
You will certainly become number one.

207
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,422
I would rather give up on being number one,

208
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,091
than to go through such embarrassment.

209
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,094
Alright,

210
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,761
let's go and have a look.

211
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,499
BLACK LILITH FREEZING
ASTAROTH FLAMING BELIAL

212
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,332
Lilith has gained the lead.

213
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:57,778
Lilith.

214
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,322
You shouldn't use violence because of your defeat.

215
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:05,952
You sounded so confident when you bet with me just now.

216
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,831
And you remain the number one now, so I'm certain you're chea…

217
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:13,250
You're ruining our relationship by suspecting me without any evidence.

218
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,878
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,341
Sorry for showing you something undesirable, Six.

220
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,301
Actually, I also think that Lilith is chea…

221
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,385
It's impossible that I'm cheating.

222
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:27,639
Do you really think you can get away with this?

223
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:33,312
Now, longlasting competition among us has finally come to an end.

224
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:36,066
Alright, Belial. Stop dawdling.

225
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,525
Get me, the great winner, some cola.

226
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,364
What's wrong?

227
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,450
Lilith's votes…

228
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,077
have exceeded the overall numbers of combatants.

229
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,205
What?

230
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,505
You little…

231
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,136
It, as I thought, was hacked.

232
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:06,783
I've already punished the culprit.

233
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:09,307
Please deduct the votes Lilith added.

234
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:13,354
Forget it. I don't care about the ranking at all.

235
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,687
This is fine too.

236
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:17,566
Ideal boss ranking.

237
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,700
Whenever we start this useless project,

238
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,311
I will remember the first time we met.

239
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:33,561
To be honest, every time this event starts,

240
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,166
I will vote for Astaroth…

241
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,086
I beg you

242
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,169
I will treat you to a meal next time.

243
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,921
Look, what do you think?

244
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:41,715
Thank you.

245
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,543
Alright, give you another one.

246
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,427
I've done a lot of things behind the scene.

247
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:51,307
I've already said I don't care about being number one,

248
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,811
but you kept on doing these by yourself.

249
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,604
You're so stubborn.

250
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,524
Are you upset by it?

251
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:00,524
No.

252
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,320
Actually, I am somewhat happy.

253
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:07,072
I didn't expect to become number one.

254
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,325
Thank you.

255
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:13,245
No, I didn't do anything this time.

256
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,542
But I feel happy when you said that.

257
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,206
What's the matter, Six?

258
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:22,754
Well…

259
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:27,134
Lilith has become number one again.

260
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,394
Stop being so obnoxious.

261
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:40,774
Wa…Wait. It's an accident.

262
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,067
What are you saying?

263
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,942
I'm a genius.

264
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,071
Actually, I've a second plan.

265
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,783
I have to say first that it's not cheating this time.

266
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,826
However,

267
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,370
the number of votes has exceeded the total amount of combatants.

268
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,248
So this does not count as cheating?

269
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,919
I've recruited more combatants

270
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,922
just for this poll.

271
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:08,259
7 days break per week, monthly salary of 500,000yen

272
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,303
hired without interview,

273
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,346
Their job is simply to write "Black Lilith"

274
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,033
on the ballot paper for the Ideal Boss poll.

275
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,644
This is how I recruit all these people easily.

276
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,607
I've always thought about this.

277
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:26,486
You're definitely denser than Six and me.

278
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:29,614
We're already thinking about retrenching.

279
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,658
How are you going to pay the salary of all these people?

280
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,493
We can just produce bad debts.

281
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,245
We're an evil organization.

282
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,707
We can deal with these little things by producing bad debts.

283
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,542
How can disposable employees like combatants

284
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,087
have high salary?

285
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:47,589
That's enough about it.

286
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,009
You've proclaimed yourselves as an evil organization,

287
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,721
but in the end, you're just too good for your own good.

288
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,475
But I don't hate you.

289
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,642
Seriously,

290
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:02,020
I will be considerate and withdraw this time.

291
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,482
No, even if you try to flatter us,

292
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:05,904
you won't get away with this.

293
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,028
You still want to escape

294
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,654
even after you created such a big mess?

295
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,155
Alright, I understand.

296
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,534
How about deducting it from my salary for this month?

297
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:15,076
That is far from enough!

298
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,037
But I don't have any choice.

299
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,729
I'm a standard bishoujo.

300
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,290
I don't have a seductive body like yours.

301
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:24,627
As a standard bishoujo, I can never be like you,

302
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,213
wearing seductive clothes to earn votes.

303
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,172
Hold it.

304
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,340
Alright.

305
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:31,926
It's all my fault.

306
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:36,013
As a member of an evil organization, what's wrong for doing something evil?

307
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,891
Villainy points added.

308
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:42,395
Villainy points added.

309
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,065
I can't believe Lilith has gotten number one.

310
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,525
Did you vote for her?

311
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:49,902
That's impossible. I'm not a lolicon.

312
00:17:56,866 --> 00:18:01,957
Dismiss the combatants Lilith hired with Kisaragi Corporation coupons.

313
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,083
Lilith will bear all the costs.

314
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,251
Tell them that it's a mistake in the adverts.

315
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,463
Delete all the videos uploaded on NicoTube as well.

316
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,343
The poll…

317
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,016
The result means nothing to me.

318
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,893
But I still want to ask a question.

319
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,729
What's the matter?

320
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,231
I understand your character very well,

321
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,276
and I don't think I still need to ask you about it.

322
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,737
But just in case…

323
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,906
I want to hear it from you directly.

324
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,366
That is…

325
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,420
Who did you vote for?

326
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:42,896
Who did I vote for?

327
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,583
Of course, that's…

328
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:48,420
Hero Alert!

329
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,006
A lot of heroes are detected near the location of the appreciation dinner!

330
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,678
All combatants and kaijins! Prepare for battle!

331
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:00,891
Curses. Why am I always interrupted at a crucial moment?

332
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:03,684
The timing of this attack is too good.

333
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,520
Our appreciation dinner is supposed to be top secret.

334
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,272
How did they know?

335
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:12,817
Isn't it because of Lilith livestreaming the event to the whole world?

336
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,281
Come on, obnoxious heroes.

337
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,207
I will subjugate all of you.

338
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:22,202
Let's have a talk after all of this.

339
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:23,663
What's the matter?

340
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,416
Executives, the type of attackers is dreadful.

341
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,461
There's a lot of locust type heroes.

342
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,462
Take a hold on yourself.

343
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,339
Lilith.

344
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,468
You said you will subjugate the heroes, right?

345
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:39,602
Combat Agent Six.

346
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,223
After this battle ends,

347
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,976
I will ask you who you voted for again.

348
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:48,939
Astaroth, you've just raised a death flag.

349
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,817
Curses. How can I be afraid of locust type heroes?

350
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,443
My kaijins are much stronger.

351
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,823
I've made a lot of mistakes tonight.

352
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,075
I will redeem myself by defeating all the heroes.

353
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:02,910
You'd better remember what you've said.

354
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:07,332
Alright, everyone!

355
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,541
The appreciation dinner is over!

356
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,465
It's now a victory celebration for defeating the heroes!

357
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,263
It's quite troublesome on your side as well.

358
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:26,934
Attention.

359
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:31,896
I will announce now to all personnels in the planet invasion team.

360
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,646
From this moment on,

361
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:37,569
we will prove that the Kisaragi Corporation is the strongest organization.

362
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:39,946
Therefore,

363
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,537
you're not allowed to be defeated by the Demon Army.

364
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,423
Astaroth

365
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,259
THE BATTLE HAD STARTED
PLEASE CONTACT US VIA EMAIL

366
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:24,510
The way she ends it is good,

367
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:28,056
but since she doesn't want me to lose, at least lend me some points.

368
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:30,807
I have to move out tomorrow morning.

369
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,104
They are busy with fighting heroes.

370
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,980
You should give up that thought for tonight.

371
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,869
Given that you are in trouble, why don't you turn to Alice?

372
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:43,444
You can count on my intelligence.

373
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:46,575
I've already thought of a tactic to defeat the Demon Army.

374
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:47,491
Really?

375
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,411
You're great, Alice.

376
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,703
You're indeed very smart.

377
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,539
That's because I have good functionality.

378
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,711
We have to wake up early tomorrow. Go to sleep now.

379
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:01,462
Alright, I'm going now. Good night.

380
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:04,701
NEXT EPISODE

381
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:08,387
HOW TO MAKE AN EVIL SUBORDINATE CRY
I didn't expect that there is a tactic.

382
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,931
PLEASE STAY TUNED
It's Alice after all.

383
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:15,269
After all, I'm the one who suggest not to lend any points to Six.

384
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,064
If we lend him some points,

385
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,941
I'm afraid he will never be able to return to Earth.

386
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,571
I will apply for a loan if we face an emergency

387
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,365
and have him indebted to me.

388
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:32,161
I…

389
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,121
I…

390
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,416
I didn't hear anything.
