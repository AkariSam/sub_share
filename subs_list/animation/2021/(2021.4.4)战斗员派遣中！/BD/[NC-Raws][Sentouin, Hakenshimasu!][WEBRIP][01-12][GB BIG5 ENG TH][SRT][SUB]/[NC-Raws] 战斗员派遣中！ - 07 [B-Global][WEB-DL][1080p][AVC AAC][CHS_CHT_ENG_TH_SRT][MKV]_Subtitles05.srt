1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,088
What happened, Master Astaroth?

2
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:06,506
This is not what we agreed on before.

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,801
I apologize for the teleporting device thing.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,262
Sorry, Six.

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,763
I heard from Alice

6
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,481
that you dared to use an only-50%-success-rate device to teleport people?

7
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,977
Remember that when I come back to Earth.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,521
By the way,

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,911
I'll teleport you the new episode of "Giving Blessing to the Noisy World".

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,611
You like it, don't you?

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,535
Consider it an apology.

12
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,088
Is that OK?

13
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,650
What nonsense!

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,262
So my life is only worth a copy of "Giving Blessing to the Noisy World"?

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,079
If you are really sorry, just marry me!

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,390
Shut it!

17
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,164
You are the one talking nonsense.

18
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,459
At least you could report more seriously.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,984
And what do you mean that you cannot come back to Earth?

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,130
Didn't I just explain to you?

21
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,999
As the Head of a branch, I cannot simply leave my subordinates.

22
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,158
Just because there are only a few men there due to wars, right?

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,018
And as Alice told me, your subordinates are all young beautiful girls.

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,478
It's not important.

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,063
The more important thing is, where is my backup?

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,661
How long has it been since the war started?

27
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,070
And you only sent one weirdo to assist?

28
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,015
This is because we are also in a difficult situation.

29
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,281
The world is right there for us to conquer.

30
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:14,408
Heroes are combating against us in a large scale.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,421
Belial and Lilith are already on the front line.

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,787
But the odds are against us.

33
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,060
We are actually hoping for your return.

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,128
Old soldiers like me

35
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,879
are of no use in battles.

36
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,090
I will handle everything of this side.

37
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:32,801
I'm looking forward to your performance, Master Astaroth.

38
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:34,381
You are such a…

39
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,140
You said that you wanted to stay there, so just give me some results.

40
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,518
By the way, make invasion your priority from now on.

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,563
Are you kidding me about no backup?

42
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,626
Don't be silly!

43
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,067
I can make you cry even I'm over here!

44
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,195
You talk to me in this way because it's just two of us alone?

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,393
Do it if you really can.

46
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:57,200
If you say so, I'm going to start.

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,983
-Order! Spare no efforts
-Let me tell you what people here call me now.

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,168
-to build a stronghold for invasion!
-I'm Zipper Man!

49
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:03,665
Watch me carefully.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,628
-I was wrong. Just cover that thing!
-How about THIS?

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,181
Episode 7 Wedding Girl Liars

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,436
It's been a long time, Six.

53
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,169
We should find out who is the stronger one today.

54
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,643
You speak my mind, Mr. Tiger.

55
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,842
I'll use my subordinate's legacy,

56
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,993
powerful strike or something, to fight you.

57
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,734
Since when did it become a legacy, meow?

58
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,611
It's not fair that only you can use a magic sword, meow.

59
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,657
Aren't you a weirdo more powerful than us combatants?

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,616
Just make a concession.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,265
And you are so noisy meowing all the time.

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,080
I heard that you can become more popular if you put a "meow" in the end.

63
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,956
Really?

64
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,332
Can I do it as well?

65
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,727
Whatever you like, meow.

66
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,353
Then here I go, Six.

67
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,756
See for yourself how strong I'm now, meow.

68
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,235
Exactly what I expect, Tiger, meow.

69
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:22,303
Eh?

70
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,848
Oh no.

71
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,540
I know nothing about this.

72
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,396
Give me some help, Alice.

73
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,057
Help me, Alice meow.

74
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:33,565
I can't stand you anymore.

75
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,569
Alice meow won't give her wisdom to fools like you.

76
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,141
Stick them back together with rice and pretend you know nothing.

77
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,490
Just like that.

78
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,855
Where is Six?

79
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,701
I won't let you run away today.

80
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,370
There you are, Six.

81
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,372
With a magical creature standing by your side.

82
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,690
-Where is my precious sword?
-Oh no, this guy is so dead.

83
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,389
Give me back my precious sword for which I bear loans for five years.

84
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,963
Give me back Strong Fire Strike.

85
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,884
That sword just went for a vacation.

86
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,505
What?

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,305
It suddenly became self-aware

88
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,605
and went to find its true master.

89
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:08,810
Stop kidding me.

90
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,812
Even so, it should recognize me as its true master.

91
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:15,774
What are you hiding?

92
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,028
Actually, the sword just returned from its travel.

93
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,115
But it fought the Demon King to the end

94
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,949
and lost narrowly.

95
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:38,420
It murmured your name with satisfaction and turned back to a normal sword.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,675
Strong Fire Strike…

97
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:44,201
I cleaned it every night before bed.

98
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,283
I was overjoyed and failed to fall asleep the day I bought it.

99
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,812
-I can't see you like that.
-I held it in my arm every night when I slept.

100
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,187
Here you are.

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,298
What a sharp sword.

102
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,733
What a beautiful sword.

103
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,569
Give you as a substitute meow.

104
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,197
Master Tiger,

105
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,411
the first time we met, I knew you were an extraordinary guy.

106
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,502
Didn't you just call me a magical creature?

107
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,499
This is disgusting. Stop calling me Master meow.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,166
Isn't it nice?

109
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,711
Mr. Tiger just became very popular.

110
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,716
I like small women.

111
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,298
This huge woman is not my cup of tea meow.

112
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,552
Respect to you, Mr. Tiger.

113
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:26,636
So dare to say.

114
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,057
Incoming?

115
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,391
Six.

116
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,392
We should fight.

117
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,101
This is a great chance to do a deed of merit.

118
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:35,562
Mr. Tiger.

119
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,105
Can you defend the city?

120
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,355
Leave it to me, meow.

121
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,778
I can try this sword right away.

122
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:45,865
Then

123
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,466
let's celebrate today's victory!

124
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,576
Cheers!

125
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,882
A cup after work is just awesome.

126
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,084
Everything's on me today.

127
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,461
Enjoy yourselves and drink!

128
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,879
Thank you.

129
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,923
I like Captain best when you pay for our meal.

130
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,805
Me too.

131
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,971
But you use your money in such a terrible way.

132
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,807
Bad impression as a partner.

133
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,185
Don't praise me like that.

134
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,069
This is a praise to you?

135
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,961
He won the battle against the Demon Army every time.

136
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,067
Awesome.

137
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,401
So cool.

138
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,735
See?

139
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,528
Everyone is attracted by me.

140
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,863
Isn't it a dream of me having a huge harem?

141
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,447
It stinks,

142
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,177
Zipper Man.

143
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,492
The stink comes from your zipper.

144
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,867
Zip it up, Zipper Man.

145
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,749
You guys again.

146
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,173
-I'll stick firecrackers into your asses!
-Don't be like that. Be an adult.

147
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,625
You've worked so hard.

148
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,043
I'll give you a name when I go back home.

149
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:42,088
Snow.

150
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,507
Didn't you just be promoted to the Captain of the Guard Knights?

151
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,927
Why are you still in my team?

152
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,505
The princess sent me to supervise you.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,269
Properly use my diplomatic wisdom to make an agreement with you.

154
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,535
What a decent way to drive someone out.

155
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:58,158
Drive…

156
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:58,896
But

157
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,389
it is so unusual for Alice who doesn't eat to join us today.

158
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,761
This is a part of planet investigation.

159
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,028
I'm compiling the report submitted to the headquarter.

160
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,910
You guys are really wizards from a different world.

161
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,036
We don't use magic

162
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,286
but science.

163
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,329
What investigation are you doing then?

164
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,502
The food here may be poisonous to people from Earth.

165
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,754
For example,

166
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,507
do you know what kind of meat that is in front of you?

167
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,595
Captain.

168
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,889
If you don't eat it, I'll take it instead.

169
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,432
This plate of Orc.

170
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:36,975
Orc?

171
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,729
I still cannot eat the meat from creatures with intelligence.

172
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,988
Hurray!

173
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,147
I'll have it.

174
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,743
You are so tough usually.

175
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,692
-But you are weak when it comes to eating.
-The meat of Orc is the best.

176
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,193
Shut it!

177
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,528
Snow, you are on leave tomorrow, right?

178
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,283
Can you help me? I'll pay you.

179
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,158
Pay me?

180
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,609
I'll do it in order to pay back the loans of my precious sword.

181
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,828
What do you want me to do?

182
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,455
The content is

183
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,331
to investigate this.

184
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,056
Look! That's Mogemoge.

185
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,557
Delicious after being cooked.

186
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,739
The name is cute but they are savage.

187
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,063
By the way, the one being eaten is Bobo snake.

188
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,190
Also delicious.

189
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,274
Bobo snake is fighting back.

190
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,443
The snakes on this planet fight with their whipping tails.

191
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,861
Interesting.

192
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:34,365
This is the unique skill of Bobo snake, which is rare to see.

193
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,618
So lucky for us to see it.

194
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,205
We get some interesting information.

195
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,028
Let's move on to the next place.

196
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,581
Don't talk with such leisure.

197
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,416
Run before we are discovered.

198
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,171
Snow,

199
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,131
why is that snake hung in the tree?

200
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,761
This is Headbreaker's way to mark their domains.

201
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,553
Let's go back.

202
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,181
That's dangerous.

203
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,017
Do you even have a detector of danger?

204
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,602
Headbreakers are savages with a strong sense of domain.

205
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,389
They get the name because they break the heads of preys with blunts.

206
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,068
You don't need to explain anymore.

207
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:12,445
I started to feel strange sights just now.

208
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,268
It seems that they are signaling their companions.

209
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,533
You're always right, Alice.

210
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,788
This is the sound they make when they call for their companions.

211
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,758
You…

212
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,140
I thought they were following me.

213
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,767
Useless fools!

214
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,475
I'll teach them a lesson when I find them!

215
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:46,772
Whatever.

216
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,149
I made a slight mistake leaving them behind.

217
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,859
I therefore will not lecture them.

218
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,063
If you're around, just show yourselves.

219
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,557
I'm not angry anymore…

220
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,630
This guy

221
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,548
is hurt.

222
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,296
Are you willing to treat me as your companion?

223
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,022
To think it twice,

224
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,480
I know little of this planet.

225
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:34,570
This guy may be a gentle creature after all.

226
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,570
Yes,

227
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,197
though we are from different planets and races,

228
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,073
since we meet in this forest,

229
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,119
we can be friends.

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,416
Try this!

231
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,803
HALF FOR THE SHOP

232
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,113
You're going to eat my friend with soy sauce right in front of me?

233
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,768
You cold-blooded woman.

234
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,428
What's wrong with this guy?

235
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,647
I helped you and you don't even know how to say thanks?

236
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,649
Easy you two.

237
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,609
Listen to me,

238
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,224
I was taken to the Zenarith Gathering by Grimm.

239
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,405
And she conjured the Deadly Monsters after a creepy ritual.

240
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,548
That was so scary.

241
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,115
Rose,

242
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,951
there are so many delicious foods to eat,

243
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,015
so shut up and eat!

244
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,913
Grimm,

245
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:28,249
you conjured those monsters again?

246
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,500
So what?

247
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,754
I'm a believer of Master Zenarith who is in charge of death and disasters.

248
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,639
It's not a fault to conjure them…

249
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,883
Ouch!

250
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,759
Grimm,

251
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,720
do you mean the so-called ghosts or zombies?

252
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,100
Yes, I conjured ghosts just now.

253
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,142
Six,

254
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,351
those are basic types of supernatural beings.

255
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,446
The existence against me, a scientific product.

256
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,818
The moment magic appears in the planet, they are no surprise.

257
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,514
And magic is some kind of superpower researched by Kisaragi Corporation.

258
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,514
Heine of the Flame's magic is a fire-starting power by psychokinesis.

259
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,706
In other words, just the sixth sense.

260
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,166
Fire? Sexy?

261
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,250
Are you talking about something erotic?

262
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,461
I mean ghosts are more dubious than magic.

263
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,125
Alice,

264
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,009
careful about suspecting Zenarith's power. You may suffer the wrath of Him.

265
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,802
Curses are hypnotism with strong self-implication.

266
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,821
Zenarith is something made up.

267
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,847
What did you say?

268
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,269
But Grimm was still alive without a head.

269
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,937
A lizard's tail can also grow back.

270
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:36,692
This guy may be an unknown creature under human skin.

271
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:37,567
Fine.

272
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,692
If you say so, I will let you see for yourself.

273
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,251
I cannot spare you after you said Master Zenarith was made up.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,366
You're most welcome.

275
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,994
I will fight back with the power of science.

276
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,091
How is it also my problem?

277
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,793
What are you saying, Captain?

278
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,532
You are of course a witness of miracle.

279
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:06,846
Right, Six.

280
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,850
I will get the evidence of a liar with my own hands.

281
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,476
Then she'll have no excuse.

282
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,730
You little big-mouth.

283
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,813
You'll go to hell after death.

284
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,288
The always pretending Alice,

285
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,363
I'll make you shudder out of fear.

286
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,322
Watch.

287
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,655
These are brought from the meat shop,

288
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,831
poor and powerless oblations.

289
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,543
Captain,

290
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,379
you are my special assistant today.

291
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,589
When you see my signal,

292
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,860
send this kid to the face of Zenarith.

293
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,133
No way.

294
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,698
You were the flamen of an evil god but you cannot do such a simple thing?

295
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,638
You useless Captain!

296
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,350
And Master Zenarith is no evil god.

297
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,225
What?

298
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,227
Just swing this on her.

299
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,986
Do you even have a human heart?

300
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,897
Exactly,

301
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,606
where is your conscience?

302
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,691
Bio-robots don't have such things.

303
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,780
Fine.

304
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,365
I knew it.

305
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,366
Come,

306
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,744
there is some processed meat.

307
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,245
I'm going to use it today.

308
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,821
Bring it out from the beginning.

309
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,116
You're saved.

310
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:21,336
I can't stand being looked down on all the time.

311
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,381
Let you see the real power of a flamen.

312
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,344
God of death and disaster, Master Zenarith,

313
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,014
please accept this oblation with hot blood.

314
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:34,559
Alice,

315
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,061
something seems wrong.

316
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,480
Just glowing. And you got scared already?

317
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,836
Maybe she did something under the carpet.

318
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,749
In your sacred name,

319
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,736
send your servant here.

320
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,452
Oh, this doesn't look good.

321
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,871
Isn't this how it looks like when the Evil Lord shows up in the end?

322
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,457
Oh my!

323
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,222
You summon me successfully,

324
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,961
such a child with strong desires.

325
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:20,772
The last time I was summoned was some hundred years ago.

326
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,815
Is everything real?

327
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,629
A super erotic woman!

328
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,735
You're amazing, Grimm!

329
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,650
Amazing!

330
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,736
Grimm?

331
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,529
Who are you?

332
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,200
Because

333
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:34,494
I was supposed to summon an eon evil spirit.

334
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,413
But there she is, somebody I don't know.

335
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,874
Though an eon spirit is also not something you can simply send away,

336
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,493
this one here, likewise,

337
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,460
I don't think she'll go back after hearing a simple "sorry".

338
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:43,754
What?

339
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,548
Did you summon me because you wanted your wish fulfilled?

340
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,298
Wish?

341
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,426
You can fulfill whatever wish?

342
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,594
Yes.

343
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,095
Nothing is impossible for me.

344
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,306
I can fulfill every desire.

345
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,225
Then…

346
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,433
Can you make me the King with the biggest harem?

347
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,480
Captain,

348
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,023
though it feels strange for me to say so,

349
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,483
you'd better not make a deal with a demon.

350
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,109
If you are afraid of a demon, how can you fight an evil organization?

351
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,946
Steeped in wine and surrounded by women is every man's dream.

352
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:12,782
I get it.

353
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,477
Then trade with your soul…

354
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,788
You use a cheap 3D projector, don't you?

355
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,634
3D projector? What's that, shortie?

356
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,061
Don't say something dreamless, shortie.

357
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,881
This is Master Demon.

358
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,077
Yes, I'm the Head Demon as famous as Zenarith.

359
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,260
My name is…

360
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:37,258
Enough.

361
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,121
What are you doing?

362
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,183
Stop being rude.

363
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,644
Stop it, Alice.

364
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,811
Don't interrupt me.

365
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,645
Shut up.

366
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,605
You stop interrupting my investigation.

367
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,525
Where are you really hiding?

368
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,279
You recognize that I'm not really here, I see.

369
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,364
My desire is way important than that!

370
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,576
Are you in here?

371
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,411
I told you to stop.

372
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,808
Investigate after my wish is fulfilled.

373
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,748
What wish? That's stupid.

374
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,458
Don't get fooled by such a liar.

375
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:05,460
What?

376
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,837
Are you questioning my power?

377
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,631
I can stop your heartbeat.

378
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,682
Bio-robots don't have hearts.

379
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,184
What's going on?

380
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,729
Whatever.

381
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,617
Then let me fulfill your wish and see how powerful I am.

382
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,766
Then,

383
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,298
create two or three planets big enough for men to live in.

384
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,819
Let me fulfill…

385
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,615
What?

386
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,700
Planet?

387
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,657
Yes.

388
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:38,992
Quickly.

389
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:41,203
Wait… wait.

390
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,017
Did you just ask me to create two or three worlds?

391
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:45,834
However deep your desire is, there should be a limit.

392
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,946
Didn't you just say that you can do anything?

393
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,644
Or just destroy every living thing in this planet.

394
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,759
The Demon King, Demons and Mogemoge…

395
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,844
Isn't it holocaust?

396
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,595
Right.

397
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,055
Mogemoge are innocent!

398
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,473
Do you have a more typical wish?

399
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:01,570
Wealth or power?

400
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,876
Or everlasting youth?

401
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,603
I don't need money or power.

402
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,394
Bio-robots don't grow old.

403
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,480
Please, enough!

404
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:10,273
You can't do this and you can't do that.

405
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,611
Any wish this demon can fulfill?

406
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,431
Right.

407
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,323
The toilet in the base is clogged.

408
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,201
Please fix that.

409
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,205
Ask a Head Demon to fix a toilet…

410
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,208
Who do you think I am?

411
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:37,098
Then… clean the toilet?

412
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,303
No?

413
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,303
What do you want then?

414
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:41,349
Well…

415
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,182
I am a Head Demon.

416
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,728
Well…

417
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,979
Sorry.

418
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,013
Enough. Just go back to where you belong.

419
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,537
Did some mean thing to that demon.

420
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,994
Whatever.

421
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:11,001
It is fortunate enough to prove my power is real.

422
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:11,670
Why?

423
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:12,796
Why do you jump to such a conclusion?

424
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:14,853
Because demon…

425
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,207
That was remote control or something alike.

426
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,593
Where is the proof?

427
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,964
And I remembered I asked you to conjure a ghost.

428
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,432
That was because…

429
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,057
Even though you want to lie to yourself,

430
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,602
do it better.

431
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,019
Low-level liar.

432
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,240
So annoying…

433
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,261
Alice said she wanted to see my power,

434
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,984
and that was why I worked so hard.

435
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:43,867
Sure enough, if it continues, we will run out of water…

436
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,912
Though I don't want to use it,

437
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,414
I don't have other options.

438
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:54,846
After investigating the ecological system and magic of this planet,

439
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,506
and after my examination,

440
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,787
I hold a skeptical opinion on the existence of demons.

441
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,179
My harem…

442
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,721
Had I been there,

443
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:06,653
I'd have had my wish fulfilled even if it costs me my soul meow.

444
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,559
Of course…

445
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,432
Turned me into a short girl, meow.

446
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,898
More serious than I thought, meow.

447
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,306
Pity but still, meow.

448
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,583
After I retire, I'll ask Master Lilith to make me a beautiful girl.

449
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,699
Stop meowing!

450
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:29,593
Besides, the existence of the so-called demons is not impressive at all.

451
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,334
Meow.

452
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,853

00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,556
Of course, it is from Alice. What an accurate report.

455
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,723
What is that in the end?

456
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:13,851
Meow?

457
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,727
Meow.

458
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,021
She made a mistake?

459
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,731

That's all for the contacting stuff.

Though the fight is tough…

461
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,027
(COMING SOON)
Just leave it to me.

462
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,904
I don't know what "failure" means.

463
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,030
I pray for the success of the combat.

Nooo.

467
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,165
This is not my style.

468
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:38,710
Then what's for dinner?
