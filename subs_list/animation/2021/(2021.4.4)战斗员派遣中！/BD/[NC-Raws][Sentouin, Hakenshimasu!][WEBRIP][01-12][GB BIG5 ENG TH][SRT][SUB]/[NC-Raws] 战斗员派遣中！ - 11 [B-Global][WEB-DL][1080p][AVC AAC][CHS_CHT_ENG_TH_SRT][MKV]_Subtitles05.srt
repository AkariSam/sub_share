1
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,397
It's unfair to always leave me alone.

2
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:09,801
I also want to explore the ruins.

3
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,137
We're not going there for fun.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,266
The Toris kingdom and Demon Army are both attacking us,

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:18,352
so we have to split our forces.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,690
The enemies are intruding here and here,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,986
And the knights will deal with the Toris Imperial Army,

8
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:30,323
while you tackle the Demon Army.

9
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,739
Are you serious?

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,222
Even if Tiger Man is a kaijin,

11
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:37,079
it's unreasonable to send him to face an army alone, isn't it?

12
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:41,375
You seem to want to declare, "Lolicons must die!"

13
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,920
That's exactly what I think.

14
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,923
However, I believe you're able to do that.

15
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:49,968
Look at this map.

16
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,387
Aren't you the King of the Jungle, Tiger Man?

17
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,347
What's this?

18
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:56,695
So, the ambush spot is in the jungle.

19
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:59,518
In this case, I can beat them up at ease.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,603
That's amazing, Tiger Man.

21
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,274
Even your disgusting voice sounds cool.

22
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:06,025
I'm flattered.

23
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,986
When the knights and Tiger Man fight against the enemies,

24
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:11,237
we'll head to Toris again.

25
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,865
If we succeed in stealing the ancient weapon,

26
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,325
we can threaten them to negotiate with us.

27
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,243
We're an evil organization.

28
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,206
Let's capitalize on them and take all the benefits.

29
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,167
Yeah!

30
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,514
Episode 11 How to Make an Evil Leader Cry
There's a war coming soon,

31
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,641
and you want to go to Toris now?

32
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:04,727
It's the right time to go there.

33
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:05,687
At the moment,

34
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:10,064
there are only the Demon Army's executives at the ruins.

35
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:15,203
Captain, why did you do that to the prince?

36
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:20,117
Sometimes, I think you're an idiot.

37
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,222
You're the same. Though you look innocent,

38
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:24,585
sometimes you are mean.

39
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,375
And you even want to eat me.

40
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:29,168
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,871
No matter how hungry I am, I won't eat you.

42
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:33,907
What?

43
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:36,008
We even had a fight.

44
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,260
Did you forget that night?

45
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:43,181
My debts…

46
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:44,850
Six.

47
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:47,421
Someone has been crying all this time.

48
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:48,949
It's annoying, do something about it.

49
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:53,109
Captain, what happened that night?

50
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,985
-I need money.
-I'm asking you, Captain.

51
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,437
-I need to pay my debts!
-What on earth happened that night?

52
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,700
-It's just a pay cut.
-Are you listening to me?

53
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:05,079
-What can we do?
-What did we do?

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,747
Look at me,

55
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:08,600
-I spent all my salary on the first week.
-Tell me what happened.

56
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:11,437
-Nonetheless, I am still enjoying my life.
-Captain…

57
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:13,711
-Life is not all about money.
-Captain!

58
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,507
That's because I give you an allowance, right?

59
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,178
You accept an allowance from a child?

60
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,680
As an adult, don't you feel ashamed?

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,050
I'm comforting you.

62
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,016
How can you criticize me?

63
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,644
Annoying.

64
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,685
Snow,

65
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:33,230
If you help finish this mission, I will give you an allowance as well.

66
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:37,891
If we can obtain the ancient weapon in the ruins,

67
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:40,141
I will give you a bonus worth three months of your salary.

68
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,867
Alice!

69
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,752
We're going to infiltrate the ruins where the Demon Army's executives are.

70
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:51,041
Don't be reckless like before.

71
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,668
I understand, Alice.

72
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,963
I will definitely be useful.

73
00:04:56,548 --> 00:05:00,593
You are the most pitiful person I've ever seen.

74
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,593
Shut up.

75
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,355
How can you criticize me while you also receive allowance from Alice?

76
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,266
Money is the most important thing.

77
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,615
As long as it's about money, I can even sacrifice

78
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:13,564
my colleagues, friends, and even parents whom I've never met.

79
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:17,235
I'm sorry to interrupt your shameless declaration,

80
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:20,194
but please stop calling me so intimately.

81
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,382
Should we invite her to join the Kisaragi Corporation?

82
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:27,995
I think she has the genes of a villain.

83
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,497
I don't think so.

84
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,249
She's more of a despicable subordinate like you.

85
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:37,273
With the bonus, I can have my second frost sword.

86
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:41,100
She tends to easily succumb to temptation.

87
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,007
That's true.

88
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,509
But I'm different.

89
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,605
I have a good rest.

90
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,100
Be quiet, you idiot.

91
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,521
It seems like we cannot take this ancient civilization lightly.

92
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:59,064
Six, the ancient weapon may be a big surprise.

93
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:04,156
Maybe it will go out of control and attack us?

94
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,658
I know that

95
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:08,244
because I've watched a lot of animations that have the same results.

96
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:12,247
Yes, it might even explode automatically.

97
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:14,458
Since they are still camping here,

98
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,543
it means we have reached on time.

99
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,422
I'm exhausted.

100
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:23,173
As hard as much we fight, the enemies seem to be endless.

101
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,134
There're also countless traps.

102
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,680
But there are only inches from our goal.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,425
I think we will reach it tomorrow.

104
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,892
Russell, have a rest first.

105
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,021
You've used a lot of mana, right?

106
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,187
Don't worry, I'm still energetic.

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,358
We combat chimeras have endless mana.

108
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,725
As long as I've plenty of food, I can fight all day long.

109
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:45,947
Well.

110
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:49,033
For the fight tomorrow, fill your stomach and take a good rest tonight.

111
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,454
Can you stop treating me like a child?

112
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:58,461
It seems that they are exhausted from exploring the ruins.

113
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,254
Yes, what should we do now?

114
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,463
Captain,

115
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,216
if we want to sneak into the ruins, we must act faster.

116
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:08,721
If possible, I advise to complete our investigation at night.

117
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:12,307
Otherwise, you won't be able to see

118
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,906
the contribution of my power.

119
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:18,250
I don't remember what contribution your power has made recently.

120
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,398
What did you say?

121
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,983
You can remind me of that.

122
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,778
Hold it!

123
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,654
I am Grimm, the archbishop!

124
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:27,572
You always count on me in a pinch!

125
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,785
Calm down, Grimm.

126
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:37,019
They certainly don't expect us to arrive at Toris that quickly.

127
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:38,458
I totally agree.

128
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,461
That's right.

129
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:44,103
Therefore, I want to propose an underhand tactic.

130
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,298
Underhand tactic!

131
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,134
Their vigilance must be relaxed now.

132
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,137
So, we shouldn't investigate the ruins first.

133
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,389
Instead, we sneak in…

134
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,766
Kill them…

135
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,305
Don't mimic her.

136
00:07:57,307 --> 00:08:00,814
Snow, aren't you a knight of justice?

137
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:02,565
That's right.

138
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,817
Are you corrupted by Captain?

139
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,778
What else can we do?

140
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,363
Two Demon Army executives are we faced with.

141
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:12,701
Six, Alice,

142
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:16,154
You should understand me, shouldn't you?

143
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:18,374
Are you looking down on me?

144
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,127
Kisaragi Corporation's combatants will never use such underhand tactics.

145
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:22,668
What?

146
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,005
I agree, Six.

147
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:27,173
That's how a Kisaragi Corporation combat agent should act.

148
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:28,259
Wait a minute.

149
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,761
I'm just following your lead.

150
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:33,013
She said she's following our lead.

151
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:36,725
How can she look down on us?

152
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:37,851
That's right.

153
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,729
Six, let's make it clear to her.

154
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,188
We are going to rest here tonight.

155
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,902
Tomorrow, we are going to tail them.

156
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:51,086
We will leave all the traps and guards to them.

157
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:54,534
When they are exhausted after reaching the end,

158
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,078
we will launch our attack.

159
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:05,046
Rather than conducting a raid tonight,

160
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:08,491
why don't we let them clear the way for us?

161
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,134
Good point.

162
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:13,344
Six, you are making a good example.

163
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:38,032
Different from the outside, the scene here is like a science fiction.

164
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:41,331
It seems that there is a huge gap between the planet's civilizations.

165
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,835
It should be a well-developed, ancient civilization.

166
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,587
After all,

167
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:50,380
they could create an amazing creature like that girl.

168
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,217
Rose, what's wrong?

169
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:54,525
Nothing, I…

170
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,724
The ruins I had visited before should be a different one,

171
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:01,351
but this place looks quite familiar.

172
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,269
Interesting.

173
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,147
Let's catch up to them first.

174
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,441
Snow, what are you doing?

175
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:08,984
This is a relic from an ancient ruin.

176
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,820
It should be valuable.

177
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:15,981
-But we are on a mission now.
-Can we leave her alone?

178
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,575
But I've told her,

179
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,711
-I will award her a bonus if we succeed.
-Alright.

180
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,918
These are robots, right?

181
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,962
They've fallen into disrepair over the years.

182
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,006
But you're right.

183
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,676
I guess they are used for security.

184
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:34,676
Wait for me, Six.

185
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,626
If I bring these back, I can…

186
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:37,971
Hey, let's go.

187
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,390
We have to catch up to Heine.

188
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,307
You can come back later.

189
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,519
Alice, you should come and…

190
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,953
This is interesting.

191
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,746
What are the power source for…

192
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,856
Listen up to me!

193
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:54,576
I felt as if I had played with these children before…

194
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:57,157
Heine, they're coming again.

195
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,783
This a new type of guard.

196
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:03,038
These are endless.

197
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,081
Leave it to me.

198
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,374
I will incinerate them with my flame.

199
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,807
I am tired of camping.

200
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,017
I can't wait to get back to the Demon City.

201
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,895
For a combat chimera like me,

202
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:29,022
I feel at home here.

203
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,357
But I understand your feeling.

204
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:34,778
You're a demon used to the modern city.

205
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,738
Don't be cocky.

206
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,657
They are so intimate.

207
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,201
Let's go.

208
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:52,629
Is it a trap?

209
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,714
Russell, are you alright?

210
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,505
Are you hurt?

211
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,094
Thanks to your protection, I'm fine.

212
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,192
You yourself are hurt?

213
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,307
Don't move. Let me heal it.

214
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,609
You have no need to do that. I'm a tough chimera.

215
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:13,042
I will be troubled if you get hurt.

216
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:15,817
It is the wish of all demons to destroy the Sand King.

217
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,111
And the only one capable of defeating it

218
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,365
is you.

219
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:21,698
Heine.

220
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,160
I see.

221
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:27,788
I won't die before I complete the mission.

222
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,460
I won't let you die even if you complete it.

223
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:34,046
After all, you're still a child.

224
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:36,589
It's my responsibility as an adult to protect children.

225
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,970
You treat me like a child again.

226
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:42,888
Alright, just wait.

227
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,014
I will also protect you when you're in danger.

228
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,394
Okay, I'm waiting.

229
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,812
Hey, I'm serious about it.

230
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,610
They are totally unaware of our presence.

231
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,610
Grimm,

232
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,528
Grimm, are you drowsy?

233
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,240
What's the matter, Captain?

234
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:03,866
Even if there is no sunlight here,

235
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:07,378
it doesn't mean that I cannot be sleepy.

236
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,413
Hey.

237
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:11,957
Are you able to put a curse on them secretly?

238
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:16,004
If we can restrict their power by your curse,

239
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,477
it must be much easier for us to handle them.

240
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,424
Good idea.

241
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:25,659
However, the curse could only be effective when I say it loudly.

242
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,726
Captain, I can't bear to fight with them now.

243
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,269
They are working so hard…

244
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,582
It's not the right time to feel sorry for your enemies.

245
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,359
It's about a war that determines the fate of the country.

246
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,861
Failure is absolutely not allowed.

247
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:41,528
But…

248
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,155
Bonus.

249
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,785
I'm a knight.

250
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,620
Since it's about my country, I have to fight.

251
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,750
Rose, get a hold of yourself.

252
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,753
I will give you tons of tasty food once we get back.

253
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:02,238
Captain, don't think I'm willing to do anything for food.

254
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,552
Except for this time.

255
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,557
These people are hopeless.

256
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,032
CHIMERA FRIEND?

257
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,775
Here is the end, Heine.

258
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,318
The place where our target is.

259
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,163
Is this your secret weapon against the Sand King?

260
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,499
It's impressive.

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,875
Yep.

262
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:42,364
This was originally intended to annihilate those monkeys from the earth.

263
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,802
We can use it to eliminate the Sand King,

264
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:47,513
as well as those irritating humans.

265
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,679
You are talking about it again.

266
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,183
Are humans so annoying?

267
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,644
Yes.

268
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,772
This is the wish of my creator.

269
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,981
Heine, don't you hate them as well?

270
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,884
I heard that you were tortured by them.

271
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:04,404
That's the nature of war.

272
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,666
If you keep those painful experiences in mind…

273
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,033
No,

274
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,785
I hate them.

275
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:13,328
I must kill that man.

276
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:15,456
I see.

277
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,543
Are you talking about that man you met in Toris?

278
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,171
If I catch him, I will leave him to you.

279
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:23,298
Thanks a lot.

280
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,924
However, if we activate it,

281
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,426
the war will be over.

282
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,763
Alright, Russell. I can't wait anymore.

283
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:32,850
Do you need my help?

284
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,934
No, just stay there.

285
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,731
It seems to be in operation.

286
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,150
Now…

287
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,946
Here I am…

288
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,450
Russell, Demon Army executive,

289
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,870
has been defeated!

290
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,038
Russell!

291
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,539
Hey, put your hands on the air.

292
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:02,004
Why are you here?

293
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:06,091
Unfortunately, this ancient ruin is now ours.

294
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,051
If you resist,

295
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:11,261
don't blame me for harming him.

296
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,140
You're so…

297
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,726
Wait a minute.

298
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,687
Are you following us here?

299
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,106
And take away the fruit of our efforts?

300
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,486
You are right.

301
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:30,769
We walked idly while you cleared the path for us.

302
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,283
How shameless you are!

303
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:35,725
We have gone through days of efforts to get here.

304
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,456
Despicable man!

305
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:41,230
Even as a man, you have conscience, don't you?

306
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,086
Indeed, but we are from an evil organization.

307
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,091
That's not the point, Miss Heine.

308
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,802
Who do you refer to

309
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,889
when you said you must kill him?

310
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,264
It's not you.

311
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,692
Six.

312
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:59,678
What? I'm busy now…

313
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,187
He stops breathing.

314
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,732
-Russell!
-Really?

315
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,400
It's a fatal attack.

316
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:08,278
-You're amazing, Six.
-Russell!

317
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,362
Russell!

318
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,323
Russell!

319
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:16,356
Did I kill a kid?

320
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,872
Alice, can you save him?

321
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,250
I can try by injecting him with a stimulant.

322
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,041
If it doesn't work, just give up.

323
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,170
Good morning.

324
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,586
What happened?

325
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:33,345
I almost killed you by accidence.

326
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:36,013
However, since we won,

327
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:39,934
we are kind enough to treat you.

328
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:43,230
So it's you who attacked me.

329
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,107
How could he say that?

330
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,901
It's him who frantically tried to save him, isn't it?

331
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:51,320
He even declared himself as the winner.

332
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,036
Even Zenarith will be shocked.

333
00:17:55,037 --> 00:18:01,172
You saved me because you want to steal the ancient weapon, right?

334
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:02,708
Correct.

335
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,835
Don't think that I care about your life.

336
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,298
I know it's strange to hear it from a demon's mouth.

337
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,890
but aren't you ashamed of your behaviour?

338
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,303
Cut the crap. Activate it now.

339
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:18,265
Then, teach us how to control it.

340
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:22,059
Snow, I think I've become a villain.

341
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,435
Don't say that to me.

342
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,027
This is for the country.

343
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,815
Yes, it's for the country.

344
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:30,067
Snow, say it while looking into my eyes.

345
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,029
It's simple to activate it.

346
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,991
Actually, anyone who is related to this facility can control it.

347
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,076
You are obedient.

348
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:53,173
Six, what was that?

349
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,634
Darn it.

350
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,650
It seems it's too late to stop it.

351
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,278
Six, destroy it.

352
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,075
Halt!

353
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,663
If you make any move, this woman's life will be in danger.

354
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:25,790
What's wrong?

355
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,585
My companions are avoiding me as well.

356
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:32,005
Russell, can you handle the situation alone?

357
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,840
No problem, I can easily defeat them.

358
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,749
You can send my words to the Demon City now.

359
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,346
This scene…

360
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:45,065
Tell them that I'm going to eliminate the Sand King and all humans.

361
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,353
Listen, Six.

362
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:47,979
We're even this time.

363
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,271
Next time we meet…

364
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,940
I won't let you…

365
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:54,317
Darn it, I didn't stop her.

366
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,320
Well done, Six.

367
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,114
You've obtained a treasure.

368
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,750
That bastard, Six.

369
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,669
At least let me finish my words.

370
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:15,047
What's wrong?

371
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,679
No!

372
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,017
Villainy points added.

373
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,686
You…

374
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:29,479
Retreat!

375
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,231
Stop! You monkeys who humiliated Heine.

376
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,356
I will crush you.

377
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,317
You're so noisy.

378
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,444
Do you want Heine's undergarment?

379
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,403
You rascal!

380
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,573
I'll leave it to you.

381
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:40,573
Here you go!

382
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:42,741
Idiot!

383
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,952
We are not like that…

384
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:49,248
You!

385
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,675
Captain, what should we do now?

386
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,095
He is much more powerful than us…

387
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:04,971
But how does he get out here?

388
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,099
There's no room for that giant to leave.

389
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:11,229
The ancient people are not stupid.

390
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,023
They should have made an entrance for it.

391
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,483
It doesn't matter.

392
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:16,984
Anyway, since he is going to chase after us,

393
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,695
let's prolong the time here.

394
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,905
That's right.

395
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,865
That giant does not have a supply line.

396
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,076
I don't think it can operate indefinitely.

397
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,917
Here you are. I've been awaiting for a long time.

398
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,544
Go back!

399
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:49,307
The ruins are not strong enough to withstand my attacks.

400
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,559
You can't rely on it to escape from me.

401
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,900
Wait for me to crush all of you

402
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,734
like insects!

403
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:34,999
FINAL EPISODE

404
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,291
PLEASE STAY TUNED
