1
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,506
There really are trees in the middle of the desert

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,641
With so many water fruits,

3
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,227
I can solve the water crisis and

4
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,978
be exempt from my demotion.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,161
Does this little fruit really hold that much water?

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,403
Yes, I heard that it was compressed inside with magic.

7
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,450
Magic… again.

8
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,496
This queer topic

9
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,557
always makes me feel my presense being denied.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,707
It's very annoying.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,125
You still don't believe in magic?

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,195
Be careful of divine retribution.

13
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,179
I seem to smell strong magic and meat here.

14
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,095
It smells so good.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,389
Hey, stop it.

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,390
What you just said is called a flag.

17
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:58,267
An earthquake?

18
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,104
Behold! Here is divine retribution from Zenarith!

19
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,356
Now, quickly apologize to me.

20
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:09,820
Alice,

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,406
I have a sense of foreboding.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,365
Everyone get onto the buggy.

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,117
Get ready to make a run.

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,968
Sa… Sand King!

25
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:36,305
This is the first time I see it! It's so huge!

26
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,804
So these fruits are…

27
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,243
A part of that the Sand King's body,

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,230
which is an organ for storing water, right?

29
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,566
Is it really alright for us to take them?

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,090
Alice

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,676
I've had enough of this planet. I want to go home.

32
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,831
Don't say such heartless stuff, partner.

33
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:06,084
This planet is interesting.

34
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,837
Wha… What are we going to do?

35
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,463
It's going to catch up with us.

36
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,591
Alice, can you drive faster?

37
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,883
Don't worry Six.

38
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,344
Later I will let out a signal.

39
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,971
Everyone will jump out of the car at that time.

40
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,930
You're kidding, right?

41
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,431
What about the water fruits?

42
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,556
Jump now!

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,742
The water fruits…

44
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,747
There's still one left.

45
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,457
But it's far from enough.

46
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,669
Did the mission fail?

47
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,006
That's not important.

48
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,091
How do we get back home?

49
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,127
Episode 9 Carnivorous Female Chimera

50
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,899
CROSSING THE DESERT DAY ONE

51
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,028
The scorching sun shines mercilessly onto our bodies.

52
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,115
In order to return to the Grace Kingdom,

53
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,367
we have to travel through the Tezan Desert.

54
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:49,831
It's hot.

55
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,958
You're too noisy.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,502
Your complaining will only make it feel hotter.

57
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,713
That's because of your clothes.

58
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,923
Why don't you take off your black armor.

59
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,483
It can help regulate my temperature.

60
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,177
Wha… You're so sly.

61
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,903
At least share half of the armor with me.

62
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,266
This armor is tailored for me.

63
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,521
If you think it unbearable, why don't you strip off?

64
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:15,189
If you two continue arguing, you will get hungry soon.

65
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,735
Only one day after jumping off the car has Grimm fainted out.

66
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,406
Six, exchange your remaining points for a tent.

67
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,992
If you don't, we are going to perish here.

68
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,369
You're right.

69
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,706
After all, we can use this for water.

70
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,791
Captain, I want to eat something.

71
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,545
This is the biggest problem.

72
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:41,036
At worst, we'll have to eat any monsters that we bump into.

73
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,425
It's time for getting survival,

74
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,052
not for being picky.

75
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,971
We will eat anything that we run into.

76
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,098
Understand?

77
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,559
No! I can't do it!

78
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,841
I really can't!

79
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,062
I really can't eat an orc!

80
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,105
Captain, you're the one who said so.

81
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:56,940
Stop being picky.

82
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,317
Yes… Stop being pathetic.

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,235
Rose, open his mouth!

84
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,778
Let me feed him.

85
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,154
Alice, save me!

86
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,156
They are forcing me to step over my bottom line!

87
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,742
Don't worry, I've checked its properties.

88
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,370
It's not poisonous so you can eat it safely.

89
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,158
I can't eat an intelligent creature!

90
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,666
Come, let me feed you.

91
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:18,670
Don't give me its head!

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,505
Give me something else instead!

93
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,223
Six, things will become worse if we don't find a solution.

94
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:32,057
So, I need you to do something.

95
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:33,767
Let's hear it.

96
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,271
Please take off Snow's panties.

97
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,024
Are you kidding me?

98
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,358
Alice, get a grip!

99
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,901
We can only rely on you now!

100
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,444
I understand, partner.

101
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,447
I will do it as your wish.

102
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,697
Don't do it!

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,617
Have you driven crazy by the heat?

104
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,057
That's right, stop kidding.

105
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,454
Have you forgotten something?

106
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,081
As long as I commit evil deeds, my points will increase.

107
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,189
If we have points,

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,795
I can exchange them for food or even a new buggy.

109
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,548
Why didn't I think of this earlier?

110
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:04,937
Since it's so hot, let me help you undress.

111
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,011
Go to hell!

112
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,930
Please do not do this in such a cramped place.

113
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,723
Wait until there are not any other options left.

114
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:14,391
I think we have already run out of options.

115
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,519
Additionally, both Snow and I have already experienced

116
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,730
skin-ship, like rubbing her breast and removing her panties.

117
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,858
Shut up!

118
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,694
Why don't you choose to take off others' panties?

119
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,153
Do it to Rose.

120
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,990
It's the same thing

121
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,992
Just let me rub your breast and remove your panties.

122
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,117
That's impossible.

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,242
Six.

124
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,904
Villainy points added.

125
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,005
Six, you…

126
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,829
really surprise me.

127
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,636
Cap… Captain, you're nasty.

128
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,053
No… You misunderstand.

129
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,221
It's Alice…

130
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,732
CROSSING THE DESERT DAY FOUR

131
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,937
It's the fourth day on our torturous journey through the desert.

132
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,648
There is not even a town appearing in our sight.

133
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,360
The daylight is scorching.

134
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,319
So we've decided to move at night.

135
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,737
Because of this, we have not seen any monsters.

136
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,033
However, our food supply has become a problem.

137
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,290
Harassing an unconscious person won't increase the points.

138
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,831
CROSSING THE DESERT DAY SIX

139
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,134
Maybe I can eat an orc now.

140
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,808
I've proposed to loan some points as the last resort

141
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,226
But no one agreed,

142
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,811
even though I succeeded before.

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,772
It must be because of Astaroth.

144
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,736
I swear, once I return back to the Earth, I'll use her to get some points.

145
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,407
There is something wrong with Rose.

146
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,826
She seems to want to tell me something.

147
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:02,583
She often stares at Grimm who remains motionless.

148
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,629
Rose is the kindest person in our team.

149
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,466
She must be worried about her good friend.

150
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:13,302
By the way, I am hungry.

151
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,474
CROSSING THE DESERT DAY SEVEN

152
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,517
I am starving!

153
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,561
I want to drink cold beer!

154
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,274
Also, let me be alone. Just five minutes are enough.

155
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,376
That's weird.

156
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,630
The points do not increase.

157
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,177
Are you being happy?

158
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,306
The system doesn't consider this an evil act,

159
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,724
which means you're actually happy that I flipped your skirt…

160
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:10,400
She almost killed me

161
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,198
Rose did not stop our quarrel as usual.

162
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,200
Instead…

163
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,134
Her eyes were full of anticipation.

164
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,948
That expression looks familiar to me.

165
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,196
I remember that.

166
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,428
This is the same way those mutant arachnid woman look at me.

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,768
When they are exposed to extreme conditions,

168
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,895
their instinct to breed will kick in and they will…

169
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,730
go into heat.

170
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,405
So that's it.

171
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,283
Rose has that look

172
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,158
because she's in heat.

173
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,788
Rose, don't worry.

174
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,249
I know your feeling.

175
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,375
It's because we only have one tent.

176
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:10,254
As a man, the lack of privacy is really hard to endure.

177
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,384
However, putting aside Grimm and Snow,

178
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:20,354
is it proper to do that with a pure-hearted child?

179
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,222
No, I can't do that.

180
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,799
As one of a combatant,

181
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,894
I can't do it to Rose.

182
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,895
So…

183
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,275
I can only do something

184
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,695
that's even worse than flipping her skirt?

185
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,798
We are in an emergency now.

186
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,842
I want to…

187
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:58,801
strip you naked!

188
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,931
Alright!

189
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,640
I've had enough of you.

190
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,683
Bring it on!

191
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,019
Listen, Snow.

192
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,231
If you make some sacrifices,

193
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,620
you can fill your stomach and be happy,

194
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,000
and I will also be extremely happy for other reasons.

195
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,951
This is a mutually beneficial trade.

196
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,238
Even if this is an emergency, I know you're bluffing.

197
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,245
But…

198
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,169
You don't want to die as well, right?

199
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,091
Don't you want to have a meal?

200
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,462
I do.

201
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,719
I'm not talking to you at the moment.

202
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:43,971
How about it, Snow?

203
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,018
If you agree, I will also give you rare equipment.

204
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,356
I will even smuggle or do anything you ask.

205
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:58,360
I can even pay your sword loan.

206
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,533
Why are you still hesitant?

207
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,912
You had not hesitated to sell your body to that old man, Engel.

208
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,832
I… I was blinded by greed then.

209
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,042
and Engel has a sense of responsibility.

210
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,751
But…

211
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:17,422
he…

212
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:21,427
I hate the word "responsibility".

213
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,740
You are wasting my effort, you idiot.

214
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:27,347
I'll never…

215
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,731
Are you alright?

216
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,033
Grimm has brought us enough burden.

217
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,493
Now even she also faints out…

218
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,663
Six, here is your chance.

219
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,835
Do it while she is still conscious.

220
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,232
That's not proper.

221
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,462
You coward.

222
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,342
It's because of your cowardliness that you is still just an underling now.

223
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,596
Bu… But forcing myself on an unconscious woman

224
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,931
is a line I will never cross.

225
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,600
Captain,

226
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,062
I can't stand it anymore.

227
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,313
Ro… Rose?

228
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,065
When I see you two, I feel…

229
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,149
Is it alright?

230
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,652
Wa… Wait!

231
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,696
It's not your time to stand out.

232
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,573
Let me do that to Snow first. She won't weigh on my conscience.

233
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,855
But I can't bear it…

234
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,828
I understand.

235
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:34,414
If you insist…

236
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,543
I'm sorry that I put you on the spot.

237
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,587
It's just so surprising.

238
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,880
Please don't say that.

239
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:47,638
I'm also clear that this is a forbidden line.

240
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,846
That's right.

241
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,224
We are teammates.

242
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,977
If we cross that line, it might affect adversely our assignments.

243
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,480
However, we are in a dire situation.

244
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,402
And, there is no one around us.

245
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,389
It is our instinct.

246
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,200
Don't feel ashamed about it.

247
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,743
Instinct…

248
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,455
So it's okay to follow the instinct in an emergency.

249
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,625
That's right. It's one of three original desires of mankind.

250
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:19,961
Yes.

251
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,298
I don't have any other options.

252
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,094
Yes.

253
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,633
But I'm really surprised.

254
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,802
I'm not aware that you're such a carnivore.

255
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,306
Captain, do you hate carnivores?

256
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,519
No, I like them instead.

257
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,230
Even if I say so, I will not obediently let you eat me.

258
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,621
I won't be able to get any villainy points if it is consensual.

259
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:44,985
It is the law of nature, right?

260
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,447
If so, I won't feel guilty about it.

261
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:50,825
Guilty?

262
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,703
Please take the fight seriously, Captain.

263
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,974
What? Are you asking me to take the initiative?

264
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,335
I'm okay with that…

265
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,754
It's more exciting, but…

266
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,202
And I really want to give my all for you.

267
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,841
So please do whatever you want.

268
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,720
Do whatever I want?

269
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,472
I initially wanted to be gentle with you, but since you said that…

270
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:17,118
Sorry, I can't hold it back anymore.

271
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,312
Wa… Wait a minute.

272
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,980
Let me clean my body with a wet towel first.

273
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,857
Those are the basic manners.

274
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,841
Let's begin right now.

275
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,486
I always think

276
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,696
Captain, you smell really good.

277
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,947
I smell really good?

278
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,783
You're unusually open today.

279
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,494
I think that is too hasty,

280
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,059
but since you like that…

281
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,830
Yes, I will try my best not to cause any pain.

282
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:42,375
There's no turning back, what's left is for me to start.

283
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,138
There's something I'm curious about.

284
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,972
We're busy!

285
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,100
What are you doing?

286
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,061
Doing "it" with her, of course.

287
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,144
Yes, I'll "eat" Captain.

288
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,441
I don't think you two are on the same page.

289
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,278
I'll do it with Rose. Can't you see it?

290
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,988
Meaning I'll fight with Captain?

291
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,366
What do you mean?

292
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,536
Are you going to play big for the first time?

293
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:20,352
We will eat the loser according to the law of nature, right?

294
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,626
Do you mean sexually?

295
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,961
I mean eating you literally.

296
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,423
Are you kidding me?

297
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,840
This is not funny!

298
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,093
Why do you suddenly get angry, Captain?

299
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,111
Didn't you say this is one of the three original desires of mankind?

300
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,596
And it's reasonable to follow it.

301
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,891
I did say it.

302
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,851
It's an emergency so I have no need to feel ashamed about it.

303
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,397
You misunderstand what I said.

304
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,152
Hearing you said that you don't hate our species, I am really happy.

305
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,988
It's so hard to communicate with her.

306
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,864
Is this so-called cultural gap?

307
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,411
Captain, you smell very good.

308
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,836
What you said is the same as earlier,

309
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,749
but my heart is racing for another reason.

310
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,681
My grandpa once said that

311
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,934
if you fall in love with someone, you will want to be part of him.

312
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,655
Your grandpa is right, but you also totally misunderstand him.

313
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,886
I'd better leave you two young people alone.

314
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,016
Come on!

315
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,683
It seems that I have to fight with you.

316
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:22,603
That's right.

317
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,315
We are destined to have this fight since our birth.

318
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,647
I am Rose, the Combat Chimera of Grace Kingdom's Guerilla Force.

319
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,778
Here I come!

320
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:36,761
I am Combat Agent Six of the Kisaragi Corporation.

321
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,660
I will use you to earn more points.

322
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,835
We should be able to survive with so many points.

323
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,422
Massive amount of villainy points added.

324
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,640
I want to go back to Earth.

325
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,101
Didn't you enjoy yourself yesterday?

326
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,811
Idiot, I didn't cross the line, alright?

327
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,964
I risked my life to sexually harass her. It's not worth it at all.

328
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,527
I haven't had meat for a long time…

329
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,028
Combat Chimeras are truly formidable.

330
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,948
She could fight against me, even though I used my all effort.

331
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,409
That's interesting.

332
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,913
It is more reasonable to investigate the ruins on this planet.

333
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,832
There is a town appearing.

334
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,796
However, the mission has failed.

335
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,589
The mission…

336
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,715
I've completely forgotten about it.

337
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,643
Toris has joined hands with the Demon Army.

338
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,188
They are preparing for invasion.

339
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,355
I understand.

340
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,150
Are you trying to make me work for you?

341
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,611
You should pay a big price for that.

342
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,930
Have you forgotten that you are the culprit of the situation?

343
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,284
I've forgotten everything about that past.

344
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,702
That's astounding, Six.

345
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,744
That just happened last week.

346
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:11,336
I ask you to take responsibility for your failure to get water fruits.

347
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,087
I hate the word "responsibility".

348
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,843
You're indeed a scum.

349
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,554
Since we're lacking water, prolonging the war goes against us.

350
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,557
Therefore, I have an assignment for you.

351
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,992
This map's intended as your reward for completing the Toris assignment.

352
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:37,064
There are 2,000 soldiers of the Demon Army investigating the ruins.

353
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,778
Heine and Russell?

354
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,862
Yes, they want to kill the Sand King by the ancient weaponry.

355
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,549
I need you to stop the Demon Army from obtaining the ancient weaponry.

356
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,045
I just need to destroy them, right?

357
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,253
Hold on.

358
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,798
Why don't we…

359
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,800
seize the weapon?

360
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:38,898
I want to drink hot tea.

361
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,903
I also want tea, as well as food.

362
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,948
Do it yourself.

363
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,910
Defeating the heroes

364
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,122
is exhausting.

365
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,375
Six, tea…

366
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,378
(NEXT EPISODE KISARAGI LEADERS, WILL DELIVER!)

367
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,313
If Six were here,

368
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,451
even though he had fought in the Sahara Deserts for a month,

369
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,260
he would quickly make a cup of tea for me.

370
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:10,513
You treated him like that?

371
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,351
And you want us to run your errands?

372
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,479
Six is surprisingly nice.

373
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,231
What did he write in his report?

374
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:21,775
Is he still fine?

375
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,654
I can't read anything at the moment.

376
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,531
Disappointed.

377
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:31,451
Let's take a rest first.

378
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,869
Agreed.

379
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,748
Aren't you forgetting something?

380
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:39,460
We will have a party after we wake up, right?
