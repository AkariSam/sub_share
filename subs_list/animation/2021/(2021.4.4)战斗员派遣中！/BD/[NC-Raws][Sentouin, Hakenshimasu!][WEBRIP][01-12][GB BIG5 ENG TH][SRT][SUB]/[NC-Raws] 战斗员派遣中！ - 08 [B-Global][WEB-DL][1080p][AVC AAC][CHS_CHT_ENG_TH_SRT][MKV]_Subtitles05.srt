1
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:10,375
Penis Celebration!

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:15,015
Penis Celebration…

3
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:20,721
Penis Celebration!

4
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:25,943
Penis Celebration…

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,572
Really had to say that in front of everyone, didn't I?

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,451
I understand.

7
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:37,454
Your Highness is at an age when you want to indulge yourself.

8
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:39,082
No… I'm not.

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,040
At the end of the day, you're the one

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,334
who turned a celebration speech into this.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,212
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,965
How could I possibly do such a stupid thing?

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,131
Come on.

14
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,758
Did you really forget?

15
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,969
So what on earth are you doing?

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,179
I know you called me here on purpose.

17
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,683
I called you here

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,146
becasue I want to tell you something.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,356
Sorry, Tirrith

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,983
I'm so happy that you like me,

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,858
but I don't like evil girl…

22
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,819
I'm not confessing my love to you.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,474
I mean I have something important to talk with you.

24
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,781
And please don't say I'm evil.

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,742
I want to talk about…

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,370
this ancient precipitation relic.

27
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,081
Since it was destroyed,

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,707
our country has been suffering from water shortages.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,450
We survived by importing water-making crystal

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,058
which can generate water from the neighboring Toris Kingdom to support us.

31
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,010
But now since we have fixed it,

32
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,427
I cut down the import.

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,805
At this time of celebration, I didn't expect that my father

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,141
would tell me he didn't want to deliver the celebration speech.

35
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,518
There is no sign of him.

36
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,397
Why don't you just call him?

37
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,691
We decided to find my father

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,278
while we sent Snow as an emissary to the Torris Kingdom.

39
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,614
I want to ask you to act as her escort.

40
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:57,075
You really didn't need to. Just call me!

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,858
But after all,

42
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,956
we only cared about our own convenience to reduce imports.

43
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,646
If we want to increase imports again,

44
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,570
it's going to be a difficult negotiation.

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,418
So, I told you just call me!

46
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,543
But,

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,131
I heard that the First Prince of Torris was known for his lechery.

48
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,122
Hence, I think sending Snow,

49
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,717
well I don't know about her personality but she has a pretty face...

50
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,676
Look.

51
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,305
I'm a bad person, but even I felt shocked after hearing you say that.

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,431
Please hear me out.

53
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,850
Please protect Snow if things go wrong.

54
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,604
Then catch Torris in bed and impeach him.

55
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,776
It's a serious problem to disrespect an emissary from another nation.

56
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,486
That's right. This negotiation must be in our favor.

57
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,116
In my country, it's called the Badger Game.

58
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,949
If you're willing to take the job,

59
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,627
I'll give you the information Miss Alice wants in return.

60
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,622
The information?

61
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:45,123
Yep.

62
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,252
It's about relics information distributed throughout the continent.

63
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,876
Actually there are some uninvestigated relics in Torris.

64
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,098
Episode 8 Corrupt, Scheming Knight

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,185
This is awesome, captain.

66
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,644
The scenery just flew by.

67
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,526
I am the wind. I want to be the wind.

68
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,569
Grimm, stop. Or you'll fall.

69
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,569
Six, let me ask you.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,822
Do you want to sell the mana-channel tool?

71
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,826
I know how to exchange treasures for money.

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,119
Look!

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,130
The deadly jaw beast is as slow as the purple and orange spiral snail.

74
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,583
I'm going to ger rif of them.

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,791
Speeding up.

76
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,389
Gosh!

77
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,714
Grimm will be eaten.

78
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,552
Told you.

79
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:11,019
Why do you always get hurt before a battle?

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,730
Are you the emissaries form the Grace Kingdom?

81
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,149
Yes, we are.

82
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,024
Welcome to the Toris Kingdom.

83
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,947
His First Prince Engel has set up a welcome banquet.

84
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,365
I see. My name is Snow.

85
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,244
I am the captain of the Guard Knights from the Grace Kingdom.

86
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,954
I am also Princess Tirrith's personal knight.

87
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,206
I've heard so much about you.

88
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,545
I've never seen the specialty of your country, water-making crystal.

89
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,005
Word has it that it is a very beautiful ore.

90
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,759
I would be honored to see it with my eyes.

91
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,468
I… I see.

92
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,975
Then we will prepare a few for you as a gift

93
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:49,684
And please be sure to say hello to Princess Tirrith for us.

94
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,269
Of course.

95
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,170
By the way, with our vehicle,

96
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,980
We can take more than a few ores.

97
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,607
It's OK not to stop her?

98
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,651
-For this level of civilization,
-Of course, I'll report to Princess Tirrith that

99
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,028
-bribery is normal.
-we were given a grand reception in Tolis.

100
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,365
Captain.

101
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,454
What do you think of my dress?

102
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,497
Impressive. Are the injuries healed?

103
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,000
性感吗? 我性感吗?

104
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,545
All I can say is that you're too old to flirt with me.

105
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,713
Great Master Zenarith,

106
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,382
please inflict harm on this man.

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,341
Curse him to be an impotent man.

108
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,596
Did I miss?

109
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,971
What the hell!

110
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:29,848
What are you doing?

111
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,934
Well, let's go.

112
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,521
As the representatives of the Grace's Kingdom,

113
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,399
we always behave no matter where we go.

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,442
Please bear with us.

115
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,031
Six, what do you think we should do?

116
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,137
Impressive.

117
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,288
-It's more serious than a simply mistaking someone for someone else.
-Mr. Hamel is so young and successful.

118
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,204
No… no.

119
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,959
By the way, Miss emissary...

120
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,129
It's too formal to call me Miss emissary.

121
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,548
Call me Grimm.

122
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,507
No…

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,218
That's not the point. May I ask why you are barefoot?

124
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,012
Because of religion.

125
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,807
I will hit her from behind,

126
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:16,259
then you make up an excuse that she isn't feeling well and bring her out.

127
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,771
I think Grimm is doing well.

128
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,858
But how about her?

129
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,442
Yummy.

130
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,903
It's the first time I've eaten so much delicious meat.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,365
That… That's good for you.

132
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,699
But you'd better not…

133
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,867
eat the bones…

134
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,454
If she continues to draw attention,

135
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,112
then we mix the food with sleeping pills

136
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,000
that are powerful enough to make an elephant sleep.

137
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,168
Okay.

138
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,586
Let's forget about these two for now.

139
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,798
The problem is how to deal with her.

140
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,548
Prince Engel hasn't come yet?

141
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,029
He is the First Prince of this country with abundant resources

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,278
and also the next King.

143
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,665
If I become an Imperial Lady, I will have a happy life all my life.

144
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,978
His Highness sounds like a great title.

145
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,607
But he seems to be a lecherous and fat prince with thinning hair.

146
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,110
Go tell Snow to stop making a fool of herself.

147
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,403
No. Don't tell her.

148
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,855
Let's watch how Snow will be disappointed when she sees his true face.

149
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,244
Aren't you a good man!

150
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,874
First Prince, Lord Engel is coming.

151
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,836
Lord Engel.

152
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,300
Nice to meet you. I'm Snow from the Grace Kingdom.

153
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,826
-That woman makes no bones about saying hello.
-Pleasure to meet you today.

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,014
What a beautiful diplomat!

155
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,100
Thanks for taking a long time to come here…

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,352
It makes me shy for you to say I'm beautiful.

157
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,398
You're quite masculine yourself.

158
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,817
You also have a manly look.

159
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,110
I'm infatuated with you.

160
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,364
I really underestimated her.

161
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,865
So did I.

162
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,179
As long as he's a rich man,

163
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,162
she even could love half beast and Slime.

164
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,831
Bravo.

165
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:02,404
Miss Snow, I'm self-aware of my look.

166
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,836
Enough about the polite greetings…

167
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:06,004
You're a charming man.

168
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,174
Please look at my eyes.

169
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:12,427
Do my eyes look like they're lying?

170
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,014
They… They don't seem to be lying.

171
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,350
The man is too easy to deal with.

172
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,437
He must be blind.

173
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,730
Thank you.

174
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,398
Didn't realize there were women like you in the world.

175
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,985
So…

176
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,071
The reason you're here

177
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,280
is to talk about the export of the water-making crystal, right?

178
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,744
After all my flirting,

179
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,203
why did you mention this thing?

180
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,246
Well...

181
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,875
I don't know what you're talking about.

182
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,616
But assaulting emissaries from friendly countries

183
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,754
can cause diplomatic problems.

184
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,339
How can you be such a coward!

185
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,092
I heard you're very lecherous. Is the rumor fake?

186
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,346
It's too rude for you to say I'm lecherous the first time we meet.

187
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,681
This woman is hopeless.

188
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,562
How dare you lie to me!

189
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:03,437
Since you have a fiancee, you should have told me from the beginning.

190
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:07,450
Although you're handsome, it's unforgivable to play with a girl's heart.

191
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,400
Miss Grimm, please calm down…

192
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,485
Shut up!

193
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,071
Great Master Zenarith,

194
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,780
please inflict disaster upon this man,

195
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,032
let him be a drowned rat.

196
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,201
Laugh.

197
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:29,129
Laugh at me. I'm a pathetic woman.

198
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,508
I got rejected by an attractive man after coming onto him too hard.

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,009
I even failed to cast my spell. And I made a fool of myself.

200
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,678
Laugh if you want to.

201
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,804
Alice, can you believe it?

202
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,725
These people are subordinate to me.

203
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,351
Couldn't make any more sense.

204
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,980
Ominous Feeling.

205
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,023
Looking after the house.

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,717
I don't understand.

207
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,695
Are handsome guys and rich men that nice?

208
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:55,780
Honestly, it's almost time for me to have a such chance.

209
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,938
If it were you, you'd also hope your girlfriend would be a beautiful girl

210
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,171
who has a beautiful body and is a faithful woman.

211
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:05,669
You buy the bio-robot for adult only pre-sold by Kisaragi Corporation.

212
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,510
Did you just say beautiful-girl sex bio-robot?

213
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,461
I didn't.

214
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,754
I didn't say "sex".

215
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,918
I found this when I pretended I was lost.

216
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,261
What do you think this is?

217
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:20,764
I know.

218
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,474
There are something bad planted in here.

219
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,312
Artificial man or clone or something else.

220
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,645
It's like a hibernation capsule.

221
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,066
It isn't. It must be a manufacturing device of a beautiful girl.

222
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,735
Don't touch.

223
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,048
You're stupid.

224
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,241
Do you have any idea how valuable this device is?

225
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,369
Who is this little brat?

226
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,836
I'm as important as the diplomat from the Grace Kingdom.

227
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,875
Master Combat Agent Six.

228
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,418
Be careful how you speak.

229
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,085
Combat Agent Six?

230
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,130
Did Gadarkand lose to people like you?

231
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,798
Gadarkand?

232
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,676
He is an officer of the Demon Army who you killed.

233
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,429
Like Heine said,

234
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,264
you look foolish.

235
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,224
My name is Russell.

236
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,062
The Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon Army, Water of Russell, it's me.

237
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,316
Russell, what's wrong? What happened…

238
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,445
Gotcha!

239
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,658
Although I don't know why you're here,

240
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,534
you're with me since you're sexy!

241
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,047
Alice, ask the headquarter to send over some handcuffs.

242
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,038
Got it.

243
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:28,624
Stop, Six.

244
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,542
I'm not your enemy today.

245
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,503
Listen to me.

246
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,633
Let Heine go.

247
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,302
Don't you see this?

248
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,931
God job, Six.

249
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,517
-You take a woman as a shield to threaten a child.
-Villainy points increased.

250
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,601
You're glowing now.

251
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,187
Ok. You said you're Russell?

252
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,071
You just stand there and watch what happens next.

253
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,403
Miss Heine,

254
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,320
you must know what will happen to her

255
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,783
-after a female officer is captured by the enemy, do you?
-Villainy points increased.

256
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,201
-Villainy points are adding.
-Si… Six, wait.

257
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:09,456
-This time we're really… Wait, it's so itchy.
-I scratch.

258
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:11,082
Villainy points are adding.

259
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,293
You are really an evil combatant.

260
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,962
Show me the true color of a snaky, sneaky little brat.

261
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,292
Are you complimenting or demeaning me?

262
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,259
Let Heine go.

263
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,802
Sneaky of you to take her as hostage.

264
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,654
Haven't you done this all the way?

265
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:29,768
Stop.

266
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,299
Unimportant officers like you must often say:

267
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,356
"Well, can I take him as my toy?"

268
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,639
or "I'm tired of it. Smash it."

269
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,154
I know.

270
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,490
That kind of words…

271
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,008
I… I only say that once in a while.

272
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,190
So,

273
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,414
I told you to listen to me.

274
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,833
And get your hands off me.

275
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,960
Villainy points increased.

276
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,298
Bastard man.

277
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,961
What the hell is going on here? Explain it to me.

278
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,763
Wh… What's up?

279
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,075
Guards!

280
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,730
Guards!

281
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,975
I heard that

282
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,015
you sold water-making crystal to the Demons, huh?

283
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,438
And you've formed an alliance?

284
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,982
What… What are you talking about?

285
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,985
We're not alliances. We just signed a non-aggression pact.

286
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,405
Because we know that we also can negotiate with the Demons.

287
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,658
Of course, I have no intention of being an enemy of your country.

288
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,410
Please wait, Lord Engel.

289
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:32,748
You know the reason why the Demons provoked war against mankind.

290
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,124
And you still speak like that?

291
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,625
Of course I know.

292
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,380
They were invaded by the huge monster, Sand King.

293
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,038
Their territory is suffering from desertification.

294
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:42,871
So they have no choice, right?

295
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,801
That's correct.

296
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:45,291
As long as the Sand King is still alive,

297
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,003
the territory of the Demons will become uninhabitable one day.

298
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,307
They're just pretending to reconcile with you.

299
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,225
What's more,

300
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,932
now the human is united against the Demons, but someone got cold feet.

301
00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,316
Your country might be seen as a traitor by the neighboring countries.

302
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,529
This woman has started threatening people.

303
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:05,322
No.

304
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,865
If you agree,

305
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,451
we can consider a complete truce.

306
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,578
How dare you say that.

307
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,373
I will never forget the dead soldiers

308
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,625
and the hatred of my favorite broken sword.

309
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,294
Our Gadarkand was also killed.

310
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:21,586
We're pretty even.

311
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,308
Thanks to Lors Engel, we can deal with the Sand King.

312
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:33,096
Because there could be some ways recorded in the relics to deal with it.

313
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,768
Tirrith has mentioned the relics…

314
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,604
Do you understand?

315
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,648
If the Sand King is dead,

316
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,942
we won't have to fight against each other.

317
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,447
However, Miss Snow is trying to threaten our country.

318
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,440
We were also kind enough to buy a lot of water-making crystals

319
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,828
that you stopped importing.

320
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:58,433
Would it be selfish to hope to import again now?

321
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,961
I don't know which is a friendly country.

322
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,215
The Demons or the Grace Kingdom?

323
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:10,552
Lord… Lord Engel will choose our country, rught?

324
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,433
Although what I just said is very heavy,

325
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,894
I trust Lord Engel.

326
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,273
Let us get along with each other as a proof of our friendship.

327
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,899
How… did you…

328
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,304
Lord Engel, I can also…

329
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,030
get along with…

330
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:32,241
How dare you seduce him. Are you an officer of the Demon Army like this?

331
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,409
Shamless.

332
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,701
Who are you to speak?

333
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,039
Lord Engel, am I more charming?

334
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,000
Lord Engel, will you choose me?

335
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,211
Lord Engel.

336
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:46,673
Why did an ugly man become a hot commodity?

337
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,884
To be honest, shouldn't this kind of good thing happen to me?

338
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,427
You're just a walk-on combatant and don't want to be treated as a hero.

339
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,932
I'm happy you both like me.

340
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,982
But it is not appropriate to tamper diplomacy with this trick.

341
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,148
Lord Engel, what's the matter with you?

342
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,775
You're extremely different from what I heard.

343
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,819
Until yesterday you were staring at my boobs.

344
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,948
Why are you suddenly a saint today?

345
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,909
I find it unbelievable myself.

346
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,077
Just before the banquet started,

347
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,453
I felt like I was reborn.

348
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,044
How could I be so vulgar before?

349
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,211
Lord Engel.

350
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,713
Although I have some shortcomings,

351
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,498
I have confidence in my look and my body.

352
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,509
Lord Engel.

353
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:33,178
I, Heine, is actually a go-getter and giver.

354
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:36,571
It's better to stay with humans rather than with the Demons.

355
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,393
Lord Engel, I… I'm more…

356
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,435
You two girls really are nerve-racking.

357
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:42,519
Come on.

358
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,815
I said I'm not interested in you.

359
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,191
This sleazy man…

360
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,070
I didn't expect that he said the lines the Buddha-like hero will say.

361
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,457
I heard Master Astaroth was taking a bath, so I went to peep.

362
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,375
And when I saw the Tiger Man naked…

363
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,298
I felt more upset than I did when inferiors got promotion before me…

364
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,746
when inferiors got promotion one by one before…

365
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,799
and when I was kicked off the roof by a hero.

366
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,634
Six, what's the matter with you?

367
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,596
You're putting on that determined face again.

368
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,642
You're not thinking about those filthy things again, are you?

369
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,059
Sorry, Alice.

370
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,936
I'm going to start making trouble.

371
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,605
Can you watch me in silence?

372
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:27,772
Sometimes men should…

373
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,651
try their best to do something.

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,528
I don't really understand it.

375
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,412
But I'm your partner and also the fellow of the Evil Organization.

376
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:39,076
Whatever trouble you make,

377
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,953
I will be by your side. Rest assured.

378
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,874
Thank you, Alice.

379
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,132
Now that I think about it, I didn't like you from the start.

380
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,676
You showed your huge boobs and seduced men.

381
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,471
I didn't show. And it's rude to say I seduced men.

382
00:18:58,569 --> 00:18:59,263
What?

383
00:18:59,359 --> 00:18:59,785
What.

384
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,057
Engel, bro.

385
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,809
The atmosphere at the meeting has turned so bad.

386
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,229
Can I do a performance?

387
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,732
So you're a man of talents.

388
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,442
Then please be sure to perform.

389
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,987
OK. Please you sit down. Don't move.

390
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,366
Six, don't tell me…

391
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,621
I'm gonna to perform, bro.

392
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,623
In our country, this is our legacy…

393
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,210
Maybe it's the most famous talent.

394
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,377
Pee on your head.

395
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,049
Villainy points increased.

396
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,102
I can no longer tolerate the extremely

397
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,728
disrespectful behavior of your emissaries.

398
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,481
We Torris Kingdom declares war on the Grace Kingdom.

399
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,568
Besides, I decide to stop the trade between the two countries.

400
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,279
I will implement various economic sanctions.

401
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,281
If you want to make an apology,

402
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,991
just give me the two emissaries.

403
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:06,248
If you don't agree, I'll resort to force to

404
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,289
take cruel revenge on you.

405
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,411
I didn't expect the emissaries I sent

406
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,683
brought me war in return.

407
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,884
It's no use investigating what has happened.

408
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,220
Don't be so depressed. Cheer up.

409
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,346
You're too…

410
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,263
We're lucky we came back alive.

411
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,728
Why did you do that stupid thing?

412
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,145
How can you call it stupid?

413
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,190
It's a banquet talent that has been passed down since ancient times.

414
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,634
If you're serious, then your country must be strange.

415
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,694
Come on.

416
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:38,738
You both caused a huge trouble.

417
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,740
Snow.

418
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,660
I will deprive you of your title as the captain of the Knights.

419
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,959
It's hard to get promoted back, and now I'm demoted again.

420
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,545
Since they need some time to prepare for the war,

421
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,046
they won't attack us immediately.

422
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,675
But how can we get our water source…

423
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:04,409
Think carefully, the ancient precipitation relic was fixed.

424
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:05,973
Now that we can't find His Majesty,

425
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:08,727
please, Princess Tirrith, devote yourself to…

426
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,560
I've got a good idea.

427
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,606
Do you know the territory the Sand King hides in the Tai Zang Desert,

428
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,782
accommodates a magical fruit called Water of Fruit in the center of desert?

429
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,528
Yes.

430
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,925
A huge amount of water can be squeezed out from just one of those.

431
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,201
Well... So...

432
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:26,410
Go get one.

433
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,829
No. No. I don't want to.

434
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:34,585
It is a suicide mission to set foot in the territory of the Sand King.

435
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,214
Don't worry. The Sand King only moves during the day.

436
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,134
So you just pick some Water of Fruit at night.

437
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,596
Unforgivable… Unforgivable…

438
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,767
Hammel with a fiancee and married Gilbert,

439
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:52,394
and all men in that country are unforgivable.

440
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,107
Grimm, there was one thing I was curious about last time.

441
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,568
If you're going to ask some boring things, I'll curse you.

442
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,655
Correct. It's about curse.

443
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,950
What happened to the curse I dodged?

444
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:10,946
Before it brings down other creatures, it will…

445
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,792
The impotent curse that no one knows where it is.

446
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,171
And the lecherous Prince who suddenly lost interest in women.

447
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,713
Well, captain.

448
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,707
Are you curious about the connection between them?

449
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,925
No.

450
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,803
Everybody, listen to me.

451
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,471
This woman made a huge mistake.

452
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:31,058
I… I protected Snow's chastity.

453
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,270
We girls must cherish our bodies.

454
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,981
You're too old to be called a girl.

455
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,192
Great Master Zenarith,

456
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,111
please inflict disaster on this man.

457
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,654
It's better to make him so sick that he can't even masturbate.

458
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,489
Stop it.

459
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:47,701
If it comes true, you will make it up to me with your body.

460
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,451
My puppet.

461
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,328
You guys are so noisy.

462
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,749
I'm gonna to take part in the banquet held in the castle.

463
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,626
There is no useful information.

464
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,172
Six seems to enjoy himself.

465
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,718
I'm so tired that we've fought with hero.

466
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,019
The banquet isn't funny at all.

467
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:07,971
I think so.

468
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:11,724
(Episode 9 Carnivorous Chimera)
Just many ugly leaders and some mobs pleasing them.

469
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:12,641
(PLEASE STAY TUNED)
There are lots of bribes

470
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,144
and dirty deals.

471
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,708
Corruption permeates the air.

472
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,273
Open your mouth.

473
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,441
What?

474
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,778
Partners and cakes make us happy.

475
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,655
Come on.

476
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,740
You're enough.

477
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:30,492
Anyway, the sugar has been replenished.

478
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:33,273
I'm so diligent. I'm going to do some exercise.

479
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:34,327
So do I.

480
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,335
If we defeat heroes, let's have a party.

481
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,542
Great.
