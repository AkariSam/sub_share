00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,954
Episode 2 Repel the Competitors

2
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,305
This is nothing.

3
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,894
So many elderlies and young women.

4
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,272
Because in the battles against the demons

5
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,649
we lost a lot of young men.

6
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,150
So…

7
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:50,944
is Alice really gonna join Six's troop?

8
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,989
My high performance allows me do everything. OK?

9
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,034
Here they're called the staff officer and the military doctor, right?

10
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:58,501
I can do both, really.

11
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:00,370
I see.

12
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,914
These are their resumes.

13
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:03,750
Just skim through them.

14
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:04,727
Skim?

15
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:07,781
You just got her. You don't know these soldiers' habits yet.

16
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,087
I will choose the members

17
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,590
Pause the training.

18
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,967
We're gonna recruit a troop.

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,264
What do you think, Six?

20
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:21,725
The God of War, Alexandre·Gleipnir is good.

21
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,061
His name also looks powerful.

22
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:25,520
No, he's old enough to be your grandfather.

23
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,899
I'm not saying him, but these two girls.

24
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,848
Compared with that of others,
their fighting counts are incredibly high.

25
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,944
We want to recruit two members.

26
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,778
The first one is…

27
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,384
What are you doing!?

28
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:38,659
Snow, choose these two girls as our members.

29
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,370
These two girls?

30
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,537
Cut the crap and introduce them to us now.

31
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,580
Rosie!

32
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:47,042
I'm Rosie.

33
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,461
Yes, I'm the artificially synthesized Orcish for battles.

34
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:54,508
Do you really know how to control me?

35
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,218
My name is Combat Agent Six.

36
00:02:57,462 --> 00:03:00,098
Yes, I'm the battle machine who was physically transformed

37
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:03,140
and has abandoned the past as well as my original name.

38
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,104
Nice to meet you, the artificially synthesized Orcish for battles.

39
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,925
I'm Miss Alice Kisaragi.

40
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:13,683
We'll have good control over even self-righteous kids like you.

41
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:14,527
Don't worry.

42
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:16,655
Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,658
My grandfather who made me told me

44
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,534
to do so when making self-introduction.

45
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:24,454
After all, it was Grandpa's last words.

46
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:27,873
You can absorb the power of what you eat?

47
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,793
Yes.

48
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:30,752
Though I can't do this by just eating one or two bites,

49
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,526
if I keep eating the warmonsters of the same kinds,

50
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,381
I can absorb their attributes.

51
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,218
Recently I've been eating the powerful unicorns

52
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,806
and the explosive lizards who can breathe fire.

53
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,515
Therefore, I also have a small horn and a tail.

54
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,270
I smell something sweet!

55
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,730
Do you mean this?

56
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,067
Calorie Z, the popular and nutritionally balanced food.

57
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,155
If you'd like some, I can share it with you.

58
00:03:57,156 --> 00:04:00,395
But in return, you have to follow all my orders.

59
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:01,992
All your orders?

60
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:02,784
That't it.

61
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,918
-I've known how to deal with this guy.
-But the irresistible smell…

62
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,580
Next, Green.

63
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,580
Come here.

64
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,003
Glad to see you.

65
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,130
I'm Green.

66
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,677
First, I have the most important question for the leader.

67
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:21,678
What's it?

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,512
Are you married?

69
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,807
Do you have a girlfriend?

70
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,892
By the way, I'm single.

71
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,062
I'm such a nice woman,

72
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,355
but somehow I don't have a boyfriend.

73
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,108
I'm single.

74
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,903
And I'm also such an outstanding young man,

75
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,971
but somehow I don't have a girlfriend.

76
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:40,281
Exactly!

77
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,115
What are you two talking about?

78
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:43,742
Be more serious!

79
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:44,826
Yes, Madam.

80
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,809
Is Green a magician?

81
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,791
Why are you looking at like that?

82
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,418
Properly speaking, I'm not a real magician.

83
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,755
I just borrow the power of the great Lord Zenaris

84
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:59,132
to play the agent of miracles.

85
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,887
Who's the Lord Zenaris you just mentioned?

86
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:06,223
He's the great lord in charge of immortality and disasters.

87
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:08,451
Disasters? So he's an evil lord.

88
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,341
You rude man, will get karma!

89
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:14,483
Kiddo,

90
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:18,192
you must be very curious about the view under my dress.

91
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:22,531
Apologize sincerely for calling Lord Zenaris the evil lord.

92
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,365
Then I'll baptize you by showing you…

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,411
Villainy points increased.

94
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,706
What? Surprisingly it's not the pure style.

95
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,375
I didn't really mean to show you!

96
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,932
You'll be responsible for me, right?

97
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:38,297
You'll take care of me and make me a full-time housewife.

98
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,535
You have to do so!

99
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:40,985
I definitely won't let you run away!

100
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,326
Oh God, she's a virago.

101
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,634
What did you say?

102
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,153
Calm down, you freak wearing pants with laces.

103
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:47,932
Don't call me that!

104
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:51,559
The Chicken Club said
it'd be easy to make a boyfriend if I wear this!

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,437
-Can't believe you chose them…
-Fine, I'll show you mine later.

106
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,730
-Let's help each other during this short time.
-Then we're even, Black Pants.

107
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,858
Stop calling me that!

108
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,237
As long as I'm the commander, we can win the war nicely.

109
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,072
Princess also trusts me deeply.

110
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,406
If I'm the commander,

111
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,033
I'm sure that we can get back to our formal position soon.

112
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:09,119
But it's me the leader, you idiot.

113
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,081
No one wants to follow your orders. You have been demoted.

114
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,247
Stop the demotion talk.

115
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,416
Besides,

116
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:18,216
If our teamleader is you, a silly man with evil armor and ichthyic eyes,

117
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:19,754
it will ruin my reputation.

118
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,173
What are you saying…

119
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,175
I don't think you're knowledgeable

120
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:28,004
I graduated from the best university in this country.

121
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,266
I'm a high school dropout.

122
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,060
If you've understood, swear that you'll follow my orders.

123
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,769
Then you won't bring shame on yourself on the battlefield.

124
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:39,608
What? You want a fight?

125
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,028
Go ahead. Never mind if I'm a woman.

126
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,307
Come on. If you have the guts, hit me.

127
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,324
You bastard!

128
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:55,665
Villainy points increased.

129
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,752
Calm down.

130
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,567
I apologize.

131
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:04,699
I'm gonna kill you…

132
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,716
Stop!

133
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,886
What's wrong with you?

134
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,142
Princess Tirrith.

135
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:12,514
Hey, are you gonna wield your sword in front of the princess?

136
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,687
From now on, watch your back.

137
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,802
I only grabbed her breasts and she got so mad.

138
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:25,987
Mr. Six, why did you do such a silly thing?

139
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,113
Snow is a girl who can't take a joke.

140
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:34,218
She is a slum orphan who became a knight with unceasing efforts…

141
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:37,375
I thought she was a darling daughter of some rich family.

142
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,752
By the way, why did you com here, Your Highness?

143
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,754
Actually, it's because there's no empty dorm…

144
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,466
We have no other choice.

145
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:51,788
For the sake of the mission, living in the same room is more convenient.

146
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,708
Hey, don't do anything weird just because I'm a pretty girl.

147
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,105
I don't have the reproductive function, so I can't do anything to you.

148
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,730
No one wants to do that kind of thing with a robot.

149
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:04,692
It seems this lamp is not electric.

150
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,612
We can't underestimate the civilization of this place.

151
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:08,863
And that ancient relic.

152
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:11,031
There are so many things that we must investigate.

153
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,076
There will always be methods.

154
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,745
We'd better do something big to make a great contribution immediately.

155
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,999
Then we can ask for a secret base as reward.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,668
It's a good thing that you still remember our mission.

157
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,543
But,

158
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,947
if you look down upon the people here, you'll suffer from it.

159
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,931
Why hasn't the sun died…?

160
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,437
You want to stupidly attack the enemy from the front?

161
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:42,981
Is this the way you usually fight?

162
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:46,150
Attacking the strong enemy in the face makes the biggest contribution.

163
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,946
What do you want to do hiding here?

164
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:51,115
Of course we're gonna ruin the supply unit.

165
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,783
How despicable, Six!

166
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,160
The supply unit is formed by demons of low levels.

167
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:57,203
Attacking a unit like that makes no contribution!

168
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:58,581
Snow, listen to me.

169
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,623
Our enemies are the strong demons.

170
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,625
But without supplies, they also have to retreat.

171
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,130
We can repel the enemy by destroying only one of their units.

172
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,173
I do understand what you said…

173
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:11,926
You quite listen to Alice.

174
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,096
Teamleader, I also want to fight against the strong enemy.

175
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,389
Grandpa's last words said

176
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,821
to eat every warmonster in the world to become the strongest Orcish.

177
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,520
Grandpa…

178
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,734
I do want to respect your feelings for your grandpa…

179
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,820
Warmonsters are tasty when they're fresh.

180
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,740
Give me back my conscience, you goddamed gluttonous Orcish.

181
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:38,037
Rosie, I'll leave the food of the enemy's supplies to you.

182
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,413
Let's go attack the supply unit!

183
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,164
Wait!

184
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,041
I still think that we should attack the main force.

185
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,294
I have to make a great contribution.

186
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:49,214
Due to the demotion, I receive less salary.

187
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,076
My Scorching Fire Strike might be taken back because I can't pay the loan.

188
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,807
Just leave this to this man.

189
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,726
He's good at exaggerating the results in reports.

190
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,937
He does look like he's good at playing tricks.

191
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,480
Be careful, I'm gonna grab your breasts again.

192
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,576
None of you will go through here!

193
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,663
We're ambushed!

194
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,714
If you don't want to die, leave the supplies and run.

195
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:31,869
Run.

196
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,221
Anyone who resists will get killed.

197
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:44,768
Leader, I feel as if I've become the accomplice of some evil fight.

198
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,797
Why?

199
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:50,581
They're written in the Kisaragi Codes  for inducing to capitulate.

200
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:53,395
Codes…? What are you talking about, leader?

201
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:57,448
Rosie, take whatever you like.

202
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,241
And burn the rest.

203
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,909
Teamleader, you're the best!

204
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,039
Let the demons know how scary we are!

205
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,750
Sink in the fire of my fury.

206
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,586
Sleep under the ground. The red fire!

207
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,971
You're not gonna eat that, are you?

208
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,597
That speaks human language.

209
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,143
What's that?

210
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,602
The griffin!

211
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,062
What a shame. Can't believe what you've done.

212
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:31,649
(GRANPA'S LAST WORDS)

213
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,238
The man with weird armor,

214
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,615
it seems you're the teamleader.

215
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,535
What… are you doing?

216
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,456
Based on what you're wearing and how you talk,

217
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:49,750
I see, you must be a cadre of the demons.

218
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,610
(CADRES)

219
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,711
Exactly.

220
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,600
-I'm Heine of Fire, one of the four kings of the demons.
-What a terrific angle.

221
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,716
Since you can see how powerful I am,

222
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,094
you're not an ordinary human being.

223
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,639
Besides, you attacked our supply unit.

224
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,615
I really like that you have no chivalry at all.

225
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,519
It'll be a pity to kill you.

226
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,624
Leave those supplies and I'll let you go.

227
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,735
Alice, I think we'd better go back now.

228
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,945
That guy seems to be as extraordinarily strong

229
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:20,653
That's why you're only low level staff for this long

230
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,201
You're so honest and interesting. Want to join the demons?

231
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:29,457
It's okay if you want to be in charge of the human beings.

232
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,626
You can also have all the women you like.

233
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,836
I do.

234
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:34,836
Don't agree immediately!

235
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,258
Do you have do shame taking refuge in the enemy?

236
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,676
That's the food I'd like to eat.

237
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:45,099
Sorry. I've already had a horrible boss who enjoys strange role-play.

238
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,140
I think so.

239
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:51,263
I can see that you'd anything but will never betray your teammates.

240
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,731
Can I have your name?

241
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,734
Combat Agent Six.

242
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,068
Call me Six,

243
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,611
Heine of Fire, one of the four kings of the demons.

244
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:02,490
Six, right?

245
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,658
Take it, Six.

246
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,620
Let me show you the power of Heine of Fire, kings of the demons!

247
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:13,293
We have the advantage in terms of numbers.

248
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,961
Snow, Rosie, let's fight back!

249
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,711
No, I can't.

250
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,881
I can't restrain her with this Fire Strike.

251
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,884
Let me burn out the enemy's supplies.

252
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,302
And you go hinder her.

253
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,306
I also need to carry the supplies to another place.

254
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:27,932
Alice!

255
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,809
I'll support you.

256
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:30,893
Green!

257
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:34,062
What?

258
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,817
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

259
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,528
I will just scorch your whole body if anything goes wrong.

260
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,159
Amazing!

261
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,081
Excellent!

262
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:55,876
You guys… what if I actually betray you.

263
00:13:56,513 --> 00:13:57,296
Not again!

264
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:58,462
Six, lie down!

265
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:02,924
Alice!

266
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:08,474
This gun with bullets for large animals also recoils strongly.

267
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,892
Is that brat… a human being?

268
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,298
Feels somewhat like magic.

269
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:13,894
And her weapon…

270
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,605
Who the hell are you?

271
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,279
Two overwhelming…

272
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:25,990
It's too tough.

273
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,453
Good…good morning?

274
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,715
Green?

275
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,511
How long are you gonna play with these little brats for?

276
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:48,386
I'm not playing, OK?

277
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,058
Fine. I've lost my interests.

278
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,148
Six, come on!

279
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,774
Let me fight against that guy.

280
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:03,027
At the same time, Six, go pick Green up.

281
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:06,239
How dare you, a human being, to fight against me?

282
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:11,410
I'm Lord Gadalkand of Earth, one of the four kings of the demons.

283
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,870
Remember?

284
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,749
Now, die like a bug.

285
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,041
You're the one who should go to hell.

286
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:25,019
Rosie, good job.

287
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,095
How dare you lood down upon me?

288
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,303
Let's fight together.

289
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,179
Yes.

290
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,020
Six, she has been dead

291
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,523
for a long time.

292
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:43,679
Even though I only know that her pants were with laces,

293
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:48,312
I will definitely kill that bastard.

294
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,658
Alice, send me my R Saw.

295
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,743
I'm gonna saw him to pieces.

296
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,750
Snow, cover me.

297
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,210
Rosie, take care of Green.

298
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:02,587
Yes, Teamleader.

299
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,547
Why are you so excited?

300
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:07,091
You should live your lives more happily.

301
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,927
Lord Gadalkand, please go back.

302
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:15,517
If you're not on the battlefield, Lord Russell of Water will blame our clan.

303
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,687
You get your lives back, human beings.

304
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,148
What a joke. You're not escaping, are you?

305
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:22,063
See you next time.

306
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,149
Wait. Get down!

307
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,192
Damn!

308
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,543
Alice, where's my R Saw?

309
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:32,115
At the moment that guy flew, I stopped its delivery.

310
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:34,368
I see.

311
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,038
Let's say the last goodbye to Green.

312
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:40,666
That bastard and his mace will soon show up on the battlefield anyway.

313
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:44,419
Six, Green won't die from a small accident like this.

314
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:50,091
As you see, Rosie has the bloodline of monsters.

315
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,929
People detest her just because of this.

316
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,931
No matter where she goes, they treat her harshly,

317
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,142
like asking her attack the enemy alone.

318
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,522
That's why her fighting count is so high.

319
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:08,001
It seems there are many bastards in this country,
making me feel myself righteous and kind.

320
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:12,823
Yes, this country is inundated with bastards who are equal to you.

321
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:16,451
And Green was almost treated like that.

322
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:21,018
She is Archbishop of Zenaris. Only a few people know that.

323
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,791
She will come back to life no matter how many times he dies.

324
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:30,092
It seems we lost badly.

325
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:34,096
Then, we can show the senior that we sacrificed a lot.

326
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,305
Miss Snow.

327
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:38,432
I know. Anyway we'll go to the temple first.

328
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:44,646
Are we gonna bring Green back to life in a place like this?

329
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,273
Yes.

330
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:49,461
We just need to put her body and the oblation on the altar.

331
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,948
Then when the night comes, she'll come back to life by herself.

332
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:55,575
Are this broken stuff the oblation?

333
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:57,827
The oblation given to the evil lord Zenaris

334
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,663
must be something from people's precious thought and insistence.

335
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:02,748
It should be enough with so many things.

336
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,334
I need to go back to my room.

337
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,006
I'm gonna spend some time maintaining this stuff.

338
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:10,423
What about you, Six?

339
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,093
I just want to stay here like this.

340
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,365
Teamleader?

341
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,994
What are you doing here?

342
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:42,748
Waiting for your rebirth.

343
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:43,955
Why?

344
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:49,478
Am I getting punished for dying without showing my power in the battle?

345
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,713
No.

346
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,715
If there's no one here when you come back to life,

347
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:54,799
I think you'd feel very lonely.

348
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,636
You're so strange.

349
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,479
No one has been so considerate to me before.

350
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:04,838
People usually think that I'm disgusting.

351
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,107
I think it's the first time I'm praised as a human after in this country.

352
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,026
Yes, I'm praising you.

353
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:15,653
Teamleader, if you don't mind,

354
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:17,615
would you to go on a date?

355
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:23,497
Teamleader, this wheelchair is so amazing!

356
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,124
I can't go back after feeling this.

357
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,875
It's a product of Kisaragi Corporation after all.

358
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,796
Green, now you're the fastest in this country.

359
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,963
I'm different from Rosie and anyone else, right?

360
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,258
So I was regarded as trouble in the army.

361
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,551
I was always sent to dangerous battlefields.

362
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,387
We don't die easily, so that's OK.

363
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:45,184
But Teamleader, you'd better resign from the army and leave this country.

364
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:47,353
Why did you say so?

365
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:51,423
In my troop, all members except me are women. It's a troop of harems.

366
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,608
I will never resign even if someone begs me to do so.

367
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:58,279
Then from now on, please take care of me, teamleader.

368
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,407
I'm sorry for having you worry about me.

369
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,535
It doesn't matter, now that you're back.

370
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,247
Villainy points increased.

371
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,667
One more couple in front.

372
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,170
Villainy points increased.

373
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,087
You two!

374
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,756
Stop!

375
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,469
You have to work so late under orders.

376
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,306
You probably hate these couples, too.

377
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,015
No, I also have a boyfriend…

378
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,436
How abou you?

379
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:31,444
Is it becuase you can't get a boyfriend that you vent like this?

380
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,900
Damn, how dare you say that?

381
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,233
The great Lord Zenaris, please bring disasters to this woman.

382
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:38,863
I curse your sudden dizziness.

383
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:41,365
Your power is…

384
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:46,579
Teamleader, I can't guarantee the power of curse will always work.

385
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,250
The success rate of my curse is about 80%.

386
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:56,381
Besides, to make the curse work, it needs relevant oblation.

387
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:59,550
If I fail, the curse will take effect on myself.

388
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,594
As you see, like this…

389
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,471
I see.

390
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:08,045
You must have cursed on one's feet, and the curse took effect on you.

391
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:09,809
No.

392
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:13,021
It was the curse of being unable to wear shoes.

393
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,983
You power sounds like nonsense.

394
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,402
You say it nonsense?

395
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:20,529
Then let me show you the real curse.

396
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,531
The great Lord Zenaris,

397
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,826
please bring disasters to this woman who has a boyfriend.

398
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,369
Let her suffer the severe foot pain of kicking the wardrobe.

399
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:32,666
It hurts!

400
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,460
Hey, it's dangerous to move around like this…

401
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:41,711
Eh… So I have to take her back to that temple.

402
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:13,044
(THE LOUNGE MEETING IN PROGESS)

403
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,561
Six sent us a report.

404
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:16,980
(NEXT EPISODE)
They arrived safely.

405
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,097
(NEXT EPISODE)
Terrific.

406
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,816
What did he say?

407
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:20,733
Let me see.

408
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,567
(Next Episode The Right Way to Conquer The High Tower)
They found a civilization circle

409
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,528
(Next Episode The Right Way to Conquer The High Tower)
and were recruited by a local organization.

410
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,489
(STAY TUNED)
They've also started to collect information…

411
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,906
That's great.

412
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:31,368
And have a bad-tempered pretty subordinate with big breast…

413
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,368
What?

414
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:36,277
There seems to be a beauty and strong enemy with big breast and brown skin.

415
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:39,460
Seems like a strong enemy.
