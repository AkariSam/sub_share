1
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,990
Perhaps hell

2
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,909
would be better than here.

3
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:40,680
(Episode 10 A Fleeting Midsummer Night's Dream)

4
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,759
What should we do? Rush them?

5
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,849
If it were just us two it would be okay,

6
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,840
but carrying fragile goods and dead weight, we don't have a chance.

7
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,530
Aren't you the ones who followed me?

8
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,900
Don't be cocky, brat.

9
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,319
I'm not a child.

10
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,680
Only children ever say that.

11
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,430
Let's do our best together.

12
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,610
Everyone is hungry and waiting for us.

13
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,750
It's no good, we've attracted their attention.

14
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:21,159
I'll distract them while you two escape back to Tenmaya.

15
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,620
Vampires, you have two roads before you...

16
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,030
Will he be alright?

17
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,870
Kurusu has his own way of dealing with things alone.

18
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,199
Keep up, don't get lost.

19
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,750
I told you, I'm not a child.

20
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,650
How ugly.

21
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,550
Here you are. Where did you go?

22
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,849
Nowhere, just walked around.

23
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,919
How many times have I told you, it's dangerous to go out at night?

24
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,740
I'm back safe, it's fine.

25
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,090
What is it?

26
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,449
There's something only you can help with.

27
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,050
Can I refuse?

28
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,360
This.

29
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,089
That's Misaki's...

30
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,680
This costume miraculously escaped the fire.

31
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,970
I want Eurydice to wear this.

32
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,009
You're performing "L'Orfeo"? Where?

33
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,579
Here, we'll have an opera here.

34
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,769
I can already picture how you play the harp.

35
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,389
I'm performing in "L'Orfeo"? No one told me that.

36
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,240
I just decided.

37
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,470
Don't make that face.

38
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,509
I want to raise everyone's spirits.

39
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,620
People are still scared,

40
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:09,199
and a lot of people are still homeless, so...

41
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,939
I understand.

42
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:14,720
"L'Orfeo", although it's not the most interesting opera,

43
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,800
if you can change the fate of Eurydice,

44
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:19,449
maybe I'll consider.

45
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,980
You'll do it?

46
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,000
I have dreams, too.

47
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,290
If I get on stage, they can be realised.

48
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,560
This is easy to understand.

49
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,189
Every member's life experiences, families,

50
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,389
even social circles have been noted here.

51
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:45,899
Do you still need information on Code Zero's vampires?

52
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,550
It's not comfortable walking with a pebble in your shoe.

53
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,970
You must be strong, to call them a pebble.

54
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,540
After all, we have the King Kong Troop you created.

55
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,529
But those higher-ups don't know their worth.

56
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,529
Such a nuisance.

57
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,730
With such wrong policy, our country's future is in darkness.

58
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,639
Isn't it you and your King Kong Troop who will cut through that darkness?

59
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,850
Let me take care of the pebble.

60
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,529
I'm looking forward to it.

61
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:24,100
Now that Maeda is dead, only you can command the King Kong Troop.

62
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
Thank you.

63
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,319
I will do my best not to disappoint.

64
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,790
It's lucky that it survived the fire.

65
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,259
The costumes seem to have been hidden away in a hamper.

66
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,660
With this, Eurydice will be perfect.

67
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,670
That's great. Clothes make the man.

68
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:48,100
Not me. I want to see Deffrot perform.

69
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,439
But if we don't get the costumes together,

70
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,189
shepherds and the hell gaolers...

71
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,769
What else? And why do you need to advertise in the newspaper?

72
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,769
What's wrong with contributing to society?

73
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,819
If you contribute to the society, you will get recognition.

74
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,620
After I saw the opera Nito Shinbun recommended,

75
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,870
my strength returned to me.

76
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,259
I should subscribe to their newspaper.

77
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,910
Sales doubled!

78
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,730
What's your wishful thinking?

79
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,519
If only that were true.

80
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,990
In a world like this, I'll do my best.

81
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,670
Thank you, Chief!

82
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,129
I really want to see Miss Misaki's "Salome" again.

83
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,230
Pull me up.

84
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,920
Kurusu, please pull the rope up.

85
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,939
Got it.

86
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:02,449
I can't believe you'd send a vampire to find something underwater.

87
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,500
Excellent, the box is unscathed.

88
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,819
All right, let's get it to Tenmaya.

89
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,110
I want to see what's inside, too.

90
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,589
This is the last one.

91
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,110
All right, it's open.

92
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:19,680
Is it okay to open it?

93
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,269
That's why we brought it.

94
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,089
Wait.

95
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,110
All right.

96
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,439
I'm opening it!

97
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,509
It seems to be fine.

98
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,799
What is it?

99
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,909
Stink bomb prototype.

100
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,820
Stop. Don't shake that.

101
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:42,870
Why?

102
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,620
Stay away. Stop playing around.

103
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:50,220
What about this one?

104
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,990
Designs for a flying machine.

105
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
Want to fly?

106
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,759
Is that possible?

107
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,399
For A-class Kurusu, maybe.

108
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,159
And I've more or less collected all the materials.

109
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,950
Do you want to have a try?

110
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,490
That would be interesting!

111
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:10,820
So they're just toys.

112
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,370
The most important stuff is in here.

113
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,000
The source blood for the King Kong Troop.

114
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,659
That's...

115
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,070
It hasn't gone off?

116
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,980
Incredibly, it doesn't rot or coagulate.

117
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,070
It remains permanently in its original state.

118
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,240
But the second sunlight touches it, it will explode.

119
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,269
I've paid the price with my eye, after all.

120
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,149
What did you retrieve this for?

121
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,190
To understand exactly what vampires are.

122
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,470
Only sunlight affects this blood.

123
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,850
I think it's ultraviolet light that's responsible.

124
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,120
Since ultraviolet light can kill vampires,

125
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,370
if used carefully, perhaps it can make them age too.

126
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,980
We can grow up too?

127
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:07,590
Although you also might die.

128
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,600
Maybe that's okay too.

129
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,690
When will it be ready? Tomorrow?

130
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,799
Not so fast.

131
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,129
But you won't have to wait too long.

132
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,340
200 years. No, 100 years is definitely enough.

133
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:28,629
After all, only time is infinite.

134
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,080
Is here OK?

135
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,100
Thank you, Santaro.

136
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,649
I'll take it from here.

137
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,909
But why do you need so much bamboo?

138
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,779
I was commissioned by a craftsman.

139
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,570
He said he wanted to make a big kite.

140
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,059
Interesting.

141
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,740
This much bamboo,

142
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,179
could make a kite to scare Goemon Ishikawa himself.

143
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,639
The craftsman will be pleased.

144
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,750
If only this world could fly as high as a kite.

145
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,750
I hope this vampire business will blow over before the new year.

146
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
It should be fine, I think it will be a good year.

147
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,000
If Tenmaya says so, then I'm sure it will.

148
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,009
Pleasure doing business with you.

149
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,309
Thank you.

150
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,590
What are you doing?

151
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,730
I just wanted to look at it.

152
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,879
You want to grow up?

153
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,830
I want to become human.

154
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:36,960
You can only dream of that.

155
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,690
Do we still have dreams?

156
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,629
Even I haven't tried.

157
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,889
Like butterflies, like flowers...

158
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,600
What?

159
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,990
Suwa, can you come here?

160
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,899
I know it's sudden, but I want you to deliver something tonight.

161
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,289
Alright, I'll go now.

162
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,509
If all the good in the world is dead, even hell is nothing to fear.

163
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,480
Excellent, a worthy performance.

164
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,970
What are you doing here?

165
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:34,269
What's her name? Aoi Shirase asked me to come

166
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,250
as her guest.

167
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,460
Then, can I ask you to leave now?

168
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,950
I don't want to have any more connections with you.

169
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,179
I just came to say hello. I also have no interest in seeing you.

170
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,850
But a self-important vampire like you can't be ignored.

171
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,139
Enjoy your journey to hell.

172
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,179
Orpheus, sir, it's time.

173
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,799
Where did he go?

174
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:14,690
Lights, ready, background, ready.

175
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,879
Next comes the actors...

176
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,350
It's so bright.

177
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,179
I think there's an opera playing overnight at the Imperial Hotel.

178
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,610
Tenmaya said.

179
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,350
What?

180
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:40,769
Hey, we still have work to do.

181
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,539
It'll just take a second.

182
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,919
Takeuchi told me to keep a close eye on you.

183
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:47,850
Alright, let's go.

184
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,240
Whatever, when things are better I can go anytime.

185
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,240
Let's do this quickly.

186
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,929
Alright.

187
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,039
Aoi must be there to see the opera too.

188
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:15,690
Eurydice.

189
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:20,970
You are the sweet wine of life, the eternal light in a sea of misery.

190
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,980
The flame of my life.

191
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,379
All of my love.

192
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,840
And your doubting heart

193
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:29,950
has destroyed it all.

194
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,450
That sweetness, light, even the flame of my life

195
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,169
are mere candles in the wind,

196
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,879
But benevolent god of love.

197
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:50,659
if you have any sympathy for our love,

198
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,659
please carry our ashes to the sky,

199
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,610
where they may become a star.

200
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,799
Let all the lovers looking up at the sky

201
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,740
learn from our mistake.

202
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,009
Being on stage feels as good as I hoped.

203
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,120
If only just for a moment, I could feel the taste of death.

204
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,679
A thistle.

205
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,000
Rufus, what are you thinking?

206
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,210
We're back.

207
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:44,789
Welcome home.

208
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,960
How did it go?

209
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,519
As you'd expect.

210
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,000
Suwa didn't go to the opera.

211
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:53,340
Shut up.

212
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,559
Any gift?

213
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:00,759
A mask? Amazing!

214
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,639
Don't be so clingy.

215
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,370
A gift!

216
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,899
Throw it away.

217
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,629
Good work, it seems the information was correct.

218
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,870
Yes, so we can all move as a group.

219
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,950
Yes, we just need to prepare the transportation.

220
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,519
It's underway.

221
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:23,250
I put the bamboo you wanted inside.

222
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,090
Thank you, then we should be able to do a test-drive.

223
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,820
What do you want to test?

224
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,970
Wait and see.

225
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:46,179
It's me, Deffrot, with your invitation.

226
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,279
That voice.

227
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,309
"I am the daughter of Herodias, the princess of Judea."

228
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,319
"Let me hear that voice one more time, John."

229
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,670
What are you plotting, Rufus?

230
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,890
There's something I want to discuss.

231
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,630
Where is that girl?

232
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,079
Here.

233
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,740
If you want to catch a big fish, you have to prepare the right bait.

234
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,940
You thought I would be interested in a human?

235
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,339
You look up to her like an older sister. That should be enough.

236
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:03,089
Shut your mouth.

237
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,720
It's you who should be quiet.

238
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,480
The sun brings death to us all.

239
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:30,019
I will make you die by other means.

240
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,200
No need.

241
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,650
You're already turning to ashes.

242
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,059
Rufus, have you no self-respect?

243
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,200
Self-respect?

244
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,470
I lost that when I lost my humanity.

245
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,410
Do you know what I hate most in this world?

246
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,750
Self-important vampires.

247
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,700
Deffrot, are you alright? Are you hurt?

248
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:10,000
Stay back.

249
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,700
But, you...

250
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,849
Don't treat me like a child.

251
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,680
Where did your self-respect go?

252
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,200
I can't watch this third-rate acting.

253
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,480
Turn to ashes and drop the curtain.

254
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,880
An unexpected performer has entered the stage.

255
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,509
Should I tie it here?

256
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:49,759
Yes, please.

257
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,160
It's already taking shape.

258
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,279
A huge kite.

259
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,180
What is it?

260
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,779
A flying machine.

261
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,599
Flying? Will it fly?

262
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,730
Yes, I heard that in Europe they're already using planes

263
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,599
to drop bombs and gain a tactical advantage.

264
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:11,960
I believe that in the future,

265
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,710
he who controls the sky, controls the world.

266
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,240
Even so, what use is a flying vampire?

267
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:22,440
If you can fly, you bypass all land barriers.

268
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,210
You can move faster and further.

269
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,400
I want to fly!

270
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,829
Suwa, have a go too.

271
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,470
A thing made from cloth tied to bamboo,

272
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,529
it's just a kite. Who would fly on that?

273
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,640
If anything, it's more like a bat.

274
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,490
Isn't it dangerous?

275
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,750
According to my calculations, each wing needs to be 20 meters long.

276
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,150
If we used iron, it would break.

277
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,460
But by using this light and strong bamboo,

278
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:59,730
it should hold together.

279
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,720
And the person who uses it must be strong.

280
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,319
Thirty times stronger than an average human.

281
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,690
Then humans have no chance.

282
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,039
Yes, it needs to be a vampire.

283
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:12,920
Right, Kurusu?

284
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,900
What? Me?

285
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,650
There's no way humans can fly.

286
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,099
We want to try, right Yo?

287
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,660
Yes, I want to fly with the birds!

288
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,579
Birds don't fly in the dark,

289
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,009
they fly under the sun, when we can't go out.

290
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,240
If the sun touches us, we ignite and die.

291
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,660
Misaki.

292
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,269
Eradicate

293
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,049
the vampires.

294
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:40,019
(THE BLACK WING)
