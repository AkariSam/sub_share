00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:38,055
Episode 7 Letters

00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,335
"Let me hear that voice one more time, John"

4
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,421
(ONE YEAR AGO, WINTER, TOKYO STATION)

5
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,195
It looks like the clouds.

6
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,367
Hey, excuse me.

7
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:40,360
What's up?

8
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,413
Do you know where the Imperial Theater is?

9
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,876
Is it really OK for you to live in the attic?

10
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,128
After all, you're introduced by Mr. Okimura.

11
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:54,091
I asked for it myself.

12
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,092
It's OK for me to live here.

13
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:23,662
From now on, here is my home.

14
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,659
Here is my place.

15
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,689
Mr. Mouse?

16
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,628
Not that way.

17
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,340
Monster?

18
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,467
Get out now.

19
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,551
Ah!

20
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,263
Where did you come in?

21
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,300
I won't tell others. Just go.

22
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,812
Have you listened to me?

23
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,524
Oh no, how thin you are! Do you eat well?

24
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,276
Are you hungry?

25
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,901
You're so annoying.

26
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,655
The light is blinding. Can you take it away?

27
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,782
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,950
But I'm very worried about you.

29
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,286
Humph.

30
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,495
Ah?

31
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,290
Stop asking too much about my business.

32
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,542
Where are you going?

33
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,629
It's time.

34
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,837
Time?

35
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,802
"It was a long long time ago.

36
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,555
Me, Deffrot is playing the devil

37
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,055
who had been lurking in a forest

38
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,185
in Russia long before.

39
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:32,105
Towards it, a tired soldier back from the battlefield…"

40
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,567
Good job, Deffrot.

41
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,860
Excuse me. He is?

42
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:40,071
He used to be an actor in Britain

43
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,365
and had the recommendation from the British ambassador.

44
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,744
I didn't know he's so great.

45
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,471
Welcome back, Deffrot.

46
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,473
You're still here.

47
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,226
I've heard from the manager,

48
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,019
something about you.

49
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,600
You're so excellent!

50
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,567
Surprisingly, you've been an actor since you were a little kid.

51
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,540
Hey, what are you doing?

52
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,793
I'm Misaki Nakajima.

53
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,211
Nice to meet you.

54
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,966
Can you leave me alone?

55
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,339
But, I'm also an actress here.

56
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,470
And we may act together on the stage.

57
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,223
Even so, we don't have to be friends.

58
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,160
Your hat is askew.

59
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,153
Sure enough the military uniform is not suitable for me.

60
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,240
Didn't you say yourself that want to be a soldier?

61
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,576
Even so…

62
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,829
Actually it doesn't matter if you keep staying at my home.

63
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,279
How can I do that?

64
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,543
Since I lost my cloth shop,

65
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,920
I've lived at your home, bothering you.

66
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,673
I can't trouble you and your family anymore.

67
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,550
My family don't mind,

68
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,093
neither does Mother.

69
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,096
Since my brother Sentaro died,

70
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,225
she's been taking care of you as if you were her own child, hasn't she?

71
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,269
But, I'm not a child anymore.

72
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,937
I must be independent.

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,607
Besides…

74
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,735
Are you so unwilling to be seen as my fiancé?

75
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,194
I didn't mean that.

76
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,404
You care too much about the gossip.

77
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,197
I really didn't mean that.

78
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:49,910
Then what did you mean? Tell me clearly.

79
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,911
Aoi, you are so strong.

80
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,872
What do you mean?

81
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,791
You were strong when Sentaro died.

82
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,252
You shed no tears in front of us,

83
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,464
while I just couldn't stop crying.

84
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:07,636
That's why I want to be strong.

85
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:12,182
It hurts.

86
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,516
Promise me.

87
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,391
Eh?

88
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,353
Promise me that you, Shutaro, will not die.

89
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,903
OK, I promise.

90
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,615
That's good.

91
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,742
Go to places like Siberia or something soon.

92
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,077
Then come back.

93
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:33,786
Yes!

94
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,918
YOSHINOBU MAEDA

95
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,259
God bless it can get there.

96
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,305
Everyone, good work.

97
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:56,976
Here you are.

98
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,060
What?

99
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,814
Siberian cake. You'll get sick if you don't eat well.

100
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,651
I don't need it.

101
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,737
How can something like that be to my taste?

102
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,509
Come on. Eat it.

103
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,244
I'll eat it later.

104
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,245
Remember to eat it up.

105
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,624
Is that by Shakespeare?

106
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,250
"Romeo and Juliet".

107
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,254
Are you going to play Romeo?

108
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,009
Yes. But it seems we haven't found the right person to play Juliet.

109
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,679
Without Juliet, it has to be my monodrama.

110
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,432
I see.

111
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,600
And you? You want the role of Salome, right?

112
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:39,719
Yes.

113
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,566
"How good it is to see the moon.

114
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,735
She is like a little piece of money.

115
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,029
You would think she was a little silver flower.

116
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,323
The moon is cold and chaste.

117
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,995
I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty."

118
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,663
"The Lord is coming soon.

119
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,582
So is that one's son."

120
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:04,836
What's wrong?

121
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,129
Why have you remembered all the lines?

122
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,549
Because I'm an actor who is accommodated here.

123
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,385
In case of emergencies, I have to cover for other actors.

124
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:15,759
Speaking of which,

125
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,110
your acting of Salome is terrible.

126
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,644
How dare you tell me what to do when your acting is so bad?

127
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,419
The role I play is a princess.

128
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,650
A real princess will never be pretentious like that.

129
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,195
You can't act like a princess.

130
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,404
A princess is what she is.

131
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,700
It sounds as if you'd seen a real princess.

132
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:38,702
Sure I have.

133
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,998
Really? How awesome!

134
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,293
Can you stop treating me like a child?

135
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,254
I've been an actor longer than you.

136
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:51,633
Got it, Mr. Deffrot.

137
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,884
No mister.

138
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,596
How can I be the true Salome?

139
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,523
"How good it is to see the moon.

140
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,110
She is like a little piece of money.

141
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,409
You would think she was a little silver flower.

142
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,323
The moon is cold and chaste.

143
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,994
I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty."

144
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,206
How amazing and lifelike.

145
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,000
Your interpretation

146
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,671
shouldn't focus on acting like Princess Salome.

147
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,423
You play knowing the ending of the story,

148
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,967
so it looks very stagy.

149
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,970
Your Salome doesn't know

150
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,149
that this love is cursed and soaked in blood.

151
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,686
You believe this love is pure.

152
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,563
Come on, one more time.

153
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,825
"How good it is to see the moon.

154
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,787
She is like a little piece of money.

155
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,874
You would think she was a little silver flower.

156
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,626
The moon is cold and chaste.

157
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,673
I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty."

158
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,445
Misaki.

159
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,572
Uncle Okimura.

160
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,076
I heard you're going to be the lead on stage this time.

161
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,870
Yes, and I'm playing Salome.

162
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,875
Oh? Is it the play by Oscar Wilde?

163
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,543
So, you knew about that.

164
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,909
Will Nakajima come and watch the show?

165
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,633
Father is busy with official business.

166
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,676
How can he not come to see?

167
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,057
The tie between Japan and Britain is improved by cultural communication.

168
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,308
We can't neglect it.

169
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,520
Fine. Let me teach him the importance of it.

170
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,273
I'd really appreciate it.

171
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,734
Thanks to your strong support,

172
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,693
I could join the Imperial Theater.

173
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,739
It was nothing. Never mind.

174
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,950
You father and I are old friends.

175
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:25,327
Then, I'm looking forward to your performance.

176
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,371
Thank you so much.

177
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,919
Deffrot, do you want some Siberian cake?

178
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,799
Are you deliberately driving me mad?

179
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:41,427
Just a joke.

180
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,514
Where have you been?

181
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,515
My home.

182
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:47,642
Eh?

183
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,937
So your home's where you can leave for in the morning and return now?

184
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,272
Yes.

185
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,982
It's in Hikawacho in Akasaka.

186
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,639
Why don't you live at home?

187
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,072
That place is scary.

188
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,826
Are all your family there?

189
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,899
My father lives there.

190
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,125
He's always busy with work and seldom comes home.

191
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,419
He only comes home to get changed

192
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,296
or take the letters which are sent home.

193
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,674
Now, here is my home.

194
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,467
Eh?

195
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,429
Are these the letters you just mentioned?

196
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,597
These are

197
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,350
letters from Mr. Maeda.

198
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,312
He's Father's old acquaintance.

199
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,730
What is he like?

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,606
He's my fiancé.

201
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,068
But we haven't met each other.

202
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,028
Oh?

203
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,697
We just write letters.

204
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,115
However,

205
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,368
though he always writes the letters in a flat tone,

206
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,870
there are always humorous words.

207
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,663
And he's also very considerate.

208
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,499
He put a pressed flower in the letter before.

209
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,543
Don't look for it. I don't want to read other people's letter.

210
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,629
Got it. See? It's a four-leave clover.

211
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,842
Things like that are just weeds.

212
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,136
It doesn't matter. It's so lovely.

213
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,475
How strange it is to marry a man who you've never seen.

214
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:12,809
You're absolutely in the 16th Century.

215
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,729
Am I?

216
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,980
It's quite common in Japan.

217
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,106
(TO MISAKI NAKAJIMA)

218
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:19,775
By reading these letters,

219
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,860
even we haven't met each other,

220
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,030
I can see that he's very gentle and kind,

221
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,033
but also very shy.

222
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,910
It's almost like "Cyrano de Bergerac".

223
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,703
What's that?

224
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,999
It's a story that two people fall in love only through letters.

225
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,585
And the ending is?

226
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,298
A tragedy.

227
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,850
Are things like this acceptable to fashionable women in the world?

228
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,436
Besides, the theme is too classical.

229
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,688
It isn't innovative at all.

230
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,567
If it were not for the report, I wouldn't come.

231
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,993
Is this the lead actress's first play on stage?

232
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:13,037
What will her acting be like?

233
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,206
Can I stay awake till the end of the show?

234
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,258
Trust me! "Salome" this time was awesome!

235
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,884
First, the lead Misaki was the best.

236
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,179
She acted like she was Princess Salome herself.

237
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,764
It was a new interpretation, but her performance was impeccable.

238
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:36,269
The acting, lighting, music and stage design were all the best.

239
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:39,062
How many things were the best do you think?

240
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,940
In a word, it was the best.

241
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,860
Let me write the report for the following "Romeo and Juliet".

242
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,821
Miss Misaki, the actress who plays Salome will play Juliet.

243
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,532
I believe the interpretation of Romeo will be excellent, too.

244
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,741
Because it is played by a blond boy.

245
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,369
A boy with blond hair!

246
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,456
I don't have many connections in the Imperial Theater.

247
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:00,250
But that's a play fashionable women want to watch.

248
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,809
Welcome back.

249
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,870
You're here.

250
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:16,017
Yes.

251
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,812
Because I'll be busier in the Imperial Theater,

252
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,981
I want to clean up the house first.

253
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,159
You had your hair cut.

254
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,149
It's my determination.

255
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,663
Is it suitable for me?

256
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:40,832
Yes.

257
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,376
I've heard from Okimura.

258
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:45,909
Congratulations on being the lead.

259
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,250
Thank you.

260
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,221
By the way, Maeda

261
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,889
has already come back.

262
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,725
Mr. Maeda is back?

263
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,726
Has he recovered from his injury?

264
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,980
It is said that he has almost recovered.

265
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,943
He is back.

266
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,849
A letter

267
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,036
to Mr. Maeda.

268
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,579
It's the season when sunflowers

269
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,250
are blooming toward the sun again.

270
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,711
How are you doing recently?

271
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,644
I remember I've told you that you're not allowed here.

272
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,189
I brought you blood of S class from Yokohama.

273
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,902
Oh? It's quite expected.

274
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,660
It still lacks necessary adjustment,

275
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:57,034
but we had it prepared since we need it to trade with Mr. Okimura.

276
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,997
This even cost us some sacrafice.

277
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,876
That's because we are walking through the dark at night.

278
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:12,383
Father.

279
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,847
How careless you are.

280
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,339
Misaki,

281
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,170
anything wrong?

282
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,156
Why do you look like being possessed by a devil?

283
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,992
A devil?

284
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,078
Maybe.

285
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,165
Deffrot.

286
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,416
Yes?

287
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,337
Do you think there are vampires in the world?

288
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,634
Why do you ask such a question?

289
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:00,640
My father, he… No, nothing.

290
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,809
I'll go practice on the stage.

291
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,788
"How good it is to see the moon.

292
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,541
She is like a little piece of money.

293
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,461
You would think she was a little silver flower.

294
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,964
The moon is cold and chaste.

295
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,803
I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty.

296
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,305
Voices and voices.

297
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:42,807
Words and words.

298
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,266
Tongue and tongue.

299
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,729
The desire to kiss that man's mouth with mine.

300
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,026
Come, bring the prophet here!"

301
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,032
Salome!

302
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,992
Salome was crushed by it!

303
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:05,246
Hurry, send for the doctor!

304
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,086
Misaki.

305
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,007
I m…must apologize.

306
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,556
My Salome,

307
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:27,393
I wanted to play it for Mr. Maeda.

308
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,316
I'm sure you can do it.

309
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,569
Therefore…

310
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,596
Send to Tsukishima.

311
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,105
"Let me hear that voice one more time,

312
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,902
John."

313
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,118
Aren't you going to keep

314
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,746
the promise you made to Miss Misaki?

315
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,251
Things you've done should be ended by yourselves.

316
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,005
Wake up, human.

317
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:45,386
You've ruined our reputation. How can you quit the show like this?

318
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,056
Play it till the last minute!

319
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,960
The Purgatory
