Episode 11 The Black Wing

2
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,700
Mr. Maeda?

3
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,829
Look who it is, Lt. Colonel Maeda.

4
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,489
You're not dead after all. This is presumptuous of me.

5
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:03,530
I am the new commander of Special Forces Unit 16, Rufus Glenn.

6
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:06,629
Now then...

7
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,289
Enjoy.

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,319
Misaki...

9
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:22,830
I must eliminate the vampires.

10
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,129
Mr. Maeda!

11
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,370
Deffrot!

12
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,050
This isn't...

13
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:35,699
your cue!

14
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,319
Watch out!

15
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,370
Deffrot!

16
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:43,939
Stay away!

17
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:53,539
Huh...

18
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,449
Both me... and him... are vampires.

19
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,289
W-why?

20
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,060
What have you done

21
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,180
to this child?

22
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,650
Misaki...

23
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:10,900
Hey!

24
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,319
Hold on!

25
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,870
Morning.

26
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,399
Good morning.

27
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,769
Is the kite ready yet?

28
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,569
How impatient.

29
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,430
We are Edo men, after all.

30
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,040
It's not an extra serving of noodles.

31
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,170
No one can make it that fast.

32
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,540
Be sure to give me a look once it's done.

33
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:35,949
Soon.

34
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,290
Alright!

35
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm off then.

36
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,660
He's a curious guy.

37
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,930
You're pushing too hard.

38
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,350
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,689
Tenmaya, sir, welcome back.

40
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,670
Ah.

41
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,689
Mr. Tenmaya?

42
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,930
Don't worry, it's just a scratch.

43
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,509
It hasn't healed at all.

44
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:03,410
That's because I'm human.

45
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:06,899
Why would a human help vampires?

46
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,750
Because I was saved by a vampire before.

47
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,329
I'll put medicine on.

48
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,300
The young master is half-Japanese.

49
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,920
Huh?

50
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,089
He was always bullied and discriminated

51
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:25,129
against by other humans.

52
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,470
Only a few of us would play with him.

53
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,430
TENMAYA

54
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,509
Let's go!

55
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,480
Master, where are you going?

56
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,040
To watch the Sumidagawa fireworks.

57
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,970
Watch out for him.

58
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,129
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,790
Master.

60
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,610
I'll keep my headscarf on.

61
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,740
How is it, Shinbou?

62
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,399
Shinbou?

63
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,620
It's so dark now, it's fine.

64
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:41,819
Where did he go?

65
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,990
Come out, freak!

66
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,899
Shinbou?

67
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,259
That was the young master's voice,

68
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,410
over at the shrine.

69
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,170
Shinbou!

70
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,029
You can't!

71
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,829
It's only because the old master took me in,

72
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,149
that I'm still alive now.

73
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,579
It's time to repay him!

74
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:23,060
Shinbou,

75
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,170
stay safe, okay?

76
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,069
I see.

77
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,199
He's an eccentric who likes vampires and hates humans.

78
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,430
I wonder when he'll be cured of it?

79
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,550
You actually can do things other than killing people?

80
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,269
I can survive in human society, this skill is essential.

81
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,740
Being able to live as long as we do, we get to see plenty of things.

82
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,970
I want to see more new things.

83
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,800
You're a vampire, why are you so happy?

84
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,129
Maybe I should be asking you, aren't you still human?

85
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:14,800
It's about your state of mind.

86
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:17,100
That little guy is the same.

87
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,139
Kurusu also retains some of his humanity.

88
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,939
Humans and vampires... what's the difference?

89
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,200
The difference is if you've lived long enough.

90
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,539
Animals,

91
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,070
eat and sleep, have children and die.

92
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,259
They can only choose this way to live.

93
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,649
But humans have invented so many kinds of entertainment.

94
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,690
Singing, dancing, plays

95
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,690
and movies.

96
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,429
Imagine all the things there will be to see in the future.

97
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Interesting, right?

98
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:01,529
Yeah.

99
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,690
I just need to tell you, right?

100
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,879
I understand.

101
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,379
Have a cup of wake-me-up tea.

102
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,909
Do you like your milk added before or after?

103
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,250
It will finally be my time to shine.

104
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,409
The next time you make a racket, I'll kill you.

105
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,110
This is no good.

106
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,059
It's time for the play to begin.

107
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,139
I...

108
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,720
It's better not to move.

109
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,669
Although I stopped your bleeding for now,

110
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,500
you already lost a lot of blood.

111
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,100
I never knew

112
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,610
that you were a vampire.

113
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,250
Even if I told you, you wouldn't have believed me.

114
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,370
It's not easy for vampires to live in this world.

115
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,539
We can't walk under the sun.

116
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,860
Our bodies do not age.

117
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,860
We live in fear of exposing our identities.

118
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,679
But we have to find our own way to survive.

119
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:57,929
In the end,

120
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,940
our souls cannot cling to this eternal body.

121
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
So the older vampires become,

122
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,110
the more depressed they are.

123
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,460
Or they stop moving and live in the dark,

124
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,159
staying in the same place for hundreds of years.

125
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,279
Surviving in this world is really tiring.

126
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:24,825
On the stage, playing all kinds of people,

127
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,669
I've played out the end of many fictional lives.

128
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,889
Finding release in that place

129
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,649
has allowed me to keep going on.

130
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,169
We are fairy-tale creatures.

131
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,970
Soon the world will become more modern, more logical.

132
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,820
But as it develops, there will no longer be a place

133
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,399
for vampires that should only exist in fairy tales.

134
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:04,730
Listen,

135
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,919
the leftover blood from Yokohama

136
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,960
seems to have been mixed with some Moon Blood.

137
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,039
That's the thing from Yoshiwara, right?

138
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,600
Good thing you noticed.

139
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,480
Is that true?

140
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:15,590
Yes.

141
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,639
The two vampires we dealt with at Kayabacho

142
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,720
also got addicted by drinking the Moon Blood.

143
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,070
It seems it is both addictive and capable of turning humans to vampires.

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,490
So it's poison, after all.

145
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,059
In controlled amount, it can also be used as medicine.

146
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,750
Poison is just poison,

147
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,480
it can't turn into medicine.

148
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,879
Suwa, chemistry is alchemy to turn poison into medicine.

149
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,259
That stink bomb is...

150
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,889
Let's leave this topic at that.

151
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Just thinking about it makes me sick.

152
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,559
Why do vampires want the Moon Blood so badly?

153
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:55,789
Because it gives them a feeling similar to drinking blood.

154
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,190
It's so hard to get human blood these days,

155
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,539
so the Moon Blood is a welcome substitute.

156
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,620
I see.

157
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:08,279
The truth hidden in the dark is not easily seen in the light.

158
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,509
Just like all of us gathered here.

159
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:19,440
You're right... we're all here... in what is now Tokyo.

160
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,659
If the sun rises any higher,

161
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,750
I will turn to ash.

162
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,629
If the water rises any higher, I will drown.

163
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,580
Which death should I choose?

164
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,740
How can you speak of death... so lightly?

165
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:45,250
I am sick of living in a world where there is no place for me.

166
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,289
You really are still a child.

167
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,009
I'm a lot older than you.

168
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,240
Only a very young child would

169
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,960
say they were sick of living.

170
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,299
Don't be like Shutaro, and make me worry like that.

171
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,990
Shutaro? You're talking about that guy?

172
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,370
Life...

173
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,889
Hey!

174
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,990
Damn.

175
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,549
Shutaro Kurusu!

176
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,720
Come and save this girl!

177
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,679
What?

178
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,779
Someone is calling for me...

179
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,639
Who?

180
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,759
Shush.

181
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,090
Tsukishima.

182
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,899
Aoi?

183
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,750
If you rush out now, you'll turn to ash.

184
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,409
Aoi's injured inside the Tsukishima facility.

185
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,039
If I don't go to save her now...

186
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,980
Even if you ran to Tsukishima, it would take a long time to get there.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,470
Long enough for us to turn to smoke.

188
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,200
If I could get there faster...

189
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,240
This thing, can it fly now?

190
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,879
No way.

191
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,940
We haven't done a test run,

192
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,570
or even tested if the parts can carry someone in-flight.

193
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,629
But, you made it to fly, right?

194
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,490
Only in theory.

195
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:21,960
Then I'm taking it.

196
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,070
Mr. Takeuchi, you made it, I'm sure it'll work.

197
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,490
That's a nice thing to say.

198
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,830
Give up.

199
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,250
I don't want to see a fried vampire.

200
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,110
I'm going.

201
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,100
If you put on this improved sunscreen,

202
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,250
it should mitigate some of the damage from the sun.

203
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,730
But don't forget.

204
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,370
Once a chemical reaction occurs under the wings

205
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,179
it's going to keep accumulating heat.

206
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,399
I understand.

207
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,820
You guys are really hot-blooded.

208
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,620
The King Kong Troop's equipment

209
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,759
is perfect for vampires to use for daytime maneuvers.

210
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,379
Except that being under that kite will be like a sauna.

211
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,399
It will be unbearably hot.

212
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,470
Just keep conscious and he'll be fine.

213
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,090
That's right.

214
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,629
Even with this flying device,

215
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,929
you may reach the temperature for combustion from here to Tsukishima.

216
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,620
It's like walking a tightrope.

217
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:23,070
The rest is up to your luck.

218
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,429
I usually don't pray to the gods, but I'll make an exception today.

219
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,549
If you want to pray to the gods, you have a lot of choices.

220
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:32,850
Which one is the best?

221
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,600
All of them.

222
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:37,950
Shutaro Kurusu.

223
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,759
The mission to save Aoi Shirase begins now!

224
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,220
I wish you good fortune.

225
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,490
Don't fall halfway.

226
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,570
Yes!

227
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,789
We'll see him off here.

228
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,339
You're late.

229
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,890
I thought I was on time.

230
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:14,869
I've been waiting a long time.

231
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,369
Me too.

232
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,309
Then, I'm truly sorry.

233
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,440
You're in a real hurry this time.

234
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,990
I have my own things to attend to.

235
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,220
I hope you understand.

236
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,140
What do you want to speak about?

237
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,079
Nakajima, you're already done.

238
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,759
This vampire unrest

239
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,099
is already out of your control.

240
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,890
Do you have a problem with my King Kong Troop?

241
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,640
They aren't your King Kong Troop.

242
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,950
We all know.

243
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,329
You're not in command of that unit.

244
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,809
That's right

245
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:54,789
The commander was from England.

246
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,369
A smart, young man named Rufus, I recall.

247
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,430
So we hope that you can take a step back,

248
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,910
and hand all power over to him.

249
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:13,140
You too,

250
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,250
have gone astray?

251
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,130
How could I, Rufus Glenn, go astray?

252
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,119
I've been on this path from the beginning.

253
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,240
Nakajima, we hope that you can take a step back.

254
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,009
You're just a human.

255
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,609
Do you really think you can beat me?

256
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,519
Just sit back quietly and watch me become king.

257
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,450
All's well that ends well.

258
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,480
A long, long time ago,

259
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,549
I had a family.

260
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,450
I had a mother,

261
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,900
a father

262
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,299
and a little brother.

263
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,789
I don't know why I was the only one who became like this.

264
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,279
The one who turned me into a vampire,

265
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,509
never drank blood again after that.

266
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,549
Perhaps she felt guilty for what she did to me.

267
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,789
As far as I know,

268
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,309
she is the only vampire who has ever starved to death.

269
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,109
No matter how hard I tried to make her drink, she wouldn't.

270
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,750
Before she died, she smiled at me and said,

271
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,759
"I feel so full."

272
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:49,980
Why are we stil alive?

273
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:01,940
What is that?

274
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,480
Aoi!

275
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,440
Aoi!

276
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:22,299
She's still alive.

277
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,349
Although I stopped the bleeding, she's still in danger.

278
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,490
Quick, get her out of here.

279
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,940
Okay.

280
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,430
What about you?

281
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,420
Me?

282
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,450
As long as a cloud covers the sun, it'll be all right.

283
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,490
But...

284
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,930
Juliet needs you,

285
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,480
Romeo.

286
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,009
It's alright, go.

287
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,069
Take care of yourself.

288
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,650
He's really flying.

289
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,559
Although it looks really dumb,

290
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:15,859
it's like

291
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,059
a fairy tale.

292
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,869
Rufus,

293
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,700
this is the second act.

294
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,410
Aoi, I'm going to save you.

295
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,890
I will protect you.

296
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,559
Shutaro,

297
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:56,220
promise...

298
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:57,390
Yes.

299
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,160
I promise.

300
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,380
CLOWN KING
