1
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,760
Make a barrier,

2
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,379
don't let a single vampire pass!

3
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,490
King Kong Troop...

4
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,370
If you yearn for the hidden power of the night,

5
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,280
why don't you join my troupe?

6
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm the commander of Special Forces Unit 16,

7
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,759
(CLOWN KING)
Rufus Glenn.

8
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:47,960
Vampires,

9
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,629
there are two paths before you.

10
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,210
The first,

11
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,250
is to obey us, and you can attain

12
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,770
a supply of blood and household registration.

13
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,000
The second, is to refuse to comply,

14
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,060
and you will be killed.

15
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,110
Heh.

16
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,979
You are not the lead here.

17
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,850
In Asakusa, Nihonbashi, Kyobashi

18
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,560
Hongo, and Kanda areas,

19
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:29,279
vampires are gaining in number, the guard system needs to be restructured.

20
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,509
If it goes on like this,

21
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,250
the vampires will break through the Marunouchi security perimeter.

22
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:39,319
The army's elite troops are doing their best to keep the city safe,

23
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,360
but they're not strong enough to hold back the vampires.

24
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,120
Understood.

25
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,889
Let Special Forces Unit 16 keep order in Marunouchi.

26
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,490
Thank you, sir.

27
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,779
Burn!

28
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,500
Burn all those stronger than me to ash!

29
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,329
Today is our last night of indulgence,

30
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,170
let's kill everyone in our way.

31
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,790
Thank you for your service.

32
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,329
Code Zero has realized your dreams, "former" Lt. General Nakajima.

33
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,959
I took the liberty of finishing your project.

34
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,870
As soon this work is done, all the soldiers will regroup.

35
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
It's an unbeatable force,

36
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,360
just not a human one.

37
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,970
You don't have regrets, right, old man?

38
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,910
Give yourself a clean death.

39
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,269
Now there's no one in the way, I'm the vampire king!

40
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,769
You know, we're going to cross the sea in that boat next

41
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,149
and create a new kingdom in another land.

42
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,680
For the coming world war, people over there

43
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,029
are preparing to build up an invincible army.

44
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,370
Interesting, isn't it?

45
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,370
What will happen to the children?

46
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,939
Children?

47
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,089
I'll prepare suitable replacements for you,

48
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,209
for I am the world.

49
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,870
Oh,

50
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,579
it's time to say goodbye to the ambassador.

51
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,699
You should wait on the boat.

52
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,040
I can't feel warmth or cold,

53
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,889
I'm a vampire...

54
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,990
Ambassador, sorry for making you wait.

55
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,709
Your invincible army has put on quite a show.

56
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,959
Why, thank you.

57
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,410
I'm sure they'll make a similar impression in your country.

58
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,050
I look forward to it.

59
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,709
Thank you.

60
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,689
Rufus, welcome.

61
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,740
You must be the lady of the house,

62
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,250
thank you for your invitation.

63
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,389
Rufus, I should go greet the Premier,

64
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,899
please look after my wife for me.

65
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,324
I'd be honored.

66
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,019
I'll leave you to it.

67
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,509
I wish I could stare at your handsome face forever.

68
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,730
Naturally, I'm always at your service.

69
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,860
How good it is to see the moon.

70
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,429
She is like a little piece of money.

71
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,909
A little silver flower.

72
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,440
The moon is cold and chaste.

73
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,620
I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty.

74
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:11,320
The lord hath come.

75
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,659
The son of man hath come.

76
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,580
Who was that, who cried out?

77
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,639
Although he's doing his best,

78
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,909
he's not as good at the performers in London.

79
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:22,990
Amazing!

80
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,929
If it can save one man's life,

81
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,860
take all of the treasures that you wish.

82
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,149
Thy voice is wine to me.

83
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:43,190
Let me hear that voice one more time...

84
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,129
Danny boy.

85
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,529
Deffrot...

86
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,809
I guess that's all we can expect from Code Zero.

87
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,990
To think, I held them in such high esteem.

88
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,559
Senbon Torii was a stage device used to deceive the enemy.

89
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,009
All the evidence was going to be destroyed,

90
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,129
and now they did the work for us.

91
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,179
Takeuchi.

92
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,360
This is where we part ways.

93
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,899
That's too bad.

94
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,889
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,389
You need to find Ayame, don't you?

96
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,549
It's me who let her get away.

97
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,220
I've got to finish this.

98
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,919
We'll be relying on Kurusu from here.

99
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,639
Can you give that to me?

100
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,440
Understood.

101
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,320
Take care.

102
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,740
That guy's a real downer.

103
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,169
As long as we're still alive, we'll meet him again.

104
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,149
Suwa and I will both be around for a long time.

105
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,730
Takeuchi.

106
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,090
Takeuchi, let's play oranges!

107
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,190
Let me think... huh?

108
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,769
Oranges.

109
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,120
Alright, then let's go back to Asakusa.

110
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,190
Watch your step.

111
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,169
This is for you.

112
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,190
Thank you.

113
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:17,519
Please, come in.

114
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,950
Thank you for everything.

115
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,210
This is for you.

116
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,169
Thank you so much.

117
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,279
It's nothing.

118
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,730
Who hasn't got any yet?

119
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,309
Is your injury better?

120
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,490
Yes!

121
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:29,039
It's completely healed.

122
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:32,879
Aoi, when you were brought here, you were on your deathbed.

123
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,700
You had me worried.

124
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,629
I'm grateful to all the vampires here.

125
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,409
Although I was scared of them at first, they're all good people.

126
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:50,340
I'd like to be like Tenmanya, helping out here from now on.

127
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,789
I see.

128
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,450
Have you seen Shutaro?

129
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,279
Kurusu should be inside.

130
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,360
Thank you!

131
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,620
How is the orange situation?

132
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,840
We're working on it.

133
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:14,100
These two are getting pretty good.

134
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,570
This will allow you to keep track of the King Kong Troop.

135
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,289
It's time.

136
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,659
Everything is ready, I'll let everyone know.

137
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,289
Thank you.

138
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,220
Then I'll also get started.

139
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,690
It's Takeuchi.

140
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,690
Understood.

141
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,230
Here you are.

142
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,669
Shutaro, you haven't eaten yet, right?

143
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,649
This is yours.

144
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,970
Vampires eat this, right?

145
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,529
I... I'm alright.

146
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,600
But, it's food.

147
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,389
I've still never drunk blood.

148
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,419
Then you're not like a vampire.

149
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,000
I am a vampire.

150
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,100
I can't go out into the sun.

151
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,350
Deffrot is also quite scared of the sun.

152
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,679
How about crosses?

153
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,720
They're fine.

154
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,000
But I can't smell garlic, dried fish or natto.

155
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,460
That's good.

156
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,139
What?

157
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,860
Haha.

158
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,980
Then, you really won't grow old?

159
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,230
I can't really believe it.

160
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,190
Do a vampire trick for me.

161
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,500
Like this?

162
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,129
Do you believe me now?

163
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,120
Yes.

164
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,980
Again!

165
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,029
Huh?

166
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,230
That disappearing trick!

167
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:03,090
Okay.

168
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,100
Shutaro?

169
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:09,980
Where did you go?

170
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,440
Everyone's already gone.

171
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,179
Huh?

172
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:17,559
To Tokyo station.

173
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,370
They won't be coming back.

174
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,899
Don't you want to go after them?

175
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,620
I understand.

176
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,450
Shutaro is a vampire,

177
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,139
and I am a human.

178
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,269
We can't be together forever.

179
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,850
Even if I wanted to follow them,

180
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,580
I couldn't.

181
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,570
You're right, vampires are different from us,

182
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,179
if they're injured they can recover so fast,

183
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,009
they don't age,

184
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,509
but they also have doubts about what they're living for.

185
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,740
In this moonlit night,

186
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,059
we laugh and we cry,

187
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,360
we sometimes make mistakes,

188
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:04,440
or do the right thing.

189
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,659
Vampires and humans are the same in this respect.

190
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,330
But, if there's something you want to say, don't wait.

191
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,909
Unlike them, our time is limited.

192
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,139
Huh?

193
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,679
I'm giving this back.

194
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,399
Shopkeeper.

195
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,059
I'm here.

196
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,340
The roads are dangerous... at night.

197
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,149
Understood.

198
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,269
I hope it goes well.

199
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,629
Why... is he still alive?

200
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,100
Damn it, what is the King Kong Troop doing?

201
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,429
Aren't they guarding nearby?

202
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,769
Get over here, everyone! I'm here!

203
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,259
Damn it.

204
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,379
Tokyo station?

205
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,919
King Kong Troop, where is it?

206
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,509
You're too slow!

207
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,110
You're... Code Zero.

208
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,830
Weren't you killed in that fire?

209
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:35,669
I've finally found you.

210
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,710
You were looking for me? Do you work for Deffrot too?

211
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,840
Is it like that?

212
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,490
What?

213
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,519
Stay back... Go away...

214
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,029
Where is the scary man now?

215
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,429
Here!

216
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,840
I see.

217
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,779
-I pointed it out first.
-No, I did!

218
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:00,929
-It was me.
-No, it was me!

219
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,289
Kurusu.

220
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,799
We're counting on you.

221
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:10,059
Nearby members of the public, please evacuate quickly.

222
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,839
As fast as you can.

223
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,430
Members of the public?

224
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,259
You mean me?

225
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,630
King Kong Troop, kill this guy.

226
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:42,660
But I'm...

227
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:45,289
the vampire king.

228
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,440
I'm the king...

229
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,700
What the heck! I'm king of the world!

230
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm the vampire king!

231
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,829
Mr. Rufus.

232
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,470
Ugh!

233
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,710
I'll take you to your room.

234
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:29,539
This is my room?

235
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,380
How long until we reach America?

236
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,460
About two weeks on this route.

237
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,930
Don't look at me with that dumb grin.

238
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,059
Repulsive.

239
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,390
I'm going to rest.

240
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,170
Don't knock on my door, even if it's the end of the world.

241
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,259
Have a good journey.

242
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,319
You've woken up from that dream?

243
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,900
Then I'll just prepare another for you.

244
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:17,630
Lately, I've been having strange dreams.

245
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,000
I dreamt that I wasn't a vampire.

246
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,049
So stupid.

247
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,950
Sleep forever, Danny Boy.

248
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:34,970
Suwa...

249
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,369
Are you here to kill me for betraying you?

250
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,799
Fine, kill me.

251
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,460
I can't survive by myself anyway.

252
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,750
You want to die, huh?

253
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,519
The sun will be out soon.

254
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:10,480
No!

255
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,539
Why would you do that?

256
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,450
This is what death is.

257
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,650
If you really wanted to die, you would've been dead.

258
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,529
But, you're still alive,

259
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,579
even if you don't know why,

260
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,490
you're still alive.

261
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,269
I was created by that man,

262
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,509
but I don't want to...

263
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,519
I don't want that dirty blood running through my body.

264
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,460
Inside my body is the blood of many vampires.

265
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:55,140
Your blood is not as dirty as mine.

266
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,720
But, I...

267
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,460
We don't rely on blood to survive,

268
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,809
we rely on our hearts.

269
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,400
Isn't that right?

270
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,940
If you can't survive by yourself,

271
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,660
then go on living with me.

272
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,519
You don't need to worry about the children, they're fine.

273
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,920
How about a change of scenery to lift our spirits?

274
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:39,970
What is Your Name, Weakling?
