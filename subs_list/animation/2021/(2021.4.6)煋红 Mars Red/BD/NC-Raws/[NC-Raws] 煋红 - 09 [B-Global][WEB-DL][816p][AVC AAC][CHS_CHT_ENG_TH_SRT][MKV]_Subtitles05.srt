00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(THIS ANIMATION IS A FICTION BASED ON ITS ERA.
ALL CHARACTERS, GROUPS, LAWS, NAMES AND SO ON ARE FICTIONAL.)

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,320
(MARS RED)

3
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,019
It really was demolished.

4
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,689
Everyone has disappeared.

5
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,000
Sono, Yo, looks like you're having fun.

6
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,759
We're pretending to have fun.

7
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,419
Huh?

8
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,840
Why can't we go out?

9
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,969
Because it's safer here at Tenmaya's place.

10
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,389
I know.

11
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,930
But I'm already bored of playing house.

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,389
Did you find them?

13
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,020
Huh?

14
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,810
Monsters?

15
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,439
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

16
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,030
That's right.

17
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,650
But I haven't found anyone yet.

18
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,409
Did you try asking Ayame?

19
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,199
Huh?

20
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,039
Ayame, she knows a lot of things.

21
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,539
Your friends?

22
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,710
Yes, we fought vampires together.

23
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,840
Do you know something?

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,009
Anything would be helpful.

25
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,639
It's not good news...

26
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,509
That's okay. Can you tell me?

27
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,639
They say that someone is killing child vampires,

28
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,560
wearing a strange mask

29
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,979
and wielding a knife of some sort.

30
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,400
And "Red Glasses" are also close by.

31
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,280
It was because of this

32
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,409
that I ran from my old hiding place.

33
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,120
Even after meeting Sono and Yo

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,659
I have still been living in fear

35
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,750
of the masked man.

36
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,129
Where were you before?

37
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,379
Near Tsukishima.

38
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,430
(Episode 9 Doubts)

39
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:50,229
Shopkeeper.

40
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,599
Yes?

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,110
Have you seen the boss of Code Zero?

42
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,939
He left about an hour ago.

43
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,000
If you need to find him, I can...

44
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,449
Don't worry, it's nothing urgent.

45
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,680
I know.

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,659
He went to Tsukishima.

47
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,199
Tsukishima?

48
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,500
Hide-and-seek.

49
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,120
Yo, shut up!

50
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,710
He seemed to be looking for someone.

51
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,550
Those people...

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,259
it shouldn't be hard to find them, though.

53
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,220
This world is not so peaceful.

54
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,029
Oh no, I can't go back like this.

55
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,209
Are they the "Red Glasses" people speak of?

56
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,930
Be good tonight, "Danny Boy".

57
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,569
It looks like an unexpected prey has taken the bait.

58
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,449
Finish the job and come back before dawn.

59
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,300
Code Zero is over there.

60
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,089
It seems like the King Kong Troop aren't here.

61
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,680
Suwa, sir, this is Kurusu.

62
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,949
Are you here?

63
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,110
"Let me hear that voice one more time, John."

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,500
Sa... lo... me?

65
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,550
I am Lieutenant Colonel Maeda of Special Forces Unit 16.

66
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,589
Mr. Maeda?

67
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,089
Suwa, Takeuchi, obliterate our enemy vampires.

68
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,360
This, of course, includes artificial vampires.

69
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,899
Child vampires are also targets.

70
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,060
Don't let your emotions sway you.

71
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,810
Child...

72
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,649
Even child vampires?

73
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,319
Shutaro Kurusu, he is also a threat.

74
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,399
If you find him, eliminate him immediately.

75
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,990
I repeat, eliminate Shutaro Kurusu.

76
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,220
I wish you good fortune in the war to come.

77
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,459
Mr. Maeda! Where are you?

78
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,290
What did I do wrong?

79
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,670
Mr. Maeda! If you're there, show yourself!

80
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,720
Where is he...?

81
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,439
Mr. Suwa!

82
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,569
Kurusu, you're still alive?

83
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,839
Mr. Suwa, why...?

84
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,429
Why...?

85
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,009
They say that someone is killing child vampires.

86
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,679
Why?

87
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,120
I'm impressed.

88
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,750
Ready, ready.

89
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,929
This is...

90
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,720
I-It stinks.

91
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,100
What do you think of my stink bomb?

92
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,649
Isn't it really effective against vampires?

93
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,029
Takeuchi, what have you done?

94
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,620
Why are two friends fighting?

95
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,990
"Friends"? Weren't you told to eliminate me?

96
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,120
Ah, you heard that recording?

97
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,379
We're the nuisances that were pushed out of

98
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,710
Special Forces Unit 16.

99
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,299
To fall for that kind of trap...

100
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,929
You're really not suited to being a soldier.

101
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,470
Trap?

102
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,509
Maeda would never wish everyone "good fortune".

103
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,269
Suwa, too.

104
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,600
You're the older one, you should pay more attention.

105
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
It's almost dawn.

106
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,149
The King Kong Troop will be coming back.

107
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,620
I also got what I wanted.

108
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,779
You should get to a safe place.

109
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,919
Can I trust you?

110
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:30,710
Trust what?

111
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,110
You guys.

112
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,649
That's your decision,

113
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,090
not ours.

114
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,220
Suwa, let's go.

115
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,429
Okay.

116
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,730
Wait, I'm going with you!

117
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,990
Maeda.

118
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,159
Maeda would never wish everyone "good fortune".

119
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:08,960
Things aren't working out the way I'd hoped.

120
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,789
And I went to all the trouble of preparing this.

121
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,759
Let's clean up this mess.

122
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,879
Lt. General Nakajima likes things clean.

123
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:27,559
"Danny boy, la, la, la, la, la"

124
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,769
"La, la, la, la"

125
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,659
I can still smell that stink bomb.

126
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,080
I added natto to make the smell permeate more.

127
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,620
If there's a next time, you'll be sorry...

128
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,330
I think this place also smells pretty bad.

129
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:55,590
That...

130
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:57,340
What?

131
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,919
What happened to you two after Yokohama?

132
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:05,220
We tracked the King Kong Troop successfully.

133
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,509
But there were too many of them,

134
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,309
we were still observing them when that earthquake hit.

135
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,389
Although we were worried about the Code Zero HQ,

136
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,519
we took advantage of the chaos

137
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,940
to escape to a private hideout.

138
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,110
How about you guys?

139
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,649
General Yamagami?

140
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,409
Is he dead?

141
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,950
Anything from Maeda?

142
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,500
I still haven't seen him,

143
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,120
but I think he's alright.

144
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,539
The person who sent Yamagami's remains

145
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,919
was Lt. Colonel Maeda.

146
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,379
But, that voice,

147
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,220
really wasn't Lt. Colonel Maeda?

148
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,600
It must have been faked.

149
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,970
Only the voice sounds exactly like him.

150
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,929
Why would someone do that...?

151
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,059
The King Kong Troop are now complete.

152
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,730
"Old-models" like us have become a thorn in their side.

153
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,940
Just like children.

154
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,360
We came to Tsukishima to investigate something.

155
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Why are you here, Kurusu?

156
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:10,950
What?

157
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,789
I heard that Suwa was killing young vampires.

158
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,960
Ah, that.

159
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,710
I have "also" killed child vampires, I don't deny that.

160
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,929
Let's get out of here.

161
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,350
It's almost dawn.

162
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,100
Want to use this?

163
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,190
Huh?

164
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:39,899
It's my handmade sunscreen lotion.

165
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,360
It's a popular product.

166
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,149
I can give you a little.

167
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,409
You're a businessman now after being a researcher?

168
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,779
It will give you three minutes of sun protection.

169
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,330
I'll give you a good price.

170
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,039
I don't need that kind of thing.

171
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,789
Then we...

172
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,210
Let's go.

173
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,049
Okay.

174
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:17,100
The sun is always watching.

175
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,419
Where should we escape to?

176
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,730
Good question.

177
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,259
How about Tenmaya's place?

178
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,360
He's safe?

179
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,440
He took refuge elsewhere.

180
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,820
Senbon Torii?

181
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:29,450
You know it?

182
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,490
I've been there a few times.

183
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,740
Right, Suwa?

184
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,039
What's wrong?

185
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,250
Child vampires.

186
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,669
So there're also child vampires nearby.

187
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,169
Was he turned by the vaccine?

188
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,340
I'm afraid so.

189
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,559
Although it doesn't taste good,

190
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,309
it can sate their cravings.

191
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,190
No!

192
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,440
Why did you stop me?

193
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,950
The three of us can't save everyone.

194
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,000
Trust me, I have lived 300 years longer than you.

195
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,799
Do you know why there are so few child vampires?

196
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,129
Because they don't live very long.

197
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,779
We can't stay under the sun,

198
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,549
we sink in water,

199
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:35,509
we can't resist the smell of blood.

200
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,149
Because we don't age,

201
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,429
we can't stay in one place for too long.

202
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,149
To live a hundred times longer than a human is difficult,

203
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,809
for creatures like vampires.

204
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,120
Welcome back!

205
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,990
Children?

206
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,620
These kids are alright.

207
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,539
Did you find them?

208
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:00,500
Yes.

209
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,789
What do we have here?

210
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,500
These children were turned into vampires by the vaccine,

211
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,840
we are keeping them safe here for now.

212
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,470
Hello, everyone.

213
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,159
Welcome.

214
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,169
Shopkeeper, long time no see.

215
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,720
The young master is also inside.

216
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,759
It's so rare!

217
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,570
Three fully conscious and rational child vampires!

218
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,740
That vaccine really had a powerful effect.

219
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,700
It's impressive.

220
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,500
What was the vaccine made of?

221
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,029
It must be a mixture of my research materials

222
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,659
and the imported Moon Blood from Yokohama.

223
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,580
It must be what Nakajima was making in Akahane.

224
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,419
That scoundrel Nakajima...

225
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,129
What's wrong?

226
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,470
That man, isn't he the killer from the stories?

227
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
It's alright. Suwa is a good guy.

228
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,850
But... he's scary...

229
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:06,900
Why do you keep staring at me?

230
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,269
Sorry.

231
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,859
If you are with Kurusu,

232
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,220
you must be a good person.

233
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,450
You must decide for yourself if I'm a good person.

234
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,319
Huh?

235
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,619
Only you can decide.

236
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,579
But,

237
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,700
it must be hard to feed

238
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,750
this many vampires, right?

239
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,460
It's just like you said.

240
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,380
We've been too busy to attend to all,

241
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,930
but there are more and more vampires because of the vaccine.

242
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,180
The Tenmaya motto is to grant what is needed.

243
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:44,519
If we keep on like this, there's going to be trouble.

244
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,230
To avoid that,

245
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,309
we want to transport the vampires to another place.

246
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,900
Do you have somewhere in mind?

247
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,400
Until now, we've only heard

248
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,240
that there is a secret vampire hide-out

249
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,990
in this quarry.

250
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:59,700
Suwa, have you heard about this?

251
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,029
No.

252
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,369
Since this place hasn't been exposed before,

253
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,660
it must be pretty secluded.

254
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,460
So I plan to send the shopkeeper to do reconnaissance.

255
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,210
I see.

256
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,089
Since we still have a lot to prepare,

257
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,259
we need to wait until winter to make our move.

258
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,220
We'll have to play it by ear.

259
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,849
Regarding the food supply, I have an idea.

260
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,230
Really?

261
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,190
It should be enough for now at least.

262
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,569
But we'll need to get our hands a little dirty first.

263
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,990
I'm sure these two won't mind.

264
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:37,650
Huh?

265
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,319
So you're relying on us after all?

266
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,819
That's right, it's up to you guys!

267
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:43,910
What?

268
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:46,619
Nothing.

269
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,079
You've made an enemy.

270
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,289
She didn't like me from the start.

271
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
This again? You really crave approval.

272
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:56,759
Shut up.

273
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,380
The King Kong Troop demonstrated

274
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,099
their skills by keeping public order after the earthquake.

275
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:08,980
I believe it's time to move towards their formal employment.

276
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,730
What you say is true,

277
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,190
but we have other priorities right now.

278
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,650
The whole world is watching Tokyo.

279
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,569
Although security is important,

280
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,740
we must recover from the earthquake as fast as possible

281
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,660
to prove that we are a developed nation.

282
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,910
We need to keep in line with

283
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,410
the government decision to reduce military spending.

284
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:33,170
I see, speaking of that,

285
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,880
the corpulent monsters with red glasses have terrified the public.

286
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,720
We need to win back the trust of the citizens,

287
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,549
not strengthen our military power.

288
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,309
These troops are indefatigable, correct?

289
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,180
Wouldn't it be more effective to use them as engineers?

290
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,400
That's right! Good point!

291
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:59,529
Wouldn't it violate policy to let them do that?

292
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:05,990
Nakajima, these are the times we are in.

293
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,160
That's right.

294
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,450
The team also did a lot for the Ryounkaku explosion.

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,920
No matter if they're vampires or soldiers,

296
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,960
now is the time to use them.

297
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,759
Then, I will leave the vampire problem to you.

298
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,890
But, let's leave the employment of the King Kong Troop

299
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,430
until after Tokyo has recovered.

300
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,720
Is that good?

301
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,069
What do these short-sighted people know?

302
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,660
Come, Danny Boy, it's time to eat.

303
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,710
After autumn, winter comes.

304
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,130
And it will be time for your debut.

305
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,559
Why are the curtains still closed in the middle of the day?

306
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,849
Stop.

307
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:19,940
Deffrot, you're awake?

308
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,569
I haven't slept much since the earthquake.

309
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,490
I was trying to sleep, don't disturb me.

310
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,329
But it's better to go outside during the day.

311
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,539
You can't go out at night because of the vampires.

312
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:48,180
I already left the stage.

313
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,970
That kind of third-rate acting is really hard to watch.
