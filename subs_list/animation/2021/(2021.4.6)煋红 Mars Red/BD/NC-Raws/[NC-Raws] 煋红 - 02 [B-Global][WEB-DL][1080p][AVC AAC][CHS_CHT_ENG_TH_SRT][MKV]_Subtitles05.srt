00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,044
THIS ANIMATION IS A FICTION BASED ON ITS ERA.
ALL CHARACTERS, GROUPS, LAWS, NAMES AND SO ON ARE FICTIONAL.

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,299
12TH YEAR OF TAISHO, SIBERIA.

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,353
Behind... you.

4
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:18,118
Till Death Do Us Part

5
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,144
Here you are!

6
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:43,645
What's up? Vampire?

7
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:44,937
Yes, in Kayabacho (A place in Tokyo).

8
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:48,275
How's that case going?

9
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:50,193
Not confirmed yet.

10
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:53,405
Go check if there are anyone who just moved in.

11
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:57,700
You mean there's a vampire lurking near the crime scene?

12
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,828
If you're in an unfamiliar area,

13
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:01,705
you'd probably choose the nearest place to hunt.

14
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,539
Send the whole special agent team to search.

15
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:05,917
Really? The special agent team?

16
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:11,840
Of course.

17
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,259
Chief!

18
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:16,635
This is a big case!

19
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,513
Someone just got burned and died like that.

20
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:20,139
Human spontaneous combustion in Tokyo Station.

21
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,849
And there were witnesses.

22
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,225
Silly girl.

23
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:26,395
We don't do any supernatural events!

24
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:29,816
Most of our readers are modern girls.

25
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,906
How's the elopement case of the Empire Theater's missing actress going?

26
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:39,199
Yes! Miss Misaki, the actress acting Salome.

27
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,870
I like her so much.

28
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,372
I didn't expect that she'd elope for love. How romantic!

29
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,001
Though a bit suspicious,

30
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,919
but love surpasses name and family,

31
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,421
and it'll burn till end of the world.

32
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,716
You'll be more excited if you hear that, won't you?

33
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:55,842
Exactly I will.

34
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,052
Listen, forget about the guy who got burned.

35
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,138
Go investigate the fiery romance of the elopement.

36
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:01,973
Yes, sir!

37
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,227
ROMEO STARRED BY DEFFROT
JULIET STARRED BY SANJO CHIYO

38
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,812
It's Romeo and Juliet now.

39
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,816
But Miss Misaki's Salome was so good.

40
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:17,363
A rose even by a different name would smell just as sweet.

41
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:25,788
Ah, Romeo?

42
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:26,956
Shh.

43
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:30,125
Miss, do you like Miss Misaki?

44
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,295
Why is Miss Misaki missing?

45
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:34,380
I heard she eloped. Is that true? With whom?

46
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,550
Miss, who are you?

47
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,261
I'm Shirase Aoi from Capital News.

48
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:41,637
CAPITAL NEWS. THE IMMORAL LOVE AFFAIR OF THE FAMOUS ACTRESS.

49
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:44,516
The press that only reports nonsense and weird stuffs.

50
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:47,142
But I actually do want to cover real events.

51
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,937
The truth of human spontaneous combustion and the elopement.

52
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:52,690
Is that all?

53
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,442
I'm looking for a person.

54
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,529
My childhood friend who went to Siberia and never came back again.

55
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:01,783
He promised me that he will not die.

56
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,040
I want to die if it's okay…

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,041
No way. Drink it.

58
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,877
Is there no way around this?

59
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:18,257
Of course not. This is the only thing that we can have.

60
00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:20,757
Though you won't die even if you don't drink it,

61
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:21,636
you will be dried up as a salted fish.

62
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:23,971
I don't want to be like dried salted fish.

63
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,559
It won't be a problem if you just see it as turtle blood.

64
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:31,062
I don't like turtle, either.

65
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,939
Forget about it already.

66
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,108
We're not human anymore.

67
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,110
We are the King Kong soldiers of our country.

68
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,197
We are vampires.

69
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:43,992
But we are not so that different from human beings.

70
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:46,745
We might die as well if shot by pistols.

71
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,665
So do you want to have a try?

72
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:53,709
Ouch! It hurts! It really hurts!

73
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:55,545
Stop it! Stop it!

74
00:05:57,463 --> 00:05:58,339
Mr. Yamagami!

75
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,716
See? You're fine.

76
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,302
Vampires are so powerful.

77
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:04,428
Enough, Takeuchi.

78
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:07,264
It's okay. You'll recover anyway.

79
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:11,310
Even if you are injured, you can heal after taking blood.

80
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,875
And your senses of taste and smell will be more acute

81
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,817
if you become a rare A-level.

82
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,735
Totally different from you guys, who're not even in the ranking.

83
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:22,613
Thank you for letting us know!

84
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:25,949
This is the candy made from blood.

85
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,954
It was prepared for emergencies. Wanna try?

86
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,670
The captain is calling us.

87
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,548
Has he recovered from the injury? No more recuperation needed?

88
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:43,802
We haven't met the captain yet.

89
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,220
What kind of person is he?

90
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,139
Must be an inexperienced young guy from Yichikayatai.

91
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,182
Let me train him.

92
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,894
I'm Colonel Maeda Yoshinobu.

93
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:55,687
From now on, Zero is under my command.

94
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:58,774
You, as King Kong soldiers, need to use the power of vampires

95
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:01,235
to engage in espionage and special missions.

96
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:06,490
Your mission is to search, arrest or kill the vampires lurking in Tokyo

97
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,910
who might attack humans indiscriminately.

98
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,663
What's the matter, Yamagami?

99
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:13,997
Why are you staring at me like that?

100
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:16,084
Why you?

101
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:18,670
Call me Colonel Maeda, Mr. Not-in-the-ranking.

102
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,754
Pardon?

103
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:22,132
We graduated in the same year in Yichikayatai.

104
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,341
But I outrank you in in official ranking.

105
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:27,803
and your vampire level is lower than Senior Soldier Kurusu.

106
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,264
How ironic!

107
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:30,514
Maeda!

108
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:31,723
Maeda?

109
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:35,853
Colonel Maeda.

110
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,982
Very good, Major Yamamori.

111
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,233
You hillbilly from Pan Island.

112
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,610
Kurusu Shutaro,

113
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,281
bitten by an S-class vampire, the only A-class vampire in our country.

114
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:49,033
I can't tell it from your appearance.

115
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,785
I feel the same way.

116
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:53,872
But you're the least like human of us all.

117
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:59,002
Give full play to your abilities in real battles.

118
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:00,545
Real battles?

119
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,298
If our vampires' body fluids get into the human body,

120
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:08,093
then most people will die of poisoning.

121
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:09,387
Poisoning?

122
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:12,139
So we're lucky dogs?

123
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,391
That depends.

124
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:17,894
The problem is that those who survive and become vampires

125
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:20,648
have to take in blood.

126
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:24,526
Although they won't be starved to death as easily as humans,

127
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:30,199
they'll instinctively crave for more blood.

128
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:34,537
Cut the crap. Who should I kill?

129
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:38,291
There are increasing reports of human spontaneous combustion.

130
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:42,836
That means the lurking vampires are exposed to the sun.

131
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:46,216
There used to be few reports like this every year.

132
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:48,176
But seven cases already occurred just in this month.

133
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,928
What happened in Tokyo Station a few days ago was the eighth one.

134
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:54,599
Our investigation will be centered on these eight places.

135
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:59,479
How great it would be if we can find all the vampires living in seclusion.

136
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,398
Um... I have a question.

137
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,195
Many people will die of poisoning after being bitten by vampires, right?

138
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,864
But why can't we find their bodies?

139
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:12,783
Maybe someone's handling the blood,

140
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:15,787
or hiding the bodies of the poisoned.

141
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,539
The place for handling blood.

142
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,250
Butcher's shops or hospitals.

143
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,753
There's one more place.

144
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:29,008
TENMANYA

145
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,318
Wow.

146
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:53,950
I haven't played piano for quite a long time.

147
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,534
You can play piano?

148
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:58,288
What do you think of me?

149
00:09:58,288 --> 00:09:59,871
Please don't touch it.

150
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,419
Things are so old here that they'll break easily.

151
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,041
So you are introduced by Mr. Takeuchi.

152
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,313
Yeah, he said that you had the information we wanted.

153
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:27,482
Yes. In this Tenmanya,

154
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:30,360
we have guests all day long.

155
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,364
The information you want is right here.

156
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,658
Are you a vampire, too?

157
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,827
Look carefully. This one is a human.

158
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:41,496
Are humans helping vampires?

159
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:43,541
It's a long story.

160
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,833
Don't waste time.

161
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,837
We just want to know how vampires get the blood.

162
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:51,048
You mean the blood-trading house?

163
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:52,674
Blood-trading house?

164
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:56,011
As the name suggests, it's the place to sell blood.

165
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,597
Mixed with sodium citrate for blood transfusion,

166
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:01,893
the blood will be hard to coagulate. That's how they process it.

167
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:05,562
We once monopolized the industry to provide blood for our customers.

168
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:09,734
You were the provider? Then do you know where those vampires lurk?

169
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,070
I don't know and I won't tell you even if I do.

170
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,071
What?

171
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,530
Mr. Yamagami, he's still a kid.

172
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,119
It's the end for a businessman if he gives away his customers.

173
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:24,206
Tenmanya will never touch this bottom line.

174
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:30,046
But recently, new competitors have emerged elsewhere.

175
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:32,340
In this case, it's okay to give them away.

176
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,758
Who are they?

177
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:37,220
I don't know, but...

178
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,306
What do you want?

179
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:42,725
This is a business for me.

180
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:47,938
I'm kidding. Just help me destroy my competitors.

181
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:50,692
Shopkeeper, bring that to me.

182
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,541
Thank you.

183
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,827
This is for you.

184
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:03,120
What is it?

185
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,667
A reproduction of our products, sold by our competitors.

186
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,755
No, you can't do that, Masakichi.

187
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:15,924
Don't worry, just listen to me.

188
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:24,933
How's the Moon Blood?

189
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,522
So bad you are.

190
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:32,649
We should drink like we did last night.

191
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:35,153
But we would both lose our shelters.

192
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:38,197
I know, however...

193
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:39,740
Huh?

194
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,368
We can't drink anymore.

195
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,578
Got it.

196
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:48,331
Let's run away and live a life of our own,

197
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:51,626
just like Okaru and Kanpei in Kabuki did.

198
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:55,089
Ah? They all died in the end, didn't they?

199
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,884
You are so cute.

200
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:08,144
Fire!

201
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:16,152
How's the selection of the army?

202
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,403
No use.

203
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:19,113
What?

204
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:22,408
Our enemies are vampires. The Type 38 rifles won't help.

205
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,869
We are thinking about improving firepower.

206
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:28,371
We'd better keep grenades and Type 3 heavy machine guns at hand.

207
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:31,208
But we're in the city. Are they tanks or something?

208
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,085
If only they are tanks.

209
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:35,169
Tanks are big targets and move slowly.

210
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:38,090
But vampires can disappear right in front of you.

211
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,802
So we have to use this in the end.

212
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:43,303
If we fail, we may die,

213
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:45,264
or become vampires.

214
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:48,893
I wish I could drag them to the sun before that.

215
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:52,062
Assemble our men and search for their caskets.

216
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,105
Yes, sir!

217
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:05,659
The search must be done in pairs.

218
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:09,120
Avoid being alone and be careful not to run into the shadows.

219
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,206
We are eyes and ears.

220
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:16,336
It's meaningful to use both hands and feet to look for what we need.

221
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:18,880
Garbage is what we need to rummage through.

222
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,424
Do not neglect anything even if it's as small as sesame.

223
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,094
Dismiss.

224
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,261
Yes, sir!

225
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,240
Hi, officer?

226
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:45,991
It's you from the press.

227
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:47,784
My name is Shirase Aoi.

228
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:51,038
Are you investigating the case of human spontaneous combustion?

229
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:54,375
Human spontaneous combustion? How is that possible?

230
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,628
But I believe it.

231
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:01,423
What an imaginative woman.

232
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:04,634
That's how Shutaro used to say.

233
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:05,927
Shutaro?

234
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:07,804
He's my childhood friend.

235
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:12,183
He was in the army, but I was informed of his death not long ago.

236
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:14,227
I see.

237
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,065
Is this your lover?

238
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:19,149
No.

239
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,902
Then why do you give her flowers?

240
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:25,740
Because I didn't keep my word. That's all.

241
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:31,953
The flower language of asters is that I won't forget you.

242
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:35,957
So they're definitely for his lover who passed away.

243
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,809
Um..

244
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,354
Here you are.

245
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:02,360
I already know your hobbits.

246
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,903
Did you find it in the garbage?

247
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:04,695
Yeah.

248
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:06,322
And where?

249
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,366
A courtyard near Kayabacho.

250
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:14,580
Block the bridge and roads at midnight, and dispatch Zero.

251
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,581
Got that.

252
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,457
Thank you.

253
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:18,292
You are welcome.

254
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,383
Will this be the last try?

255
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,969
Or?

256
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,267
The trap has been set.

257
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:39,522
But is that okay? There's a gap in Hamacho.

258
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,649
Leave it alone. Let's go.

259
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:42,774
Yes, sir.

260
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,701
Residents have been arranged to take refuge.

261
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:54,202
Thanks.

262
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,009
A pair?

263
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:12,887
Let's go.

264
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,104
A vampire couple? Not decent at all.

265
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:28,903
Bastards!

266
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:29,989
Please don't.

267
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:31,906
They are no more than a few dozen humans.

268
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,616
That's how we've been doing.

269
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:35,536
I have a bad feeling.

270
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,454
Are you too old to take a risk?

271
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,832
After all you're a hundred years older than me.

272
00:17:39,832 --> 00:17:42,792
No, I'm worried about you.

273
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,421
Since you bought the blood in Yokohama...

274
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:46,672
Stop nagging!

275
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:48,840
I've had enough of hiding.

276
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,259
I said no.

277
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:58,517
We can't go back.

278
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:02,188
After being targeted by them, we'll be either arrested or separated.

279
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,480
Shh.

280
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,067
We're surrounded. This way.

281
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:13,699
It doesn't let us go.

282
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:15,159
Knock it away.

283
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,951
But that's the minister's car.

284
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:20,038
I'll take the responsibility. Just do it.

285
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,710
Honey, is it really gonna be okay?

286
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,795
Stop it.

287
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:27,587
Here they come just as we predicted.

288
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:30,465
Mr. Maeda is really something.

289
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:32,718
Who goes first?

290
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:35,930
Well… Are you vampires?

291
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,263
Get out of the way, you brat.

292
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:38,932
Honey, don't do that.

293
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:40,768
This guy is dangerous.

294
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,019
How is this kid dangerous?

295
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:44,605
How shall I put it…

296
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:48,526
-Honey, can't you even notice this?
-Please surrender if it's possible.

297
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:50,903
Or are you willing to work with us?

298
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:56,407
Vampires!

299
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:58,993
You have two choices.

300
00:18:58,993 --> 00:18:59,912
First!

301
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:02,080
Yield to our 16th Special Agent Team.

302
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:04,750
We will provide blood and registered residence for you.

303
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,125
Another option!

304
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:10,338
If you refuse to obey, you will be killed right here.

305
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:11,132
Fire!

306
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,019
How dare you fool me!

307
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,711
Honey.

308
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:51,462
Please surrender.

309
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:55,134
Please live on, Kanpei.

310
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:56,468
Kanpei?

311
00:19:56,468 --> 00:20:00,388
Drama becomes reality.

312
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:11,400
That one is the original vampire.

313
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,734
Kurusu!

314
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:17,071
Vampires,

315
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:20,116
You have two choices.

316
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:23,703
Love and cherry blossoms have both come to the end.

317
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:37,759
But you have no other choice.

318
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,813
So will he die of poisoning,

319
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,148
or become a vampire? It's fifty-fifty…

320
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,275
Oh.

321
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:03,160
I'll leave it to you, Moriyama.

322
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:07,455
Colonel.

323
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:21,135
Ah, it was a precious experiment.

324
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:57,506
It's enough for me to be the only demon.

325
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:40,079
Meet in the Dream
