1
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,939
Vampires,

2
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,120
you have two choices.

3
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:59,060
First, as long as you yield to Special Forces Unit 16,

4
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,319
we will provide you blood and registered residence.

5
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,360
Instead, if you refuse to yield...

6
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:13,340
A vampire!

7
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,919
Let me in! Please! Open the door!

8
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,620
No! Don't come any closer!

9
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,229
Special Forces!

10
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,939
I'm Shutaro Kurusu from Special Forces Unit 16!

11
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,719
Do you know where the others are?

12
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:57,289
(Episode 8 The Purgatory)

13
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,259
What a dangerous world.

14
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,580
Over and over. This time it's the vampire.

15
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,830
What the hell is wrong?

16
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,509
Don't you want to run away, Santaro?

17
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,360
What nonsense! I was born and raised in Asakusa.

18
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,769
I've spent my whole life here. Even if I die, I'd like to die here.

19
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,829
Having said that, now the world is not what it used to be.

20
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,170
Tenmanya has also gone somewhere else.

21
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,959
Do you know where they have gone?

22
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,079
I'm also looking for them,

23
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,740
but I don't have a clue.

24
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:35,569
Hey, Santaro, have you got the vaccine from the army?

25
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,250
Who are you, idiot?

26
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,480
You fool.

27
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,019
If you don't drink it, you'll be infected and become a vampire.

28
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,920
Infected?

29
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:47,300
The guards of the army seem to have said so.

30
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,000
So both of you have got the vaccine?

31
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,420
Of course.

32
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,790
Hey!

33
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,629
Good work for patrolling.

34
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:58,730
Thank you!

35
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,410
Here's the supply from the general.

36
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,029
Thanks.

37
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,560
Please continue to patrol carefully.

38
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,589
Carefully.

39
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,680
If you want free bread, please line up here.

40
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,089
Here you are.

41
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,290
Thanks.

42
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:36,500
Here...

43
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:37,519
Good work.

44
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,269
Chief Editor? What are you doing here?

45
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,980
I could ask the same thing about you. You're here to help?

46
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,459
Everyone is experiencing a tough time.

47
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,540
The news agency closed down and I'm out of work.

48
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,410
Things aren't as bad as you think.

49
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,329
Come back tomorrow.

50
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,629
I've booked accommodations.

51
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,680
The vampire. If we don't report this incident, who else will?

52
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,079
I've been waiting for it!

53
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,209
What? You're giving it all to me?

54
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,360
No. I'm going to cover the story. Please hand out the bread.

55
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,079
Hey.

56
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,839
Just leave the report to me!

57
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,389
What happened?

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,899
It was probably an illusion.

59
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,129
Aoi, I'm glad that you're fine.

60
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,279
One-two!

61
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,000
It's quite difficult to pull down.

62
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,680
It's better to be a guard against the vampire disease than to do this.

63
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,019
The vaccine?

64
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,930
I'll go get it latter. And you?

65
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,250
I got it just now, after dinner.

66
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:09,800
Are you OK?

67
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,370
Y-Yes.

68
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,129
Thank you so much. You are?

69
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,060
Sorry. I'm First Lieutenant Shutaro Kurusu from Special Forces Unit 16.

70
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,589
Special Forces?

71
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,100
Never heard of them before.

72
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,110
Why is there smoke on you?

73
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,000
Suspect, take off your cloak!

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,930
This...

75
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,180
Show us your face now!

76
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,839
What?

77
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,199
Vampire.

78
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,459
What happened?

79
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,500
He caught fire and then disappeared.

80
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,720
Where should I go?

81
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,839
The time I can spend with my friends

82
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,750
is becoming less and less.

83
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,610
How I wish to see them all.

84
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:44,570
The ghost lantern?

85
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,879
Excuse me. Is there anything I can help you with?

86
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,509
I'm Kurusu. Mr. Yamagami helped me out a lot in the army.

87
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,220
Ah, welcome here.

88
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:20,850
I'm worried that if you were hurt in this earthquake.

89
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,960
Many thanks.

90
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,679
Compared to what happened to my neighbors, nothing serious here.

91
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,259
That's great.

92
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,480
My husband's friends are all so kind and gentle.

93
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,519
Friends?

94
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,490
Has anyone else come?

95
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,149
One night about ten days after the earthquake,

96
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:49,250
a very tall soldier stood at the door for a moment.

97
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,460
Very tall.

98
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,179
What's his name and which battalion is he from?

99
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,539
I don't know.

100
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,730
But, he was wearing the same uniform as yours.

101
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,909
His hat was so low that I couldn't see his face clearly.

102
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:13,379
However, he has left this stuff here.

103
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,100
It was used by my husband.

104
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:23,779
What was my husband like in the army?

105
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:36,559
Mr. Yamagami was kind of a dandy and always cared about his looks.

106
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,200
I was always scolded by him.

107
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,419
However, he was also a very enthusiastic and gentle man.

108
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,190
He was indeed a man like that.

109
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,460
How efficient you are.

110
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:23,110
You work overwhelmingly faster than I do.

111
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,730
Is it the modern mass production?

112
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,940
The manufacture is the top priority in Koishikawa right now,

113
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,250
because the government also cares much about the case of vampires,

114
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:39,250
it tampered a little with the manufacture.

115
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,379
That's also what you've expected, isn't it?

116
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,639
Only that earthquake was out of my expectation.

117
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,809
People who want the vampire vaccine, come this way.

118
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,299
Mother, can I drink it now?

119
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:09,519
Drink it after we get home.

120
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,409
It is said that the dyehouse family became vampires, too.

121
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,659
How scary.

122
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,309
Showtime.

123
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:01,330
Help.

124
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,600
On the roof?

125
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,070
Ayame!

126
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,519
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

127
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,529
Vampire?

128
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:22,769
Are you OK?

129
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:23,960
Yes.

130
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,440
Vampires, you...

131
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,080
It's useless to talk with them.

132
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,799
They've gone insane.

133
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,779
Everyone became like this after drinking the vaccine.

134
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,970
Why did you...

135
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,679
Help!

136
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,340
Stay away from us!

137
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:48,960
Scary.

138
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,889
We're a little afraid of you.

139
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,190
Sorry. I won't hurt you, I promise.

140
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,929
I understand. But it just feels like...

141
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,549
I'll explain it to you later.

142
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,419
If you stay with me, they probably won't come and attack.

143
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,309
Now, let's go.

144
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,009
Yes.

145
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,960
Boss. Boss of Code Zero.

146
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,779
Tenmanya!

147
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,129
Let's talk later. Come this way.

148
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,169
We're safe now. That guy is our friend.

149
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,809
I heard that there were vampire children in Kanda,

150
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,320
so I came with the shopkeeper to have a look.

151
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,679
Then I heard the screams.

152
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,600
I see.

153
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,690
I happened to be here when the earthquake happened,

154
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,269
being safe and unhurt.

155
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,110
Is the shop ahead?

156
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,840
Yes. If we say the entrance of that house is a front,

157
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,159
this side of the shop here is totally hidden.

158
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,389
We hide the vampires who have lost their homes here.

159
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,940
Boss, what happened to you?

160
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,220
I also want to know.

161
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,190
I know nothing after I was washed away in the earthquake.

162
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,440
What are those guys covered from head to toe?

163
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:47,320
The Kongo Iron Soldiers.

164
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,620
They are artificial vampires made by Nakajima.

165
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,009
Artificial?

166
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,190
They are made from the Moon Blood I showed you before.

167
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,659
Isn't it the inferior blood for vampires?

168
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,940
But Nakajima said that he turned the Special Forces into vampires with it.

169
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,210
I see. Then it makes sense.

170
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,389
Evidence matters more than reason.

171
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,990
Let me show you the inside.

172
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,289
Come, children. I'll give some blood to you.

173
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,669
I'm thirsty.

174
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:23,360
Welcome to Tenmanya.

175
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,799
This is the currently widespread vaccine for the vampire disease.

176
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,509
I drank this. You too, right?

177
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,509
Yes.

178
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:52,340
Does it mean that...?

179
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,440
I suddenly felt thirsty after I drank it.

180
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,180
The kids with us were burnt away by the sun when morning came.

181
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,950
Yo being sick in turn saved me from being burnt.

182
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,730
How did you get blood?

183
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,710
From mice. Though it was not so tasty. Ayame taught me that.

184
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,599
What a clever girl.

185
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,559
There's someone who was very kind to me,

186
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,579
but his eyes have also turned red.

187
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,450
You're too young to suffer this.

188
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,880
Aren't you still a child, too?

189
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,069
You little girl speaks well.

190
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,819
Shopkeeper, please take them to have dinner.

191
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,369
Come this way.

192
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,740
But I don't feel hungry.

193
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,680
To have dinner means to drink blood.

194
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:52,950
Don't worry.

195
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:54,690
I see.

196
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,720
What will happen to the children?

197
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,240
They have to be strong enough to survive.

198
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,859
By the way, about those Code Zero members that you want to know,

199
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:09,410
there's still no credible source.

200
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:12,049
I see.

201
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,130
But, here you can collect all information about vampires.

202
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,210
And, vampires are customers here.

203
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,650
Welcome.

204
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,380
Thank you.

205
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,890
But won't it be troublesome to you?

206
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,250
In the current situation, we need to help each other, Boss of Code Zero.

207
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,519
I want you to find one thing for me.

208
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,202
(MANSEIBASHI)

209
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:43,440
Shopkeeper, where are we?

210
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,339
The construction site of the subway.

211
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:50,039
It's a good thing that it only has a one-way rail built.

212
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,410
It should be some time before it is put into operation.

213
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:53,809
Subway.

214
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,170
Is it also connected to Tsukishima?

215
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,230
What are we looking for here?

216
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,529
Do you still remember that in our shop in Asakusa,

217
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,039
Master once mentioned the household register?

218
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,759
It's managed by Tenmanya, right?

219
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,839
Vampires who can't find a place to live

220
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,619
or adapt themselves to the new life

221
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:26,980
have to hide somewhere they can avoid being noticed.

222
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,799
To help these vampires,

223
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,230
Tenmanya offers them food regularly.

224
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,349
So many!

225
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,759
Hope that they haven't been replaced by the vaccine.

226
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:45,390
It seems they haven't.

227
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:48,480
Yes.

228
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,470
There are too many left.

229
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,539
What's wrong?

230
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,809
We seem to have been trapped by the enemy.

231
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,450
The Kongo Iron Soldiers!

232
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:11,859
Oh? We have an unexpected big boss.

233
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,940
Everyone, it's me, Shutaro Kurusu!

234
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,009
Aren't we teammates?

235
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:25,170
After all, I'm the shopkeeper of Tanmanya.

236
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,420
I won't let you hurt my important guest.

237
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:39,259
Can't you hear what I said?

238
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:17,470
The sun will come out soon. It's time now.

239
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,400
Yes.

240
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:25,839
Danny Boy, what are you doing?

241
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,099
Bad boy.

242
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:39,490
Bad boys must be punished, right?

243
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:43,529
Finally we made it.

244
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,269
I'm going to tell Master first.

245
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,819
My friends, where are you now?

246
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:39,930
(Doubts)
