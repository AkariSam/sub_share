00:00:01,025 --> 00:00:03,025
THIS ANIMATION IS A FICTION BASED ON ITS ERA.
ALL CHARACTERS, GROUPS, LAWS, NAMES AND SO ON ARE FICTIONAL.

2
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,539
What's this big task you're talking about?

3
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,859
It's not a task.

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,519
But I'm told it's a direct message from Lieutenant General Nakajima.

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,559
What's that?

6
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,100
He wants me to marry his daughter.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,076
What?

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,700
That's it.

9
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,200
What...

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,079
Idiot.

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,549
That kind of sad face is not suitable for this happy thing.

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,039
Come on! Cheers!

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,880
Tell me all about that.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,020
That's so nice.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,299
Watch out, Yamagami.

16
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,350
Listen to me everyone,

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,619
This man, whose heart is like a fortress,

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,159
is finally gonna get married!

19
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,880
Stop it! It's so embarrassing.

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,230
Misaki.

21
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,290
I've come to greet you.

22
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:47,064
What Is Your Name, Weakling?

23
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,152
It was hard work.

24
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,719
I'm used to it.

25
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,949
I'm glad to know more about you.

26
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,740
And I want to know more.

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,020
No worries, we've got time.

28
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,180
General.

29
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,909
What's up? It's not like you.

30
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,280
Nothing···

31
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,560
Father, we have a guest.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,099
Lieutenant General, I'm here to pick you up.

33
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,520
Isn't it colonel Maeda?

34
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,569
Are you playing chess together?

35
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,110
Moriyama, you talk too much.

36
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,830
Haha, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,139
Lieutenant General, we gotta hurry up.

38
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,520
Oh, yeah.

39
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,500
I'll be with you.

40
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,750
I'm just going to listen to the grumbling of Okimura, no company needed.

41
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,699
Why don't you just stay and take a rest.

42
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,909
And Misaki will also be happy.

43
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,979
"How good it is to see the moon.

44
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:19,459
She is like a little piece of money.

45
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,759
You would think she was a little silver flower.

46
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,660
She is cold and chaste.

47
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,879
I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty.

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,459
Who is that voice?

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,470
A prophet. Even kings fear him.

50
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,120
He will never fade away.

51
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:43,250
Voices and voices. Words and words.

52
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,839
Tongue and tongue···

53
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:49,439
The desire to kiss that man's mouth with mine."

54
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,560
And then we will attack here and here.

55
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,730
I see.

56
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,279
We're starting to spread out.

57
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,120
Ah.

58
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,970
What's up?

59
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:31,839
Here.

60
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,779
This is a huge area.

61
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,319
Yeah.

62
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,680
Kurusu can really endure.

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,639
And a lot of the little ones are moving.

64
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,199
It seems all the King Kong Troop is assembled.

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,930
It's as if they've all been chasing Lieutenant Colonel Maeda.

66
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,009
Why?

67
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,769
Some kind of dream, maybe?

68
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,689
There's something, even I, cannot understand.

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,160
Things you don't understand?

70
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,420
Uh?

71
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,660
You guys are amazing.

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
You even got the position of the King Kong Troop.

73
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,220
Amazing?

74
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,920
He said we were amazing.

75
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,470
Just a little bit more push,

76
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,540
It's a victory for us if the ghosts don't catch us before the sunrise.

77
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll lead the way.

78
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Thanks!

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,459
Shutaro…

80
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,360
Mr. Maeda.

81
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,079
Vampires!

82
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,430
You have two options:

83
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,180
Option one, follow the order of the 16th Special Agent Team,

84
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,180
And you'll get your blood supply and your registry!

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,550
Option two, if you don't comply···

86
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,139
Mr. Maeda··· Do you really···

87
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,660
Mr. Maeda!

88
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,100
You don't··· you don't even know me anymore?

89
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,879
Only two new guys?

90
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:55,560
One came in the same time as me.

91
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,560
He was sent to England.

92
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, Mr. Yamagami.

93
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,276
He's lucky to be a vampire.

94
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:06,879
Except that fool isn't in the ranking.

95
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,120
We can't use that trash.

96
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,569
Even trash can be used in recycling. Let's see how we can use him.

97
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,980
And the other guy?

98
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,199
Shutaro Kurusu, he is an A-class vampire.

99
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:17,019
This is so great.

100
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,540
A Class,

101
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,519
this is a rarity in this country.

102
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,519
We are on the lucky side.

103
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,810
It's all about how to train him.

104
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,240
Oh?

105
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,420
You look so happy, Mr. Maeda.

106
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,419
Me?

107
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,740
Yes.

108
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,870
What are you talking about···

109
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,080
Mr. Maeda!

110
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,960
Vampire...

111
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,620
I was hoping you could teach me more.

112
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Am I the only one alive?

113
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,919
Even the sun falls, the stars stay.

114
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,019
I know nothing about surviving except fighting.

115
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,440
I am Yoshinobu Maeda!

116
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,799
I owe my life to you, Colonel Nakajima.

117
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,179
Use it however you want!

118
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,509
Not to mention the that. It's so good to see you're alive.

119
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,100
I'm not gonna leave you alone again.

120
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,240
You're awake.

121
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,240
Yeah.

122
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,320
What's up?

123
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,919
You had a nightmare.

124
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,899
I had a strange dream.

125
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,620
It's about paying visit to graves.

126
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,419
There's a tomb of Moriyama.

127
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,220
Is he a member of Code Zero?

128
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,740
Yes.

129
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,480
And one of the graves on the hill

130
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,559
was yours…

131
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,779
I was all alone...

132
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,700
What a strange dream···

133
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,139
Where should I go?

134
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,620
Why not just take me along…

135
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,559
Shutaro!

136
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,360
Misaki.

137
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,320
What are you doing here!

138
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,059
Because you left without saying anything!

139
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,399
Please do not come here!

140
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,639
Aoi, you need to find someplace where the sun shines.

141
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,659
The place where we can't reach.

142
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,299
Shutaro.

143
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,139
I am···

144
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:47,590
Mr. Maeda.

145
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,850
Wake up!

146
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,679
I am···

147
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,220
Kurusu...

148
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,879
Kurusu...

149
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,299
Mr. Maeda?

150
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,700
Kurusu...

151
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,470
Your naivety will get your friends killed.

152
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,960
I am.. naive.

153
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,639
But what is wrong with innocence?

154
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,990
Innocence···

155
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,659
Isn't that what humans should be like?

156
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,379
Mr. Maeda!

157
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,860
To future kids:

158
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,720
Witness these angry words.

159
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,375
Don't forget.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,100
In the ancient days,

161
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,620
There was a brand of immorality in sweet love.

162
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,019
In the golden age of the stars,

163
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,419
we were liberated from the harsh winter.

164
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,210
Our young bodies bathed in the holy light.

165
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,100
They wore nothing, bequeathed of the grace of the light.

166
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:42,379
The warmth filled the heart of the young boy and the young girl.

167
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,840
The two young souls combined as one,

168
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,159
in the glorious house,

169
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,159
in the glorious house that holy light shined through.

170
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,480
A place where the holy light removed the darkness of night.

171
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,399
The sun will rise.

172
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,360
Two young men played on the green grassland.

173
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,120
Their parents knew nothing.

174
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,919
The ones who knew what's happening would not get close.

175
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,039
The innocent maiden knew nothing of fear.

176
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,159
The taste of kissing lips were sweet no more.

177
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:22,860
The two made a promise to meet again.

178
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,879
The sullen sky

179
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,299
was finally trapped by the silent drowsiness.

180
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,220
Kurusu...

181
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,620
Mr. Maeda?

182
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,340
You're still... so innocent.

183
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,000
Mr. Maeda!

184
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,759
PFC Kurusu!

185
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,509
Yes sir!

186
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,960
This stupid drama

187
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:05,779
can stop now.

188
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,360
Please.

189
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,279
Mr. Maeda...

190
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:28,019
I am... not alone.

191
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,620
Lieutenant Colonel Yoshinobu Maeda,

192
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,759
your mission is completed now.

193
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,250
Shutaro.

194
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,440
Is it over?

195
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:10,680
Yeah.

196
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,940
You don't need to fight anymore?

197
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,039
I have to.

198
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,579
Blood...

199
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:35,440
I would have died if I am not a vampire.

200
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,759
Idiot.

201
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,450
Aoi.

202
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:46,200
What's up?

203
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,720
Can you give me some blood?

204
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,839
What?

205
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,829
I hope you can turn me into a real vampire.

206
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,059
Please.

207
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,930
I hope you can just be a human.

208
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,299
Aoi?

209
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,799
Be a human, Shutaro!

210
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,638
That's why, Aoi…

211
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,500
Shutaro?

212
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,440
Whatever I am, vampire or human,

213
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,720
in order to keep my humanity, I choose to fight.

214
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:18,900
Shutaro!

215
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,319
Wow, that's amazing.

216
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:32,500
Kurusu...

217
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:33,880
Kurusu...

218
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:35,079
This is...

219
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,400
Who… are you?

220
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,000
I am Shutaro Kurusu.

221
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,759
Ten years, twenty years or thirty years later,

222
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,220
are you still Shutaro?

223
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,720
I would be a granny then.

224
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,539
All of a sudden, the show ended.

225
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,079
In the gap between reality and virtuality,

226
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,339
there was

227
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,539
our home.

228
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,559
The weak, your name is

229
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,079
vampire.

230
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,700
Vampires!

231
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:56,859
You have two options:

232
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:01,200
Option one, follow the order of the 16th Special Agent Team.

233
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
And you'll get your blood supply and your registry!

234
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,140
Option two, if you don't comply,

235
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,599
all of you will be killed!

236
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,619
Everyone is an actor.

237
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,299
The world is like a stage.

238
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,880
There's entry and exit.

239
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,569
Everyone plays his or her part.

240
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,240
And then leave.

241
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:31,599
But,

242
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:35,299
we are never on the stage.
