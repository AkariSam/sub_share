1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,044
THIS ANIMATION IS A FICTION BASED ON ITS ERA.
ALL CHARACTERS, GROUPS, LAWS, NAMES AND SO ON ARE FICTIONAL.

2
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,787
Show me the real thing.

3
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:53,614
But…

4
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,566
Is it because I'm human?

5
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:57,992
Yes…

6
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,311
That kind of naivete will get your comrades hurt.

7
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,169
Let's go.

8
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,515
Watch.

9
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,687
Even in your human form you can't beat me.

10
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,070
Lieutenant Colonel Maeda.

11
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:36,375
A suspicious body has been discovered in Yoshiwara.

12
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,611
They were killed by a vampire.

13
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,991
I'll go immediately.

14
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,486
The sun is rising. Don't go anywhere until evening.

15
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,632
The Song Unsung

16
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,310
Chouyarou… it's a pretty big geisha house in Yoshiwara.

17
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,550
This geisha's name is Otama.

18
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,375
She has been missing for two days.

19
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,816
When they saw how she had been killed, they contacted us.

20
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,265
Send our agents in. Thoroughly search the area.

21
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,849
Send Code Zero in tonight.

22
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,015
The report on the Yoshiwara poisoner isn't here!

23
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:31,211
Chief!

24
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,298
Our readers are modern girls who are interested in fashion.

25
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,699
And a dead geisha is not such a rare thing.

26
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:40,594
But, it could be an underground romance

27
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:43,306
or some kind of forbidden love affair!

28
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,500
Actually, that article was vetoed by people up top.

29
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,062
Up top?

30
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,787
It was the military, alright?

31
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:52,171
I don't want to get in trouble with them.

32
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,400
But…(homophone of "democracy")

33
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,318
But what? We've already had enough of the democracy movement.

34
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:57,111
Let's get back to work.

35
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,332
I want you to go to the Imperial Hotel.

36
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,907
The one designed by Frank Lloyd Wright?

37
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:05,960
I heard that an exclusive English perfume shop wants a promotion.

38
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,039
at the hotel completion ceremony in September.

39
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,300
Then, can I ask you something?

40
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:13,127
What?

41
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,337
If I want to eat roast beef at the Imperial hotel

42
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:16,630
can it come out of our budget?

43
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:18,665
Idiot.

44
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,387
That incident in Yoshiwara…

45
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,165
It's been dealt with.

46
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,266
Thank you for your assistance.

47
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,144
It's nothing… I can only do this small thing to help.

48
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,023
I know about the budgeting issue.

49
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,399
My deepest apologies.

50
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,665
I wonder when it will begin…

51
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:41,947
Starting next year, the budget will be halved.

52
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,240
From then on we won't even be able to

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,744
provide a decent meal for those kids.

54
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:50,081
The Elite Unit project is the most costly,

55
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:52,250
we have no choice but to suspend it.

56
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,461
It's unfortunate.

57
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,047
The Elite Unit won't be the only ones who are affected,

58
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,353
we expect to reduce our numbers

59
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:02,093
by 100,000 across the military.

60
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,600
Not including the intelligence agency, you mean?

61
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,583
Think of this year as your deadline.

62
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,812
If the 16th Special Agent Team can't produce some exceptional results

63
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,466
by the end of the year, it will be disbanded.

64
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,937
It's really unfortunate.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,836
This is Yoshiwara?

66
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,541
Ever since the Edo period, if you're looking for pleasure,

67
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:26,192
this is the right place.

68
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:27,562
Huh.

69
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:30,185
Mr. Suwa,

70
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,435
We're supposed to infiltrate this place.

71
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:32,884
Don't you think you'll attract attention dressing like that?

72
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:34,925
It's normal to dress like this here.

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,245
This place is a long way from the normal world.

74
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,899
Captain, have you decided which one to infiltrate?

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,584
It will be Chouyarou.

76
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:46,132
Our job is to go inside and root out the vampire.

77
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:48,600
But… how are we supposed to find it?

78
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:49,350
Huh?

79
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:52,050
I don't know how to tell if someone is a vampire.

80
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,536
What…what the heck are you saying?

81
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:59,875
Ah, I see… Because Kurusu is Japan's most powerful vampire.

82
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,449
What do you mean?

83
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:05,750
Yamagami can recognize that we're vampires, right?

84
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:06,815
And why is that?

85
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:08,550
Because of fear.

86
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,000
That's right.

87
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,327
Because you instinctively fear those who are stronger than you.

88
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:17,952
So, Yamagami, you take the lead in the vampire hunt, alright?

89
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:22,206
Only the weakest of us can do it.

90
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,733
It's a good thing Yamagami is a low-ranking vampire.

91
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,795
That's great, Yamagami!

92
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,357
Ah, what's wrong?

93
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:32,509
I've had enough of you guys!

94
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,084
Run along, Yamagami, that way.

95
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,805
Even you order me around like a dog.

96
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,399
I get it, I'll go.

97
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:42,625
But, vampires won't attack other vampires, right?

98
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,541
Says who?

99
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,656
Huh?

100
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,713
To a high-level vampire, a human-like vampire like you

101
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,341
would be a delicacy.

102
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,141
Is this how you all see me?

103
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,713
It's just a joke. We wouldn't eat one of our own kind.

104
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:58,071
Who would want to eat an idiot like you?

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,357
It'll be fine. Yamagami is one of us!

106
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,331
We wouldn't let you become a meal for other vampires.

107
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,571
Why do I feel as if it's more dangerous to stay here?

108
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,367
If there are any problems, use the ultrasonic wave

109
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:10,672
to contact us like we taught you.

110
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,084
Ah…

111
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:14,884
Like this?

112
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:16,595
That's right.

113
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:17,541
Hurry up!

114
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,685
What are you guys playing at? Let's go.

115
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,980
Here it is… I'm finally at the Imperial Hotel!

116
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,071
It's amazing! Oh.

117
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:33,014
Yes. It has arrived at Yokohama from England, just as planned.

118
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,363
We've prepared the highest-quality products for you.

119
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:38,824
Good. We are closer to making my vision a reality.

120
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,266
Keep up the good work.

121
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:45,500
No matter what you need, I, Rufus Glenn, am at your service.

122
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:49,314
That man… Where have I seen him before?

123
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:53,923
Hey, you.

124
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,742
Huh?

125
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,514
This is no place for children.

126
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,985
Or did you sneak in here for some pocket money?

127
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:06,028
Don't speak to me like that. I'm a newspaper reporter.

128
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:09,105
Newspaper? Are you the one who is going to advertise for us?

129
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,742
Then, who are you?

130
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,800
I am Aoi Shirase from Capital News.

131
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,072
Then, by all means, do as you please.

132
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,242
What's this?

133
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,127
An exquisite perfume.

134
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:23,704
But I suppose you won't be able to appreciate its beauty.

135
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:28,257
If you could, it would mean that this country is ready for a change,

136
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,857
to become the place I envision, a nation of beauty.

137
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,841
How is the content analysis going?

138
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,870
It seems like the V toxin poison has been added to it.

139
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:39,802
Poison?

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,714
If used on vampires, it causes them to lose control.

141
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,799
We still don't know what happens if it enters the human body.

142
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,942
Would you like to try, Captain?

143
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:52,586
That won't be necessary. I believe that similar

144
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:53,985
experiments are already underway here.

145
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,115
Mr. Takeuchi, we have arrived at Chouyarou.

146
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:59,542
Understood. Be careful in there.

147
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:01,582
We're ready to start the infiltration.

148
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:03,413
Okay, let's begin.

149
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:15,000
My name is Akesato.

150
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,727
Please take good care of me.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,722
Would you like me to prepare a pipe for you?

152
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:26,224
No.

153
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,244
Then, would you like to play a game?

154
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,226
How about Tiger, Tiger, Tiger?

155
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:30,687
No.

156
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,171
Then… how about singing?

157
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,085
Sorry, I don't know any songs.

158
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,527
Then, what would you like me do?

159
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:55,085
You can just take it easy.

160
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,515
You're cute. How old are you?

161
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:01,100
300 years old.

162
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:04,615
So you're that vampire everyone is talking about?

163
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:05,727
That's right.

164
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:08,227
You're a cute vampire…

165
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,471
How old are you?

166
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,413
15 years old.

167
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,966
Ah, you're from the Taisho era? Those are always so hard to deal with.

168
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:19,057
Aren't you also from the Taisho era, sir?

169
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:21,403
Me? From the Taisho era? Give me a break.

170
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,157
Do I look like I'm the kind of person

171
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:23,985
who is obsessed with the West?

172
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,014
You're an interesting man.

173
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,912
Becoming a geisha at your age…

174
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,157
it seems like you're doing it more decently than other girls.

175
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,942
It is difficult?

176
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,057
I'm used to it. What about you, sir?

177
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:41,832
The outside world is full of people who are like vampires.

178
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,970
This is the only place for me.

179
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,740
When I was your age

180
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:51,475
my blood was sucked dry by many vampires.

181
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:55,283
How old are you really?

182
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,231
I already told you that I'm 300 years old.

183
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,649
Then, let me give you this, sir.

184
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,653
My hairpin.

185
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:04,780
What would I do with something like that?

186
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,116
You need to come back and return it to me next time.

187
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,619
I can't make a promise like that to you.

188
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,370
This is a geisha house.

189
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,916
You have to reply "yes", even if it's a lie.

190
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,299
Okay.

191
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:22,784
I'm really lucky to have your solicitude.

192
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,259
Hey, give that back!

193
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:26,802
No…

194
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,513
You'll lose consciousness!

195
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,384
She's sleeping?

196
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,452
If I could sing, perhaps I could stay a little longer.

197
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:55,373
Yamagami found a vampire!

198
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:56,332
Oh!

199
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,461
Sweet dreams.

200
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,774
With this many vampires working together,

201
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:10,033
how did you still allow the target to get away?

202
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,316
Even with the A-class members there! How did this happen?

203
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,642
Our deepest apologies.

204
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:17,729
But, how did the vampire know that we were there?

205
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:20,105
It must be because of Kurusu.

206
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,106
My deepest apologies!

207
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:24,443
In that case, next time Yamagami shall go in alone.

208
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:26,403
Are you trying to get me killed?

209
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:30,124
We entered that tempura shop together,

210
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,326
where the heck did you go after?

211
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:33,953
While you were failing to apprehend the vampire,

212
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:37,123
we received a report of another victim.

213
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:41,669
A guest of Yoshiwara and a geisha were found dead.

214
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,297
Takeuchi, have you finished examining the body?

215
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:48,200
Yes, the discoloration of the body has progressed as expected.

216
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,096
But there was something unusual.

217
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,179
What?

218
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:57,851
The teeth marks on the deceased are not the same size.

219
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,653
Huh?

220
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,133
A body was found in a ditch in the east area.

221
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,082
It has already been sent to Tsukishima.

222
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:14,952
The teeth marks?

223
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,745
They are not consistent with either of the previous cases.

224
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,541
Understood. Keep searching.

225
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:20,582
Yes, sir!

226
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:27,200
That brings us to six incidents in total around Yoshiwara.

227
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,509
Judging from the teeth marks, it's a new vampire.

228
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:33,562
It seems that the fugitive vampire has some new accomplices.

229
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,813
There are too many.

230
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:36,725
So, you're a soldier.

231
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,811
Ah, it's you. What is a reporter doing around here?

232
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:41,860
I'm looking into the mysterious deaths.

233
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,057
But why are the military investigating, not the police?

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,778
That's classified information. I have no obligation to disclose it.

235
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,100
Lieutenant Colonel Maeda. We found the vampire's trail.

236
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,451
Okay, I'll go over right away.

237
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,232
Lieutenant Colonel Maeda… so he's an important official…

238
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,961
I didn't know that vampires like Yoshiwara so much.

239
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:07,004
It seems like they're using here as their base camp.

240
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:08,840
Mhm, seems like it.

241
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,265
Mr. Yamagami, do your best!

242
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:12,225
I know.

243
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,750
Ah!

244
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,615
I need to produce the sound from my stomach, right?

245
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:18,975
It's an ultrasonic wave.

246
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,682
I know…

247
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:26,659
What is Suwa doing?

248
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,817
He seems to have already sneaked in.

249
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,903
I never imagined this would turn into

250
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,366
a search for a vampire in Yoshiwara.

251
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:41,206
What's going on with that geisha?

252
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,207
Barefoot and wobbling…

253
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,876
Could she be a vampire?

254
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:47,586
Oh!

255
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:48,799
That one, too?

256
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:00,682
There are so many!

257
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,783
Ah! This is Yamagami.

258
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,865
I have sighted vampires! Requesting backup!

259
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:08,732
Can they hear me? Damn it!

260
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:10,777
She's not here?

261
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,580
She wasn't feeling well, she's been resting for the past few days.

262
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,500
We haven't seen any sign of her since last night.

263
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:19,159
I see…

264
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:23,500
Sir, we have many better girls than Akesato.

265
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,450
Just as cute as me.

266
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,208
No thanks.

267
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,797
Has Yamagami contacted you?

268
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,950
Not yet.

269
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,033
No.

270
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:38,033
Could it be… Yamagami doesn't know how use the ultrasonic wave?

271
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:42,100
And he is still tracking them but cannot reach us?

272
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,268
That idiot!

273
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,979
Don't you think that it's rude?

274
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:48,179
You say that Maeda is a soldier.

275
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,779
It's his job, what can he do?

276
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:55,238
I also heard that Yoshiwara is no place for a young girl to go alone.

277
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,198
It's okay! I'm chasing a story.

278
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,299
But, is it really okay for you to hang around a place like that?

279
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:05,284
It's fine. Our editor doesn't listen to me anyway.

280
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:07,035
It's just like before. Even though I was busy

281
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:07,799
tracking that mysterious death in Yoshiwara,

282
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,125
he ordered me to go to the Imperial Hotel

283
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,128
to get some material for him.

284
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,515
Why are you making that face?

285
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:18,260
I suddenly remembered. That rude man named Rufus…

286
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:20,820
How could this kind of perfume become popular?

287
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,466
It doesn't even smell that good.

288
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:29,813
Yeah, it's too sweet.

289
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,484
My nose is burning, I can't smell it.

290
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,361
Can I keep this? Please.

291
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:39,657
Sure. I don't really like it anyway.

292
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:40,825
Thank you.

293
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,883
I see.

294
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,671
This is Yamagami! I have spotted the vampire! The vampire!

295
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:56,841
No response…

296
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:02,013
Fellow vampires,

297
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:04,766
right now, you have two options.

298
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,310
One, comply with us, the 16th Special Agent Team,

299
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,563
and we will guarantee your blood supply.

300
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,849
Hey, are you listening to me?

301
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,182
Oi! If you are listening, can't you respond a little?

302
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,155
These guys, can none of them speak?

303
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,326
Stay back! This is one of the newest gun models!

304
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,180
Even vampires can be harmed by it.

305
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:29,665
Ugh!

306
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,086
Stop it! Stop biting my arm!

307
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,880
Low-ranking vamprie blood is very bitter!

308
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,214
Don't bite me!

309
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,970
Yamagami?

310
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:42,720
What's wrong?

311
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,181
Although it's very weak, I can hear his voice!

312
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:45,765
I'm going!

313
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,473
Kurusu!

314
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:51,895
I believe that's the place to bury geishas who died from illness.

315
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,316
Who would go to a place like that?

316
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:56,984
Get to the temple, fast!

317
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,079
And let Suwa know too!

318
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,660
Mr. Maeda.

319
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,160
What?

320
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:01,950
Look.

321
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:09,372
the 16th Special Agent Team! Block off Yoshiwara!

322
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:12,959
Major Yamagami!

323
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:13,542
Huh?

324
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,044
You're all vampires?

325
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,684
Yamagami! Are you okay?

326
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:21,467
Kurusu, you're too late.

327
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,886
I'm almost out of blood

328
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:26,982
Get away from Yamagami!

329
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,316
"That kind of naivete will get your comrades hurt."

330
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,193
Stop!

331
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,250
Did I do this?

332
00:18:58,365 --> 00:18:59,950
You're too late.

333
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,279
If I had died, what would you do?

334
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,844
I will be faster next time!

335
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:16,064
Kurusu, you are amazing.

336
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,799
Akesato.

337
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,883
Uh…

338
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,598
I want to give this back to you.

339
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:59,398
Sir…sing for me…

340
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,655
I really don't know any songs…

341
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,826
How gentle…

342
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:26,467
Suwa, what are you doing in a place like this?

343
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:30,805
Oh, she's so young. How unfortunate.

344
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:32,472
Hey, Takeuchi…

345
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:33,348
What?

346
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:42,858
If you know any songs, can you teach me some?

347
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,412
Lieutenant Colonel Maeda! Yamagami is alive!

348
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,248
Kurusu saved me.

349
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:58,680
Kurusu did all this?

350
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:00,759
I gave it my best shot.

351
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,503
…Is that right?

352
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,173
…What is it?

353
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:07,467
Nothing.

354
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:16,642
Didn't you make a deal not to hunt me in Tokyo?

355
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,936
I'll let my masters know.

356
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,482
I just want to spend the night in peace.

357
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:31,574
I see, so that's how…

358
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,700
What?

359
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:35,827
It looks like it came in through this barrel of alcohol.

360
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,288
Where did it come from?

361
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:39,123
Alcohol, huh?

362
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,579
That smell. It's Scotch whiskey.

363
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,039
It's from England then.

364
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,914
It's odd that a place like this

365
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,619
would have this kind of English whiskey.

366
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:53,099
Let the Elite Unit follow up on it right away!

367
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:58,279
Maeda, sir?

368
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,185
Maeda.

369
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:02,771
Maeda!

370
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:40,086
Persona Non Grata
