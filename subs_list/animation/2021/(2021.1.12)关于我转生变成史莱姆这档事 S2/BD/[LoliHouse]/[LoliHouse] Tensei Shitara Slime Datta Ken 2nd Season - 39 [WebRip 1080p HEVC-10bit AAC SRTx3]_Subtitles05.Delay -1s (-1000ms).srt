1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:02,648
Well then, let's move on to the main topic.

2
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,297
Ramiris?!

3
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:11,188
What's up all of the sudden?

4
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:14,249
I heard all about it!

5
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:17,867
This country, Tempest, will be destroyed!

6
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:19,188
Wha--

7
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:22,813
What did you say?!

8
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:24,211
Yes, destro--

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,008
H-Hey! What are you doing?!

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,875
I can't break free even with all my power!

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,383
Great Rimuru, how would you like me to dispose of this pesky insect?

12
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,828
What? What is it with you?!

13
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:40,625
That thing is more or less a Demon Lord, though.

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,625
Y-You're not just some ordinary guy, are you?!

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,883
Umm, Mr. Rimuru...

16
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:47,491
Who is that spirit...?

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,421
Well, she's Ramiris, my acquaintance.

18
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:53,148
She might not look the part, but she's apparently a Demon Lord.

19
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:55,656
Demon Lord...

20
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,016
Despite how I look,

21
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,937
I'm actually revered as the strongest of the Ten Great Demon Lords!

22
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:01,102
Oooh?

23
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,867
Hey, you. Why aren't you more surprised?

24
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:06,843
I am Ramiris of the Labyrinth, in flesh!

25
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:09,539
How can you be so dry like that?

26
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:13,641
Well, the Storm Dragon's revival is already a big enough surprise for me.

27
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:17,046
I don't think anything could surprise me at this point.

28
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,734
Huh? Storm Dragon?

29
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,758
You're telling me Veldora has been revived?

30
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:28,953
No way! I am the one who beat Veldora in a single punch!

31
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:31,024
He was nothing but all talk.

32
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,994
Besides, his era is over now.

33
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:39,088
What you should fear is me, not that puny "Breeze Dragon"!

34
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,057
-Veldora. -Hmm?

35
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:53,015
Sorry, but can you deal with this kid for me?

36
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:57,643
Veldora?

37
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,323
I'm leaving the rest to you.

38
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:30,346
Fate repeats all over again

39
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:32,721
The voices of my heart say

40
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,562
Time is not enough, it's over

41
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:41,307
Belief that makes me who I am

42
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,666
Light doesn't fade away

43
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:46,510
Made my mind up now, it's better

44
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,995
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

45
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,918
Lured by your hands

46
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:57,502
Even if it rains don't be swayed

47
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,549
Being same as always

48
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,237
Want to feel my destiny

49
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,862
Open my eyes to be braver

50
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:08,064
Get up now Get up now stronger

51
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:10,364
I believe in myself

52
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,590
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

53
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,331
I'll never run away

54
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:20,995
I might lose control

55
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,174
It's a perfect world

56
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,697
Destroy all of it, in the end it's for our good

57
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,877
Let me shout like flames

58
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:39,041
(Episode 39: Ramiris's Report)

59
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:42,237
Well then, once again, let me bring up the main topic.

60
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,467
The narrative we will reveal to the public will be as follows.

61
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:50,179
I will declare myself a Demon Lord, but conceal the fact that I have awakened.

62
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:54,955
The greedy king of Falmuth, Edmaris, led his army towards Tempest,

63
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,698
starting a war, and got defeated as result.

64
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,949
Rather than getting destroyed by a Demon Lord alone,

65
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,996
saying they got defeated in war makes it easier to swallow for other nations.

66
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:11,335
And the fallen Falmuth soldiers unwittingly opened up the dreadful seal,

67
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:15,332
unleashing the sleeping Evil Dragon, the Storm Dragon Veldora.

68
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:19,372
What is it?

69
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:24,097
To oppose Veldora, the Champion Youm and I joined hand.

70
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:28,200
After many losses, we successfully negotiated and calmed his anger.

71
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:32,434
And ended the conflict by agreeing to worship him as our guardian.

72
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:37,402
We will justify my ascend as a Demon Lord, put all the blame on Falmuth Kingdom,

73
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,932
and portray our actions as justice.

74
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,409
Just think about it.

75
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,410
People fear what they do not understand, and will never willfully accept it.

76
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,920
Even if the monster who destroyed an army of 20,000 is standing for peace,

77
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,298
no one would believe it.

78
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:02,212
But if we claim the Storm Dragon is behind those deaths,

79
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,387
the masses will find it easier to grasp.

80
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,038
The Storm Dragon is a 'Catastrophe,' a mastermind of chaos, after all.

81
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,813
You're quite a smart man for calling me a mastermind!

82
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,107
That's not what he meant!

83
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,855
I also support this narrative.

84
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:24,199
Rather than my daughter being resented for causing the birth of a new Demon Lord,

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,368
it's better for her to be credited

86
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:31,382
for introducing a Demon Lord that enabled negotiations with the Storm Dragon.

87
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,417
And that's not the only merit of this.

88
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:40,882
This might also fool other Demon Lords into thinking that Veldora is the only threat.

89
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,468
If so, it'll be easier for me to make my move.

90
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:48,306
Furthermore, if people know that we've got the authority to negotiate with Veldora,

91
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:52,018
it'll keep a lot of nations from trying to mess with us, don't you think?

92
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,312
If anyone is opposed to this, please speak up.

93
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:58,024
Especially Veldora, since I would have you take all the blame for my sins.

94
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,820
There is no problem.

95
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,406
I've decided to share your karma.

96
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,576
So just make use of the name Storm Dragon all you want.

97
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,070
All right. Thank you.

98
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,622
It is understandable!

99
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:17,335
In that case, we can continue negotiating with other nations the same way as before.

100
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,838
Brilliantly done, Great Rimuru.

101
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,506
A truly ingenious plan!

102
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,092
No, it was King Gazel's idea.

103
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,375
I only compile everyone's opinion together.

104
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,973
We thank you, King Gazel.

105
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,802
This means we can expect Sir Rimuru's aid when we make our move.

106
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,189
I see.

107
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,568
So we can simply focus solely on Clayman.

108
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,530
If we lose, then it will just prove that I'm incompetent.

109
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,781
All right.

110
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:50,201
That will be the narrative we're going for my transformation into a Demon Lord.

111
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,881
Everyone agrees?

112
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,251
Well then, with that in mind, I would like to decide on our next move.

113
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,170
Youm.

114
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,116
Huh?

115
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,344
Yes.

116
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:09,471
I would like to support Champion Youm as the new King of Falmuth

117
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:12,474
and build a new nation for its people.

118
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,812
What did you say? Youm will?

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,314
First, we will release King Edmaris,

120
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,859
and force him to pay reparations for invading our country.

121
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,489
But I highly doubt that king will even oblige to pay reparations.

122
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,157
That's the point.

123
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,493
The reparation is merely the trigger.

124
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:36,094
Our real goal is to start a civil war within Falmuth Kingdom.

125
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:40,210
We will destroy and rebuild it as a new nation.

126
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,421
With the Champion Youm as its new king.

127
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,711
Thankfully, he's popular among the citizens.

128
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:47,890
Eeeh?

129
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,181
Very well.

130
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,351
I have no objection in the proposal itself.

131
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,328
Do you have the resolve to feel for your people, shoulder their pain,

132
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,312
and stand before them?!

133
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:21,828
How is it?

134
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:27,624
Hell do I know?

135
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,812
I'm not here to become a king because I want to.

136
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:36,099
But people trust me with this role,

137
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,554
and if I turn it down, how can I call myself a man?

138
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:44,609
I just don't want to tell myself I can't do it and give up before I even try.

139
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,765
And I also want to impress the woman I love.

140
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:51,273
Idiot.

141
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,285
If I'm doing this, I'll give it my all!

142
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,749
This guy is certainly an idiot.

143
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,703
But that's how he does things.

144
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:05,795
Dwarven King, I can guarantee you this.

145
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,672
This guy is undoubtedly an idiot.

146
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,070
Don't call me idiot over and over--

147
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:10,675
But he's not irresponsible.

148
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,970
I promise until the day he can become like a King of Champion such as you,

149
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,307
I, Grucius, will be on his side and watch over him!

150
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,906
So do I!

151
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,094
Very well.

152
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,698
If you need anything, you may rely on me.

153
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:39,120
I must say, you found quite an interesting man here.

154
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,881
Seeing how he seeks the throne to impress the woman he loves.

155
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,297
Nice going, Grucius.

156
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:54,260
I wasn't expecting you to declare betraying Great Carrion like that in front of us.

157
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,131
W-Well, that's not my intention...

158
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:04,980
Youm, what we seek from your nation is agricultural production.

159
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,316
Instead of competing with other nations in a common field,

160
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:12,564
you will find it easier to coexist if you take a dip into the unexplored market.

161
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,740
Count me in on that, too, Youm.

162
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,618
We can discuss the detail later.

163
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,443
Understood, Mister.

164
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,181
Just count on me.

165
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,990
Agriculture is fully developed in Falmuth, I'm sure it will work out.

166
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:30,123
Then as a representative of Blumund, I have a proposal.

167
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,443
Proposal?

168
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:35,426
I feel like we have something to offer in this plan.

169
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,506
Oh?

170
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:42,725
Blumund has an intimate relationship with Marquis Muller and Count Hellman in Falmuth.

171
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:47,834
How about we negotiate with them and have them join our side on this matter?

172
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:53,678
I believe they can provide reliable support when Youm takes his post as a king.

173
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,947
That would be great, but...

174
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:59,826
Even as a Guildmaster, is it really okay for you to decide that here?

175
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,873
Please understand that right now I'm standing here as part of the government.

176
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,791
Not as a Guildmaster,

177
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,953
but as an secretary Supervisor of Blumund's intelligence department.

178
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,966
And you're saying we can trust those nobles?

179
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:19,470
Marquis Muller is actually a distant relative of Blumund royal family.

180
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,974
And Count Hellman owed a great dept of gratitude towards Marquis Muller.

181
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,268
It is unlikely he would betray him.

182
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,728
I see.

183
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,678
But is it really okay for you to reveal that secret right here?

184
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,568
It's okay.

185
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,498
And I'm sure you're well aware of this already.

186
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:42,959
The Spymaster of Dwargon are just as skilled as our intelligence department.

187
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,914
All right, got it.

188
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:52,554
Fuze, can you contact Marquis Muller and Count Hellman for us in secret?

189
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,209
Yeah, just leave it to me.

190
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,217
Youm, you heard him right?

191
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,953
Yeah, you can count on me.

192
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:02,818
Okay, that should be all about Youm and the throne.

193
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,748
Let's make the Champion's triumph as brilliant as it can be!

194
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:24,428
The leaders of nations expressing their minds without doubting one another.

195
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:29,498
I feel like a fool for being on alert with you all.

196
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:32,436
C'mon, Papa.

197
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,841
Allow me to ask you.

198
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:44,568
Do you really trust this monster Rimuru?

199
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,228
What do you mean by that?

200
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,600
Even if monsters band together and decide to start a country,

201
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:58,194
there should be no reason for Blumund to officially recognize them.

202
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,897
Let alone developing the diplomacy with them.

203
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,951
So what I'm saying is this.

204
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,870
If it were me, I would only engage in trade

205
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,038
and see how the Western Holy Church moves.

206
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:15,503
Enjoy all the profit and give them confidential reports.

207
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:19,340
If there's any problem, just leave the matters to them.

208
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:24,154
Isn't that how a small nation usually handle matters?

209
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:32,990
Argh, all right, all right! I understand!

210
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,162
Well then, allow me to be straight with you.

211
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:41,645
Yes, of course, I had the same opinion as you, Archduke Erald.

212
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:47,452
I stated the same to my superior before Mr. Rimuru first arrived at Blumund.

213
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:52,916
But he rejected the idea, fearing the possibility of war.

214
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,004
Build a mutual friendship and find a way to coexist.

215
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:02,133
That was the conclusion the higher-ups in our government made.

216
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,845
A nation such as yours and the Dwarven Kingdom is big and powerful.

217
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,473
So I'm sure you have all sorts of choices available.

218
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:12,935
But for us weak nations, one misstep could speak our doom.

219
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,771
If we're going to entrust our fate to someone,

220
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:20,319
it's better to trust the monster lord than relying on Western Holy Church's help.

221
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:23,108
Anyway, that's basically it.

222
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:27,450
And you came here to save Mister Rimuru.

223
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,660
Was that also the decision of your superior?

224
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,496
Exactly.

225
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:34,624
Since we've ratified a security treaty,

226
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,421
I've been ordered to follow it to the letter.

227
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:43,049
Well, even if the government broke its promise, I would still come here.

228
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,084
I'm a free man.

229
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:50,154
Why did I even take this job?

230
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,229
Anyway, I've been appointed to Blumund's intelligence department.

231
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,356
You can say my luck ran out from that point on.

232
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,650
And that superior of yours is...

233
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:04,014
None other than His Majesty, the King of Blumund himself.

234
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,920
I apologize, Sir Fuze.

235
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:12,123
But thanks to you, I now finally understand Blumund's intentions.

236
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,833
I already trust Rimuru since the start, so there is nothing to doubt.

237
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,709
You may say that Gazel,

238
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,066
but deciding whether to form a pact with a nation of monsters is not that easy.

239
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:28,678
I'm having a new-found respect for King of Blumund.

240
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,389
Hmph, enough with the act.

241
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:34,678
You already made your decision, that's why you're here in the first place.

242
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,701
So, Master Strategist Erald.

243
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,037
What's your conclusion?

244
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:41,023
I have indeed made my own conclusion.

245
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,006
But before I answer you that.

246
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,068
May I ask one more question?

247
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,733
Papa, come on!

248
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:52,678
Stop acting all stuck-up and just answer already!

249
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:55,842
Whoa, Princess, that's not good!

250
00:15:55,867 --> 00:16:00,623
Yeah! Archduke is trying his hardest to look cool for you, okay?!

251
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,764
So much for master strategist.

252
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:14,505
Let me hear it, Erald.

253
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,967
A Demon Lord aura!

254
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:19,725
I see, tremendous indeed.

255
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,899
Well then, Demon Lord Rimuru.

256
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,608
Let me ask you.

257
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:30,154
How do you intent to wield your power as Demon Lord?

258
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,826
Eh?

259
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,785
Really? Just something that easy?

260
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,139
Easy?

261
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,247
The answer is simple.

262
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:42,418
I want to make a world that's easy to live in as I pictured.

263
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:47,028
A bountiful world where as many people as possible can be content with.

264
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:52,326
You really think you can make such a fantasy-like dream come true?

265
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,333
That's what this power is for.

266
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,170
An ideal with no power to back it up is nonsense,

267
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:59,311
and a power without ideals are pointless, right?

268
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,863
Hilarious!

269
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:08,660
This is hilarious, Demon Lord Rimuru!

270
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,113
'O Demon Lord versed in karma.

271
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:15,451
I think I now understand why you managed to awaken yourself.

272
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,876
My pardons, Demon Lord Rimuru.

273
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:24,585
As the envoy of the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion,

274
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:29,478
I hereby request the establishment of formal relations with Jura Tempest Federation.

275
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:33,720
I hope to hear a positive reply from you.

276
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:34,900
Papa!

277
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,259
-P-Princess! -Wait!

278
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,181
I was also hoping to build a positive relationship with you.

279
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,579
I will gladly accept the offer.

280
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:25,335
Thus, Tempest successfully established a relation with Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

281
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:30,587
After Blumund and Dwargon, that makes it our third allied human nation.

282
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,642
-Okay, Benimaru. -Yes!

283
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:36,181
Our enemy is Clayman. Let's crush him!

284
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,853
I've been waiting for that order!

285
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:41,119
Yes, I'm all ready!

286
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,900
And for The Three Beastketeers and the rest of the Brigade.

287
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:48,478
All of us are now under your command.

288
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,314
Yeah, you can count on us.

289
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:54,978
Rimuru, are you sure you can win this?

290
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,385
We will win.

291
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,369
He has angered me.

292
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,876
You sure make it sound easy.

293
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:04,798
Clayman is a Demon Lord who has many Majin under his control.

294
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:07,021
He is not someone to take lightly.

295
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,648
That doesn't matter.

296
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,290
War is not about quantity but quality.

297
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:12,892
Good grief.

298
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:16,095
I can already hear the sound of my common sense crumbling apart.

299
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,048
With that, the long meeting between humans and monsters comes to an end.

300
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:26,548
Once again, we take another big step in making our ideal come true.

301
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,091
I heard all about it.

302
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,329
You're planning to invade Eurazania next?

303
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:39,814
Yeah.

304
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:44,728
Milim obliterated the capital, but that country has a large population.

305
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,689
There are still many humans staying within several scattered settlements.

306
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:54,423
They would make just the right sacrifice for my awakening.

307
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,220
Don't you think so?

308
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,575
So he's planning to kill everyone including the non-combatants?

309
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,911
Sounds like he's forcing it.

310
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,025
Aren't you a little to hasty, Clayman?

311
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:13,254
By the way, do you really have to make a move right before the big event Walpurgis?

312
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:17,571
And isn't there also a non-aggression treaty between Demon Lords?

313
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:20,181
Yeah, that's not problem.

314
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:24,056
My "ringleader" Mjurran was killed by that slime.

315
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:28,395
That is a threat aimed towards me and my Demon Lord's seat.

316
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:32,731
And turned out the one who instigated that was Carrion.

317
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,901
That's how I intent to frame it.

318
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,210
I see.

319
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,488
It would make sense if the other side was the one who betrayed first--

320
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,866
Lil' Mjurran was killed?!

321
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:46,287
Yeah, I heard the whole thing via Marionette Heart.

322
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,423
And the heart I was holding onto turned into ashes.

323
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:51,494
I see.

324
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,322
She was a good girl though.

325
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,181
You sure are kind.

326
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:58,799
Tear told me the other day.

327
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,178
That you must treat tools with care.

328
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,908
Laplace, it was you who taught her that, right?

329
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,556
Which is why I must hold those who broke my tools accountable for it.

330
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,064
Hey, Clayman.

331
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,978
Did you really plan all these yourself?

332
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,781
The only ones who can command me are Great Kazaream

333
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,033
and 'that person' who we are indebted to.

334
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:27,244
You know that better than anyone else, don't you?

335
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,579
I see.

336
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,204
That's all, then.

337
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,708
I'll take my leave now.

338
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,212
But let me give you one last piece of advice as a friend.

339
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:39,507
Don't be overconfident in your control over Demon Lord Milim.

340
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,350
That one has been existing for longer than even our President Kazaream.

341
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,398
She's one of the ancient Demon Lords.

342
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,224
Whatever you do, don't let your guard down.

343
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,642
See ya.

344
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:59,626
Is he trying to say I'm being influenced by someone?!

345
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,603
How annoying!

346
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,950
The more you got hurt

347
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,427
That seed of hope

348
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,989
You plant on both of your hand

349
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:31,239
Will surely bloom someday

350
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:37,250
Whatever it is, it doesn't have to last forever

351
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,802
As long as it makes you smile

352
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:47,528
To find the meaning behind that fleeting moment

353
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,653
Let's go on a journey

354
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,548
Together

355
00:22:55,573 --> 00:23:00,108
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

356
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:04,655
Above the shadow you cast

357
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,382
Reincarnate

358
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:14,377
The full bloom flower will paint color on this dreary world

359
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:18,737
If you were reincarnated

360
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,548
I'd be with you wherever you go

361
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,378
Our souls are connected

362
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:32,151
I'll always by your side

363
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,252
Next time, "The Congress Dances."
