1
00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:05,589
Tempest successfully established relation with the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,883
After Blumund and Dwargon,

3
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:10,539
that makes it our third allied human nation.

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:16,000
With that, the long meeting between humans and monsters comes to an end...

5
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:18,289
...or so we thought.

6
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,859
Come to think of it, what made she come here anyway?

7
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,148
If I remember correctly...

8
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:34,754
It's the golem I made as a replacement for the one I destroyed, isn't it?

9
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:40,391
Congratulation on your evolution to a Demon Lord.

10
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,625
Thanks. Good to see you doing well.

11
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,867
Thank you for your kind words.

12
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:49,945
Please keep listening to Ramiris, unless she starts giving crazy orders.

13
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:51,484
Understood.

14
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,063
I promise I will not betray your expectation.

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,266
By the way, what brings you two here?

16
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:03,141
Lady Ramiris, now is not the time to laze around.

17
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,852
We must inform Lord Rimuru of the news.

18
00:01:05,988 --> 00:01:09,359
Shut up, I'm very busy right now.

19
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:11,688
Please recall your goal coming here.

20
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:15,784
I told you! I just had a fateful encounter!

21
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:20,828
I must find out which suitor will the heroine choose in this wonderful book they call manga!

22
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:21,889
Hey, Ramiris!

23
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:24,501
If you don't want me to spoil it for you,

24
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,194
tell me why you came here already!

25
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,219
Yes, sir!

26
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,600
I'll say it one more time.

27
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,436
This country...

28
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,905
Tempest will be destroyed!

29
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:05,356
Fate repeats all over again

30
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:07,731
The voices of my heart say

31
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,632
Time is not enough, it's over

32
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:16,317
Belief that makes me who I am

33
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,676
Light doesn't fade away

34
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,520
Made my mind up now, it's better

35
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:27,005
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

36
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,928
Lured by your hands

37
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:32,512
Even if it rains don't be swayed

38
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:34,559
Being same as always

39
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,247
Want to feel my destiny

40
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:39,872
Open my eyes to be braver

41
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:43,074
Get up now Get up now stronger

42
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,374
I believe in myself

43
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,600
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

44
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:51,341
I'll never run away

45
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:56,005
I might lose control

46
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:02,184
It's a perfect world

47
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:07,707
Destroy all of it, in the end it's for our good

48
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:10,887
Let me shout like flames

49
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:13,777
(Episode 40: The Congress Dances)

50
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:14,961
Shocked? (Episode 40: The Congress Dances)

51
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,923
No, we're already done with that. (Episode 40: The Congress Dances)

52
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:21,410
That said, I don't want Tempest to be destroyed.

53
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,715
That's why I came all the way here to tell you that.

54
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,104
You better thank me!

55
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,708
But why will we be destroyed, anyway?

56
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,685
Stop panicking and calm down!

57
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,185
Listen, there is an order to things, okay?

58
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,340
We're not really panicking, though.

59
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,942
It was Demon Lord Clayman's proposal.

60
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,348
Clayman?!

61
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:40,942
To launch the Walpurgis!

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,340
So what is Walpurgis?

63
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,700
The banquet of the Demon Lords.

64
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:50,387
A special meeting of all the Demon Lords!

65
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,614
That is Walpurgis.

66
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,848
I've read about it in the old books.

67
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,947
Once, all the Demon Lords came together and waged an epic battle.

68
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,240
Battle?

69
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:05,833
The Western Holy Church named the day of their meeting as Walpurgis.

70
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,544
So Demon Lords gathered to declare war on something?

71
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,729
No! Do I look like I have that much free time?

72
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,309
Why would I want wars and other annoying stuff like that?

73
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,433
You looked like you have a lot of free time, though.

74
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,004
Just to be clear, we had Walpurgis every once in a while.

75
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,305
It's basically a place for the Demon Lords to come together

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,161
for a tea and talk about what happened lately.

77
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:30,896
It's not like we always talk about war or anything like that.

78
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:34,114
Then why would Tempest be destroyed over a tea party?

79
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,809
That's not it.

80
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:39,488
The problem is not the meeting itself, but the topic.

81
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,403
Topic?

82
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:45,762
We launch Walpurgis when at least three Demon Lords agree to hold one.

83
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,997
This time two people agreed to Clayman's Walpurgis request.

84
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,528
Frey and Milim.

85
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:53,676
Milim?

86
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:55,684
Frey...

87
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:01,426
The topic is "New force has been born in the Great Forest of Jura."

88
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,388
"And their leader assumed the title of Demon Lord."

89
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,183
So you declared yourself a Demon Lord?

90
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,559
I did not regret it one bit.

91
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,223
Well, it's not weird coming from you.

92
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:16,942
I'm sure you'll face a lot of trouble, but with all the power you've got,

93
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:18,325
it should work out for you.

94
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:22,887
So Clayman's goal is to punish me for it?

95
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,606
In our line of work, we don't really care who wants to punish who.

96
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:29,331
Line of work?

97
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:33,348
There is a more pressing matter for Walpurgis this time.

98
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,958
It is about Demon Lord Carrion's betrayal.

99
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:38,463
What do you mean by that?

100
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,145
Who are you people?

101
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,637
They're the Three Beastketeers, warriors who serve Carrion.

102
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,348
Anyway, don't complain to me. I'm not the one saying it.

103
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,426
So what betrayal did they claim that Great Carrion has committed?

104
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:55,059
He broke the non-aggression treaty on the Great Forest of Jura

105
00:05:55,084 --> 00:06:00,026
and told you that this Majin named Mjurran is actually Clayman's underling, right?

106
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,364
So he's saying I killed Mjurran?

107
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,044
Is he trying to suppress the Forest of Jura?

108
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,856
How can you be so calm? This is a big deal!

109
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:18,395
I heard Milim took Carrion down

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,833
and Clayman already dispatched his Majin army!

111
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:25,262
Dispatched? So he already made his move?

112
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:29,389
Clayman is shrewder than I thought.

113
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,754
I told you! This is nothing to be so calm about!

114
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:36,879
Calm down.

115
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:40,017
I didn't even kill Mjurran to begin with.

116
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,801
What do you mean?

117
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,947
Clayman is saying some nonsense.

118
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,903
Can you prove that?

119
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,057
Umm, Demon Lord Ramiris.

120
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,254
I am the Majin servant who was allegedly killed.

121
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,221
Eh?

122
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,495
I am Mjurran.

123
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,034
Huh?

124
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,135
Now I get it!

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,567
Clayman is the real culprit, isn't he?!

126
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,318
Clayman, how dare he tried to fool me!

127
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,471
But no one can deceive me, the Detective Ramiris!

128
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:31,701
I am older and smarter than I look! That is me, the Queen of Spirits!

129
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,057
In the name of my grandma!

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,706
Say something! Who are you calling grandma, that's rude!

131
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:39,573
She clearly got influenced by something.

132
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,885
Say, Ramiris. I want to ask you something.

133
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:47,467
What? Just ask Detective Ramiris and she'll crack the case!

134
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:52,263
Clayman took the bait I set with Mjurran's fake death and made his move.

135
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,600
How do you think the other Demon Lords will react to this?

136
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:59,256
Huh? How should I know?

137
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:04,567
They told me what we'll talk about during the party, that's all.

138
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,279
So when is this Walpurgis? Do you know the exact date and time?

139
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,656
Let's see...

140
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:13,264
One... two... three days from now, on the night of the new moon.

141
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,787
So soon.

142
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,654
It's gonna be hard to crush Clayman in just three days.

143
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:22,248
That means the showdown will have to wait until after Walpurgis.

144
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,754
So why'd you come all the way here to tell us?

145
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,465
Well, if you get killed...

146
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,725
Who knows what will happen to my precious Beretta?

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,888
Thank you very much for worrying about me.

148
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:38,018
I've decided to take your side, that's why I'm here!

149
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,662
I'm also gonna build an entrance to my labyrinth here. It's okay, right?

150
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,287
No, it's not okay!

151
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:47,350
What's the big deal? Don't mind the small stuff!

152
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,123
I mind it and you should too!

153
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:51,912
Well, back to reading.

154
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:52,937
Hey!

155
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:57,631
In the end, it seemed the meeting will continue.

156
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:00,857
So we decided to take a rest first.

157
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,522
That tickles!

158
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,881
Stop it!

159
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:10,826
I can wash myself!

160
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,279
There's nothing to hold back, Lady Ramiris.

161
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:17,131
Yes! Please let us help you wash your body!

162
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,395
Is there any place that itches?

163
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,167
Let me wash you this time.

164
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:25,090
Trya came too?

165
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,433
Sounds like they're having so much fun over there.

166
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,324
I should've gone there instead.

167
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:38,949
This sure feels good.

168
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:42,012
Yeah, it heals my body and soul.

169
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,137
Actually, can you even feel this with your homonculus body?

170
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,972
Lil' Eren! How is the bath?!

171
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,949
What a shy girl.

172
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,972
By the way, Sir Rimuru.

173
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:09,168
What is it?

174
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:13,488
I believe having a direct highway connecting our nations

175
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,949
would make it easier for travel.

176
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,534
What do you think?

177
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:21,387
Is he asking us to make the highway?

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,917
Don't you think you're asking a bit too much, Erald?

179
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:30,933
Didn't he also left the highway work to Dwarf Kingdom on us?

180
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,971
I'm okay with Sir Rimuru telling me that, but I don't want to hear that from you!

181
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:35,996
Precisely!

182
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,885
Let's see. I understand where you're coming from.

183
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,478
I'm fine with taking on the work to build the highway.

184
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,643
However.

185
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,901
Yes?

186
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:52,455
I want you to handle the highway maintenance and inn management.

187
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,158
And of course, I'll be taking toll taxes on top of the expenses for it.

188
00:10:57,549 --> 00:10:58,932
I see.

189
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,286
That is reasonable demand.

190
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:07,237
Then I request a chance to negotiate on the toll tax once every several years.

191
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,158
Okay, let's go with that!

192
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,183
So casual!

193
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,799
Good grief, brazen to say the least.

194
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,666
I told you I don't want to hear that from you!

195
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,862
Then it's decided!

196
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,526
Won't the water make you rust?

197
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:01,541
That should be everyone.

198
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,143
Oh you! What are you doing? What's the meaning of this?!

199
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:06,260
What do you mean?

200
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:09,410
The Dryads are giving me really good treatment!

201
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:10,435
What's the meaning of this?!

202
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,982
Isn't that great?

203
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,315
It is great!

204
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,182
Really great!

205
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,073
So Rimuru! I've decided to live here!

206
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,526
Hey, don't decide that on your own!

207
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:27,372
Remember, the Dryads are busy managing things in the forest.

208
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:31,525
They don't live with you anymore, and they can't spend all day taking care of you.

209
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,565
Stingy! Stingy! Stingy!

210
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,484
What's the big deal?

211
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:38,369
If anything happens, this strong gal Ramiris will help you out of it!

212
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:40,018
Are you serious?

213
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:44,033
Lord Rimuru, we promise to take care of Lord Ramiris.

214
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,916
We do hope you will think about it in a positive light.

215
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,119
If you would be so kind.

216
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,049
All right. I will think about it.

217
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:54,074
Really?!

218
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:56,905
Rimuru my boy! That's what I'm talking about!

219
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,479
Well then, please enjoy the food.

220
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,033
We can talk while we eat.

221
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,791
Here you go.

222
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:07,682
Delicious.

223
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:09,533
This is exquisite!

224
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:14,721
Bon appetit!

225
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,386
I'm sure everyone is already tired from all the meeting,

226
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:21,814
but please bear with it.

227
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,592
By the way, Shion.

228
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:25,836
I heard you already questioned the POWs.

229
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:27,829
Did they give anything useful?

230
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:31,893
Of course they did, Great Rimuru!

231
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:38,854
Well...

232
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,010
Questioning? Interrogation?

233
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:45,112
Either way, they did tell us some stuff, Mister Rimuru.

234
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:46,799
Yes, they did.

235
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:49,674
But that was no questioning.

236
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:52,767
I'm not sure if you can even call it an interrogation.

237
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,127
First off, Ed...

238
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,830
Ednoyol?

239
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,268
-Ed... -You mean King Edmaris?

240
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:04,682
Yes. King Edmaris had apparently made contact with a merchant.

241
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,781
That merchant brought him stuff like silken fabrics from our nation

242
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,383
and whetted his appetite for conquest.

243
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:16,939
He feared that trade would drift over to our nation in the future,

244
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,360
which led to his actions in this incident.

245
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,940
Do you know who this merchant is?

246
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,783
Some black-market dealer?

247
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:26,627
We still don't know. I apologize.

248
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,720
That's fine.

249
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:30,048
And what about the Western Holy Church?

250
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,627
Ah yes!

251
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:33,588
We've identified the mastermind!

252
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:35,073
His name was...

253
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:37,979
Erm, the core of it all is...

254
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,642
Niconico Pul...

255
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:42,423
According to Archbishop Reyhiem,

256
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:45,551
The core of it all was Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus.

257
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,557
Yes!

258
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:52,558
The Cardinal was planning to destroy this nation as an "enemy of god."

259
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,080
So he said.

260
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,713
I see.

261
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:59,206
Archbishop Reyhiem wanted the glory for defeating the enemy of god,

262
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,485
so he could earn extra clout against the central authorities?

263
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,430
If they were still planning at the time,

264
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:08,393
then maybe we can still negotiate with the Western Holy Church.

265
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,963
How about I give them some nudge?

266
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:18,276
Dwargon will also advertize our lively trade relationship with Tempest.

267
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:23,922
Then Thalion will officially declare their relations with Tempest to the world.

268
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,301
If we can get the attention of other nations,

269
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:31,038
I'm sure the Western Holy Church will have a hard time making a move.

270
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,307
Yes, I'll be counting on you.

271
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,685
Just leave it to me.

272
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:39,717
Thank you for the food!

273
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,959
Well then.

274
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:44,360
So Youm will take those three prisoners out

275
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,988
and make it look like a triumphal return.

276
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:47,891
Wait.

277
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,075
King Edmaris, Archbishop Reyhiem...

278
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,853
Who's the remaining one?

279
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:55,283
That terribly frightened man?

280
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:58,006
The last man survived, huh.

281
00:15:58,147 --> 00:16:01,514
If I had to guess, it's the captain of the knights, Folgen perhaps?

282
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,897
It was you who caught him, right?

283
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,752
What kind of guy was he?

284
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:08,072
Do you think it'll be okay if we let him out?

285
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,137
He was nothing but a minnow, incapable of being a problem at all.

286
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:15,099
He does appear to be quite well-versed in magic for a human.

287
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,185
So he's a magician?

288
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,188
If so, maybe not Folgen, then.

289
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,280
What is his name?

290
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:22,392
Ramen!

291
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,025
Ramen, huh.

292
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:28,584
Come to think of it, I haven't had ramen in years.

293
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:32,033
Was there a magician named Ramen in Falmuth?

294
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:36,443
Speaking of magic, there's also that Majin Razen in Falmuth.

295
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:37,241
Eh?

296
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:39,353
The Champion Razen?

297
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:41,751
He's a man we must not forget in this matter.

298
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:42,663
Eh?

299
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:47,131
The man known as the guardian of Falmuth and among the most intelligent of Majin.

300
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:47,967
Eh?

301
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:50,279
The man who mastered the way of magic.

302
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:52,720
I've always wanted a chance to fight him.

303
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,224
Well, I'm sure we'd win in close-quarter combat.

304
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,422
But he's surely not a human to be taken lightly.

305
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,537
Shion, are you certain the man we have is named Ramen?

306
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,936
W-Well, probably...

307
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,952
But he's just a young man!

308
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:12,530
He was one of the people who attacked this town!

309
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:15,412
Certainly not the magician everyone is talking about!

310
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,295
What's happening?

311
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:18,483
Report.

312
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:23,209
It is possible to switch bodies using spiritual magic-type technique.

313
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,865
Eh? Then that means this Ramen guy...

314
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,108
E-Ermm...

315
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:29,560
It's Razen.

316
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:30,717
The prisoner's name.

317
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,045
Bingo.

318
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:41,352
So you captured the Champion who supported Falmuth for centuries...

319
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:46,928
He was one of the rare humans who was equal or superior to me as a wizard.

320
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,904
And he took down such a man with ease?

321
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:52,787
He is powerful, no doubt.

322
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,780
All right, Youm.

323
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:55,858
Y-Yeah?

324
00:17:55,883 --> 00:18:00,060
I want you to take King Edmaris, Archbishop Reyhiem, and Razen

325
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,248
and do something with them for me.

326
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,625
So take Diablo with you.

327
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,131
We will start a war against Clayman.

328
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,334
And I'll have Veldora stay here to protect the town.

329
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,436
So I was wondering who should I have to support Youm.

330
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,053
You're perfect fit!

331
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:19,350
I'm counting on you.

332
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,020
Understood, Great Rimuru.

333
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,897
This job might take several years, so I hope you can be patient.

334
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,663
Not a problem, sir.

335
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,277
I shall go and finish it as soon as possible.

336
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,741
You sure are confident, we're talking about destroying a country here.

337
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:38,561
But it is precisely why I can leave it to him with confidence.

338
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:43,217
Well then, about our upcoming war against Clayman.

339
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:47,878
Thanks to Ramiris's report, we now know that he's targeting me.

340
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:52,725
Wonderfully done, Lady Ramiris!

341
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,576
Soei.

342
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:01,350
Yes, sir.

343
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,768
Tell me about Clayman's army.

344
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:04,603
Yes, sir.

345
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:06,045
His army...

346
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,420
Their numbers are roughly 30,000.

347
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:17,031
They're currently organizing their forces at Milim's domain.

348
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,532
30,000 huh.

349
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,264
It's still a manageable number.

350
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,372
The one leading the army doesn't seem to be Clayman himself, however.

351
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,350
Oh?

352
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,194
In terms of magicule capacity, the one with the highest amount would be...

353
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:33,725
Is this guy the commander?

354
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,308
He's Yamza, the Middle Finger.

355
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:36,717
Middle Finger?

356
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:37,729
Yes.

357
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:42,231
The especially strong ones among Clayman's subordinate are known as the Five Fingers.

358
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,234
Yamza, the Middle Finger.

359
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:45,882
Adalman, the Pointer Finger.

360
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,612
Nine-Head, the Thumb.

361
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:49,515
Pirone, the Little Finger.

362
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,705
I used to be the Ring Finger.

363
00:19:55,932 --> 00:20:00,161
Clayman had granted him a magic sword with the power to freeze its target.

364
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:02,743
Which made him known as the Frozen Swordmage.

365
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,082
The Frozen Swordmage...

366
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:09,340
He's a cruel, unfair, and merciless man.

367
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:11,332
But a regrettably talented one.

368
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,423
He willingly swore his loyalty to Clayman,

369
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,843
and we never did get on well for that.

370
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,571
He's the strongest Majin among the Five Fingers.

371
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,241
I see.

372
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:25,737
But it doesn't seem like we need to be wary of him.

373
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,769
Clayman is a cautious man.

374
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,816
He must've known that the Animal Kingdom's Brigade gathered in this town.

375
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:37,027
If he wants to fight us, this force is too weak.

376
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,696
It is odd indeed.

377
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,366
Yeah, that's right.

378
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,346
Could Clayman be aiming at something besides this town?

379
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,187
I see. That might be true.

380
00:20:50,212 --> 00:20:53,360
We all thought he would be aiming for Tempest next.

381
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:55,180
But if that's not the case...

382
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,434
The Animal Kingdom?

383
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:03,803
So they're marching for Eurazania?!

384
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,876
But Milim already took down the capital.

385
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:09,236
There is nothing but refugees left in the surrounding town and village.

386
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:11,125
What would his goal be?

387
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,023
Answer.

388
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,858
It is predicted that Demon Lord Clayman

389
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,820
seeks to awaken himself to become a True Demon Lord.

390
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:23,902
However, his method is crude and based on imprecise theory.

391
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:26,952
He is likely aiming to hunt down all remaining life

392
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,342
in the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania.

393
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:33,584
He's likely aiming to awaken himself into a True Demon Lord

394
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,287
by killing the remaining refugees.

395
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,793
Clayman must've known that us Three Beastketeers and main Carrion's army

396
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:47,954
are taking refuge in this town.

397
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:51,560
So it's the perfect opportunity to trample The Animal Kingdom.

398
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:56,148
We believe Clayman's army will arrive at Eurazania in two days.

399
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,911
Dammit! We won't make it in time even if we head there now!

400
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,279
So he took the first step ahead of us.

401
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,949
Clayman...

402
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,950
The more you got hurt

403
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,427
That seed of hope

404
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,989
You plant on both of your hand

405
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:31,239
Will surely bloom someday

406
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:37,250
Whatever it is, it doesn't have to last forever

407
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,802
As long as it makes you smile

408
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:47,528
To find the meaning behind that fleeting moment

409
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,653
Let's go on a journey

410
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,548
Together

411
00:22:55,573 --> 00:23:00,108
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

412
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:04,655
Above the shadow you cast

413
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,382
Reincarnate

414
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:14,377
The full bloom flower will paint color on this dreary world

415
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:18,737
If you were reincarnated

416
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,548
I'd be with you wherever you go

417
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,378
Our souls are connected

418
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:32,151
I'll always by your side

419
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,252
Next time, "The Eve of Battle."
