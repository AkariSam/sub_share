1
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,461
And so, we finally arrived in
Armed Nation of Dwargon.

2
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:13,453
Today we're here to meet the king of Dwarf,
Gazel Dwargo.

3
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:32,300
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,305
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

5
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:42,060
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,979
Then it's not as fragile anymore

7
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:51,444
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

8
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:54,489
Beyond the page of the chapter

9
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,200
It's welcoming you with a smile

10
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:01,621
Whenever, as much as it takes

11
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,624
Let's start a new world

12
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:08,419
We're Storyteller

13
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:12,549
All the love, hope, envy

14
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,467
Even the song of despair we sing today

15
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:18,513
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

16
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:24,519
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

17
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:29,816
That's just sad

18
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:36,656
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

19
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:43,413
My real self, is now reborn!

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,982
(Episode 27: Paradise, Once Again)

21
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:48,152
First, I would like to express
my thank to you.

22
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,344
Thank you very much for
helping Kaijin and the brothers.

23
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:57,656
Exiling them from here was the best
way to convince the ministers, after all.

24
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,445
So you were planning to forgive
them from the beginning?

25
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:08,836
I figured it also won't be good to let someone
as suspicious as you roaming in the country.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,970
But still, it was a hard decision
to let Kaijin and the brothers go.

27
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,811
We were able to produce armor
thanks to Garm.

28
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:22,844
Dord and Myrd were helping
a lot with construction.

29
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:27,375
Also, Kaijin helped out
in fields that I'm not good at.

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,648
So we managed to work
as a group somehow.

31
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,835
They couldn't do much over here, after all.

32
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,172
It was for the best to have them
go and use their talents elsewhere.

33
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:39,695
What about Vesta?

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,023
Is he not here?

35
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:44,031
Well, I did invite him, but...

36
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:46,555
Hmm...

37
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,593
Thank you for the offer, but
I don't think I can show myself

38
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:53,125
in front of King Gazel before
I accomplish anything yet.

39
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:54,938
That's what he said.

40
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,047
That's just like him.

41
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,922
Then that means he too has finally found
a place where he can use his talent well.

42
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:06,938
So, Rimuru.

43
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,733
There's something I need
to confirm from you.

44
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,734
Yes.

45
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,609
I'm also here for that matter.

46
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,242
The thing that defeated Charybdis...

47
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:21,844
Just what is this so-called
high-power magic weapon?

48
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:27,688
I heard it has the unprecedented power
that surpasses even a strategy class magic.

49
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,703
Actually, that really was the power
of Demon Lord Milim.

50
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,227
Demon Lord Milim?

51
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:36,430
He did say such a joke that day.

52
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,906
But it's not joke, actually...

53
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,219
I'm sorry, but it's hard to believe.

54
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,476
That girl...

55
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,117
Yaaay~!

56
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,555
...That Catastrophe class Demon Lord?

57
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,648
Well, I get why you can't believe me.

58
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:57,938
It's too absurd even for a tall tale.

59
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,461
Very well. I will believe you, Rimuru.

60
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,078
You get that, Dorf?

61
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:06,992
Yes.

62
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:08,332
However...

63
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,586
To think that you managed to
befriend the ancient Demon Lord.

64
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,734
You're truly a man full of wonder.

65
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,188
Why does she look so proud?

66
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,641
I apologize for the wait.

67
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:25,929
What's that?

68
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,875
Well, a little present from me.

69
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,297
Please enjoy.

70
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:45,953
For you too, Lord Dorf.

71
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,054
Thank you.

72
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:48,922
This is...

73
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,336
Did Dord made this?

74
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,844
Precisely.

75
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:57,423
It's excellent.

76
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,859
What a thin and fine symbol.

77
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:03,438
Is this Rune magic for detoxification?

78
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:04,992
How nice of you.

79
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,805
I won't mind tasting for poison
if you like, though.

80
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:14,953
I wouldn't expect you
trying to poison me anyway.

81
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,328
This is a fine wine.

82
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:24,047
This is...!

83
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:26,859
Delicious.

84
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:28,781
It's wonderful.

85
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,273
Then, me too.

86
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,585
Delicious!

87
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,670
Warning.

88
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,972
Poison Resistance.

89
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:38,464
Succeed.

90
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,812
Don't do that!

91
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:42,343
What's the point of wine
without the alcohol!

92
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,508
What's wrong?

93
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,945
Ah, well, it's nothing.

94
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,641
This is a distilled liquor
made from apple.

95
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,977
We just secured an import of fruits,

96
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:53,229
so I believe we can mass
produce this someday.

97
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,347
Import?

98
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:59,402
So you mean you've made a connection
with a country other than Dwargon?

99
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:01,508
Is it with the Kingdom of Blumund?

100
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,875
Yeah, that too.

101
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,421
But the fruits will be from
the Animal Kingdom--

102
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:06,703
Is it Eurazania?!

103
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:07,680
Y-Yeah.

104
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:10,705
The prideful beast king is
doing trades with other countries?!

105
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:15,961
So not only with Demon Lord Milim,
you also befriend Demon Lord Carrion?

106
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,547
What a fearsome seducer
of Demon Lords...

107
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,945
No, no, no.

108
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,570
I just happened to help one of
Demon Lord Carrion's men.

109
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:26,289
So from there, we agreed to
do trades with each other.

110
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:30,391
Well, we're still just sending
out embassy the other day.

111
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:35,109
Even so, now Tempest will become
the new center of attention.

112
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:38,946
It might eventually replace Falmuth as
the new main place for foreign trades.

113
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,734
Indeed.

114
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,398
You're overestimating me.

115
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:47,813
For now, we still have to secure a safe
transportation route to do trades and all.

116
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,125
That matter aside,

117
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,023
what I'm drinking right now is
better than any I've got from Falmuth.

118
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,313
I'm expecting great result from you.

119
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,005
The Kingdom of Falmuth, huh...

120
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,841
That's the name of Youm's
hometown, wasn't it?

121
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:08,172
Got cold?

122
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:11,336
Sheesh, seems like someone
out there is talking about me.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,478
I don't think I've heard him
talking about his hometown.

124
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,992
What kind of country is this
Kingdom of Falmuth, anyway?

125
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,693
Well, they're one of the biggest
country out there in the west.

126
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:27,453
Most of our foods are imports from
Falmuth and the Empire.

127
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,391
However...

128
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,461
Just between you and me.

129
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:36,188
I don't like that king.

130
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,508
Really?

131
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,438
That king is too greedy.

132
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:43,756
That's why you must secure that
deal with Eurazania no matter what.

133
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:48,359
And then, you better share some
drinks to your senior, okay?

134
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:52,431
You being my senior has nothing
to do with this, right?

135
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,008
It will be all okay~!

136
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:59,414
Ah! Shion! When did you start drinking?

137
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:08,742
I'm sure Great Rimuru will make the deal
with Eurazania a success wonderfully!

138
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:09,657
Hey!

139
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:16,247
Then delicious food will start lining
on our table every day!

140
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:22,289
If you put delicious wine on top of it,
then it's practically a sealed deal already!

141
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:25,180
Just leave everything to Great Rimuru!

142
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:34,704
Safe!

143
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,446
Sheesh, this girl is just so hopeless...

144
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:45,961
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

145
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,454
Sorry for what my secretary just did.

146
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:52,867
It's okay.

147
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,024
Just go take her to her room.

148
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,891
W-Well then, please excuse us.

149
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:02,243
That was so embarrassing.

150
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:04,125
Yeah, it sure was.

151
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,532
Great Rimuru...

152
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,969
But still, it makes me want to live
up to her expectation.

153
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,892
Shuna, let's check the script again
once we get to our room!

154
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:18,893
Yes!

155
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:24,977
The next day.

156
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:31,532
Today is the day Dwargon and Tempest
will announce their friendship treaty.

157
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:37,922
This is the place for us to appeal to
the people that we're a good friend.

158
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:42,821
In other words, I'm standing here
representing the whole image of Tempest.

159
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:47,391
I better give a proper greeting
and leave a good impression.

160
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,846
NICE TO MEET YOU, EVERYONE!

161
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:04,686
I'm Rimuru Tempest, the ruler of Jura
Tempest Federation, Tempest in short.

162
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:11,975
Ah, thank you, thank you!

163
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:15,661
Ahem.

164
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:21,428
I'm wishing to build a country that serves
as the bridge between monster and human.

165
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:27,586
Dwargon is a place of coexistence and
co-prosperity between human and monster.

166
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,505
And it is what I'm striving to make.

167
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:35,936
I can't thank King Gazel enough
for supporting my ideal.

168
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:40,201
I hope we can build a relationship
where we can help each other.

169
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:43,553
For that, I need the help
from each and every one of you.

170
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:49,191
There are a lot of monsters,
including me who lives in Tempest.

171
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,639
It truly is a country of monsters.

172
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:57,990
However, what we hold dear is
no different from everyone here.

173
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:02,630
If possible, as opposed to fearing us
because we're monsters,

174
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:05,061
I want you to welcome us as a new friend.

175
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:09,669
I promise you that these words
are coming from my heart.

176
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:12,404
This has been my greeting to all of you.

177
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,100
Great Rimuru!

178
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:29,308
It was not bad of a speech, I must say.

179
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,519
Too short, too humble, too much appeal.

180
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:36,387
To be frank, it was terrible.

181
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:41,090
As a king who rules over a country,
you shouldn't act so humble to the people.

182
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:45,222
Moreover, you will only get yourself looked
down upon by residents from other countries.

183
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:49,809
Mere wishful thinking is no good
in regard to governance.

184
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:53,066
Truly great thing doesn't come naturally.

185
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:55,871
It's something you must
work hard to get.

186
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,301
Yes...

187
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,262
Even back as a salaryman, I'm bad
at doing morning speech, wasn't I?

188
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:10,332
But still, he's undoubtedly saying
all of these for my sake.

189
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm truly blessed with the people I meet.

190
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:15,816
I must be thankful for that.

191
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:22,801
We somehow managed to get
through the big event in Dwargon.

192
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:27,373
That's why, it shouldn't be wrong
to have fun at times like these.

193
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,833
Yes, now that I'm in Dwargon...

194
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,965
There's that place that I can't
possibly forget!

195
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,214
This is the Butterflies of the Night!

196
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,112
The elven paradise!

197
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:48,004
Gobta, you made sure that
Shuna and Shion didn't notice, right?

198
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,480
Of course!

199
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:50,535
Okay!

200
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,777
Let's go to the promised land!

201
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:54,301
Yes, sir!

202
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,113
Welcome.

203
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:01,152
We were waiting for you, Little slime.

204
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,527
I'm here, in paradise!

205
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,105
Erofu!

206
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,340
Ah, I mean elf ladies!

207
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:10,738
Are you doing great?

208
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:12,316
Of course.

209
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:15,121
Hey, me first, okay?

210
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,424
It's here!

211
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,332
He's bouncing.

212
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,199
I'm bouncing~

213
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,855
It has been long.

214
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,871
We thought you forgot about us already.

215
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:33,410
Of course not~

216
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:34,503
Really?

217
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:35,465
Really!

218
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,113
Welcome, young boys.

219
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:39,746
You must be Mr.Slime's friends.

220
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:40,941
Welcome here.

221
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,699
I will be in your care!

222
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,527
Well, what "care" would that be?

223
00:13:58,589 --> 00:13:59,394
I love you.

224
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,074
Oh my, I'm flattered.

225
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:03,832
Gobta sure does crazy stuff sometimes.

226
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:05,926
She let it slide just like that, though.

227
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:08,621
Your companion is already here.

228
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,559
Rimuru, I'm glad that you invite me too.

229
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,691
You helped me a lot, after all.

230
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:19,526
Please let me do this much.

231
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,785
That form does suit you the best.

232
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,098
You don't like my humanoid form?

233
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,199
Well, it's not really about that.

234
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:28,988
It just doesn't fit my impression of you.

235
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,829
Well, it can't be helped.

236
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,075
You should have fun talking with
your brother tonight.

237
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,482
Don't be stupid!

238
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,411
Why should we talk to dudes
in a place like this?

239
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:41,529
We got pretty ladies here,
so let's have all the fun we can get!

240
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,209
He's right, Rimuru.

241
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,763
It's rude to say that here.

242
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:48,591
Ah, these brothers do
resemble each other.

243
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:50,248
Wow, Gobta!

244
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:51,529
You're so good!

245
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,709
Is that so~?

246
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:00,279
This is piece of cake for me!

247
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:07,396
Hey, that's dangerous.

248
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:10,537
That glass is very expensive.

249
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:13,115
So you better not drop it, okay?

250
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,990
So meany~!

251
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:21,088
And if you drop it...

252
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,297
Let's see...

253
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,638
We will have you pay for it
with your body, I guess?

254
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,771
It's just a joke, okay?

255
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:48,380
Manager, can you have a second?

256
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,045
What is it, Little slime?

257
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,935
If you don't mind, would you
have this for the store?

258
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,693
What's this?

259
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:57,040
It's a new wine product we made.

260
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,662
I'm also giving these to King Gazel,
so I can't give out a lot.

261
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,865
But please try serving it
to some loyal customers.

262
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,529
I want to hear some feedback.

263
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:05,755
Oh my.

264
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,052
But are you sure?

265
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,740
I want you to check out how much
we can sell for a glass of this.

266
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:14,966
Oh my.
You sure are diligent, Little slime.

267
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:20,940
You're like a completely different person
compared to when you give a speech back then.

268
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,404
Eh, you were watching?!

269
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:23,498
With my eyes wide open.

270
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:27,130
W-Well, that... was just an act.

271
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:28,630
I looked innocent, right?

272
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:31,443
I will take your word for that.

273
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:34,161
But still, I got a good impression of you.

274
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:34,920
Eh?

275
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:37,080
You looked so sincere.

276
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,990
I believe sincerity is the key
to attract people.

277
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:45,295
In that regard, I give you a full score.

278
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:50,380
I also want to see it.

279
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:56,310
A country where human, monster, elf,
and all other races can smile together.

280
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,014
Thank you.

281
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:09,779
And thus, we end our night with joy.

282
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,834
Hey, get hang of yourself, Kaijin.

283
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:16,588
You drink too much.

284
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:17,964
Yeah, you're right.

285
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,631
What a bunch of drunkard.

286
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,178
And Gobta got anemia.

287
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,147
Hey, Gobta, are you okay?

288
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:27,686
My eyes are spinning...

289
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:28,678
Sheesh.

290
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:33,694
You all better avoid getting found
by anyone on your way back to the inn.

291
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,881
What we experience tonight
is our secret, okay?

292
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:37,748
Yes!

293
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,350
C'mon, let's go.

294
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,442
Do you need a help?

295
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:42,670
Ah, thank you--

296
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:46,787
Sh-Sh-Shu--

297
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:50,571
Warning. Tremendous energy
detected behind that smile.

298
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,186
Ah, I can see it too.

299
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:54,912
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why--

300
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:57,061
"Why are you here?" you ask?

301
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:03,397
Gobzo told me everything.

302
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,061
Gobzo, why?!

303
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:12,551
Eh? Princess Shuna asked where I'm
going, so I just answered her.

304
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,584
What the heck did you just do?!

305
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,022
How awful of you, Great Rimuru...

306
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:24,842
It was awful of you to leave me like that.

307
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,170
Eh, but, well, that's...

308
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:30,155
Why did you go off
without telling me?

309
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:38,209
So it's you guys who invited
Great Rimuru to go on a night out?

310
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:54,600
I have no intention to stop you from
doing the thing you want.

311
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,115
It's just you made us a tiny bit lonely.

312
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,990
Ugh...

313
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:00,646
Well--

314
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,562
Excuses will only worsen the situation.

315
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,295
I just have to be honest here.

316
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,655
I'm sorry!

317
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,006
Lower myself.

318
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:12,402
I won't do it again!

319
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,614
Then appeal to their emotion
with my slime cuteness!

320
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:18,553
Okay?

321
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,725
I understand.

322
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:23,905
Phew.

323
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:27,751
I will let you off the hook with
one week of Shion's morning meal.

324
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,638
Thank--

325
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:29,819
Eeh?!

326
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,162
Are you sure, Princess Shuna?

327
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:33,108
Yes.

328
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,662
Do your best, Shion.

329
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,030
Yes, I will do my best!

330
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:43,772
Too short, too humble, too much appeal.

331
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:47,561
King Gazel, what you said was right.

332
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:50,850
E-Erm...

333
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,662
Can you shorten it to three days?

334
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:53,967
One week.

335
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:56,194
Okay...

336
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:02,327
And thus, we finished
all our business in Dwargon

337
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,326
and are now on our way back home.

338
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:10,990
Ah!

339
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:12,780
There he is, Miss.

340
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,022
He's Youm, the Champion.

341
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:22,040
Hey, Issac. What is it?

342
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:25,844
This miss over here wants to talk
to you, so can you help her out?

343
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,266
Miss?

344
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:35,297
I'm good at magic, so I believe
I can be helpful for a Champion like you.

345
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:39,954
I heard there aren't much
magic-user in your group.

346
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:41,531
That's a shame.

347
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:43,109
We have enough of magic user.

348
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:45,649
Just what can a woman do, anyway?

349
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:51,266
Then I'll show you just how fearsome
a real Wizard can be.

350
00:20:58,407 --> 00:20:59,593
What?!

351
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,344
Earth Lock.

352
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:05,758
I can't move!

353
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,993
She used such a simple magic like that?!

354
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,898
Air Shot!

355
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,906
I will beat you down!

356
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:26,172
It's over.

357
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,719
I'm shocked.

358
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:31,249
You didn't have any single
countermeasure against status effect.

359
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,169
How are you supposed to fight
a magic user like that?

360
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,726
You beat me.

361
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,101
You sure are strong.

362
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:47,289
What's your name?

363
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:48,797
Mjurran.

364
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:51,961
Nice to meet you, Mjurran.

365
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,503
I'm used to losing things

366
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

367
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,053
It's a blurry realism

368
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:30,100
Because it's not about me

369
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

370
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:39,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

371
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

372
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

373
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

374
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

375
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,426
If I can redo this world once again

376
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:09,806
I will paint that story with love

377
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

378
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,979
I will tell you

379
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,356
I will tell you one more story

380
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

381
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,863
I will tell you

382
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,669
Next time, "The Falmuth Kingdom Scheme."
