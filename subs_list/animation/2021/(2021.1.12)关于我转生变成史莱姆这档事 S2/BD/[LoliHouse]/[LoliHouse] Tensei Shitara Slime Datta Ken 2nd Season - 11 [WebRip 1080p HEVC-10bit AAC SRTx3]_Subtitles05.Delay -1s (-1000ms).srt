1
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:04,969
I won't let any single one of you escape.

2
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:15,992
Die.

3
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,859
May the anger of the gods
sear through your very souls.

4
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,648
Megiddo!

5
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:28,812
Report.

6
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:31,422
4214 deaths confirmed.

7
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,195
4803.

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,914
5575.

9
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:38,757
(Episode 35: The Birth of a Demon Lord)

10
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:43,577
R-R-R-R-Reyhiem! What's this?
What now? What should we do?!

11
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:46,414
L-L-Let's calm down first!
We must remain calm!

12
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:48,305
Is King Edmaris still okay?

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,443
What are you doing?! Protect our King!

14
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:51,468
Y-Yes, sir!

15
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:55,992
F-Folgen!

16
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:58,352
Hurry! We must get out of here!

17
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:01,336
We must return to our home
and regroup our forces!

18
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,906
Indeed. We have no idea what has occurred.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,461
We must leave at once, or else we will
get caught in this carnage as well.

20
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:10,227
Shogo? No, you are...

21
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:12,429
It is me, Razen, Your Highness.

22
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:15,805
Oh! Razen! You did well coming back!

23
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,476
Now, let's go home right away.
Using your Teleportation magic!

24
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:23,719
Unfortunately, I can't use any magic
because of this Anti-Magic Area.

25
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:25,288
W-What?!

26
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:26,625
T-Then...

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,680
Do not worry, Your Highness,
Archbishop Reyhiem.

28
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:36,414
I can use my Spearhead unique skill to
force our surviving troops to group together.

29
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,398
They will serve as a meat shield
and protect both of you.

30
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:43,523
Oooh, oooh! I knew I could
count on you, Folgen!

31
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:45,773
We're counting on you, Sir Folgen!

32
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:47,453
I will go and gather our troops.

33
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:49,340
Please prepare for retreat.

34
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:50,856
It shall be done!

35
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,324
I'll die!

36
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:02,582
Everyone will die!

37
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:07,871
It can't be! Just what is happening?!

38
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:21,270
That is...

39
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:22,715
It can't be!

40
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:32,106
Are you... the ruler of the monsters?

41
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,660
That face... are you Japanese?

42
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:37,520
Are you one of the Otherworlder
who attacked my town?

43
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,090
Just the body.

44
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:40,465
It's different guy inside.

45
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:44,410
Well, you're still my enemy anyway.

46
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:51,449
No way! Razen, too?!

47
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:55,496
Picking a fight with a nation of monsters
was a mistake all along!

48
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:58,215
What should I do?
What can I do to survive this?

49
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:02,750
Ah, wait. This could be a chance.

50
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:06,874
He's the kind of guy who's overjoyed doing
trades with a small country like Blumund.

51
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:09,906
He'll surely prostate himself before me

52
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:13,196
once he learns that I'm the king of
the great kingdom of Falmuth!

53
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:16,692
S-S-Spare...

54
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:17,949
P-Please spare us!

55
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,206
Confirmed.

56
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:29,277
The Unique Skill, Merciless
is successfully obtained.

57
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,957
Merciless? What's that?

58
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:36,379
A-Are you the ruler of
the nation of monsters?

59
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:41,309
I am Edmaris, the king of Falmuth kingdom!

60
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:44,817
Bow before me,
for we have matters to discuss!

61
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:48,176
Are you a body double or something?

62
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:51,684
Don't worry, I won't lay a hand
on the real thing.

63
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,988
He is no body double!

64
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:59,168
I swear it by my name as Reyhiem,
archbishop of the Western Holy Church!

65
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,297
All right, I will kill everyone
except for the king. Okay?

66
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,933
K-Kill everyone?

67
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:10,152
Wait! Please wait! I beg you,
please give me your mercy!

68
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:14,348
I wield great power within
the Western Holy Church.

69
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:19,402
I will gladly testify that none of you
are an enemy to mankind!

70
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:21,723
W-Wait!

71
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:24,293
I told you we have matters to discuss!

72
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:26,817
What is it? I'll listen.

73
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:31,777
H-How rude! I am the king of the
great kingdom of Falmuth you know!

74
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:35,523
Normally, I wouldn't even deign
to speak to the likes of you--

75
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:41,687
Listen, take a close look at who
you're talking to before speaking.

76
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:45,203
I allow you to speak, but you
better pick your words properly.

77
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,629
I-It's just a misunderstanding!

78
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:49,809
What part?

79
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:53,137
I-I came here to form a friendly
relation with your country!

80
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:58,145
You declared war on us out of nowhere.
What nonsense are you saying now?

81
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:02,676
From the moment there are casualties
on my side, you all are my enemy.

82
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:06,403
The Western Holy Church sees
all monsters as enemies!

83
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:11,356
So I wanted to check for myself if it
was worth it to make peace with you!

84
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:15,520
The Otherworlder just started
the war on their own!

85
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,707
H-How about this? I will allow you to
forge a formal relation with my country.

86
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:22,418
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
A great honor, if I say so myself!

87
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:25,020
You will profit greatly from it, I'm sure.

88
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,430
W-Well, as the reparations for
what you have done--

89
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,609
Is this guy a genius or what?

90
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:32,735
Just how far does he want
to piss me off with this?

91
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,723
Report. Unique Skill, Merciless has
been completely analyzed.

92
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,848
With it, you can seize the soul of those who
are begging for their lives or seeking help.

93
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:57,403
Which means?

94
00:05:57,428 --> 00:06:02,332
Those who lose their will to fight
in front of this skill will die.

95
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,231
I see.

96
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,363
Anyway, do we have enough souls we need?

97
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:12,020
57.235% of required number
has been acquired.

98
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:13,715
Not enough, huh.

99
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:15,324
If so...

100
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,113
Merciless, huh?

101
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:28,988
I don't think I can make much use of it,
but it seems to fit this situation.

102
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,675
Question. Use the unique skill Merciless?

103
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:34,937
Yeah.

104
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:48,113
With the unique skill Merciless, the soul
of all human in the area has been harvested.

105
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:53,324
However, the individual Edmaris
and Reyhiem have been excluded.

106
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:55,942
It's really merciless.

107
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,423
W-W-W-What happened?!

108
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:06,903
Report.

109
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:12,535
Confirming the nutrient of
human souls needed for evolution.

110
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:15,463
Confirmed.

111
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:17,824
Requirement has been fulfilled.

112
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,840
Evolution to Demon Lord;
Harvest Festival will now begin.

113
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,559
Crap...

114
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:28,137
I got really sleepy...

115
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:34,254
Report. One survivor detected
through Magic Sense.

116
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,918
C'mon, really?

117
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,629
Anyway, I must get out of this
situation somehow.

118
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:43,673
Report. Harvest Festival cannot
be stopped midway.

119
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,566
This is bad.

120
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,636
Ranga.

121
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:49,863
Yes, My Lord?

122
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,879
This is a top priority order.

123
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,355
Protect me and take me
back to the town.

124
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,246
Yes!

125
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,106
Take those two as our prisoner.

126
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,370
Understood.

127
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,528
I sensed one more enemy presence,
what should I do with it?

128
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:05,582
I'll leave it to the other guys.

129
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,973
Anti-Magic Area, dispel.

130
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,410
Activate Summon Demon.

131
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:27,942
I offer all the corpses lying here.

132
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,645
Here, I prepared you food.

133
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,434
Heed to my call, Demon.

134
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,255
Come up and serve me!

135
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,363
Demon?!

136
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:56,043
Hey, there's one guy hiding here,
pretending to be dead.

137
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,309
Capture him alive.

138
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:02,126
This familiar presence.

139
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,295
The birth of a new Demon Lord.

140
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,926
It is truly wonderful.

141
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:09,383
Bountiful offerings and
the first order from my master.

142
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,270
It is such an honor, I might unable
to hold down my excitement.

143
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:17,231
I have been waiting for this day!

144
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:26,000
Would it be all right for me to
continue serving you in the future?

145
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,098
We can talk later.

146
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:31,207
First, prove how useful you can be.

147
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:32,122
Go.

148
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:34,449
It's an easy feat.

149
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,801
Rest assured, Master.

150
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:56,879
Report.

151
00:09:57,258 --> 00:10:00,672
The individual Rimuru Tempest
will now evolve into a Demon Lord;

152
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:03,040
Harvest Festival is about to begin.

153
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,715
This is...

154
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,426
...The Words of the World.

155
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,168
Upon its completion, all monsters in his
genealogy will receive their due Gifts.

156
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:13,879
Great Rimuru!

157
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:17,956
Brace yourselves!

158
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,715
Our master is victorious! It is now
time for us to wield our power!

159
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,004
Great Rimuru!

160
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:36,227
Our Lord needs help!

161
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:38,738
Get him a mantle.

162
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,594
His Thermal Fluctuation Nullification
might not be working.

163
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:43,519
-Yes, sir!
-Glad you're okay.

164
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,410
Great Rimuru...

165
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:03,731
Please don't turn into a different person
as a Demon Lord and go berserk on us.

166
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:09,668
Report. Harvest Festival has begun.

167
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:13,871
The body will be reconstructed and
evolve into that of a new species.

168
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,822
Confirmed.

169
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:34,611
Super Evolution from Slime
to Demon Slime.

170
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:36,603
Succeed.

171
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:40,010
All physical ability has enhanced greatly.

172
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:45,372
Material and Spiritual bodies can
now be transformed freely.

173
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:50,541
Next, reacquiring intrinsic
skills and resistance.

174
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:52,103
Succeed.

175
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,885
Acquiring new Unique Skills.

176
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,664
Infinite Regeneration, Universal Detect,

206
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,011
I managed to stay alive thanks to Survivor.

207
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,985
To think he'd be able to pierce
through my head in an instant like that.

208
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,660
I will now capture you.

209
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:54,206
Feel free to resist.

210
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:59,557
I will not kill you, however, I am
not prohibited from tormenting you.

211
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:00,940
Keep that in mind.

212
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:04,511
Oh, so you're going to be my opponent?

213
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:05,542
Opponent?

214
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:08,738
You're quite a comedian, I must say.

215
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:12,753
Who are you calling a comedian,
you putrid Greater Demon!

216
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,058
Very well. This will be fun.

217
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:21,480
Allow me to join you in a bit
of post-meal calisthenics.

218
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,730
Don't you underestimate me.

219
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:25,886
Nuclear Magic!

220
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,269
Nuclear Cannon!

221
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,347
He reflected it?!

222
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:41,940
No, trigger-type magic prepared in
advance has a slim chance of failing.

223
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,785
That magic just now was
quite impressive.

224
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:48,831
You just got lucky!

225
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,526
Well how about this?

226
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:52,222
Spirit summon!

227
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,706
Come, War Gnome!

228
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,058
High-level spirit of
the earth's foundation!

229
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:09,113
I see, I see.

230
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:13,245
Certainly, demons are strong against angels,
angels are strong against spirits,

231
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,237
and spirits are strong against demons.

232
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:21,027
Based on this three-way relationship, calling
a high-level spirit was the correct choice.

233
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:22,928
However...

234
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:24,202
What is it?

235
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,866
It's too young.

236
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:39,796
See?

237
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:41,342
It lacks the accumulation.

238
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:45,913
Mere puppet with nothing but pure
strength is no match for me.

239
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:51,717
I-It can't be! That was a spirit!

240
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,975
A high-level spirit!

241
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,171
Could it be... are you an Arch Demon?!

242
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:00,991
Enough magic.

243
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:04,499
I would like to test out more of this
body my master has provided me.

244
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,374
Let's change our method.

245
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,655
Anti-Magic Area?!

246
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,358
Why you sealed our magic?

247
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:17,483
Magic is a demon's greatest weapon!

248
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:21,436
Feel free to attack me with whatever
physical attack you prefer.

249
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:25,100
Arch Demon or not, it doesn't matter!

250
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,671
Demon with no magic is
not match for me!

251
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,139
Unique Skill, Berserker!

252
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,241
Those golden eyes...

253
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,272
...and crimson pupils!

254
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,733
This overwhelming power!

255
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,967
It can't be... no way...!

256
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:08,938
C-Could you possibly be... the Primal...

257
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:11,436
Oh my, you sure know your stuff.

258
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,889
It seems like you're quite smart.

259
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:21,983
W-What a horrifying being did that
monster has unleashed upon this world!

260
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:33,147
Oh my, you're done already?

261
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:51,959
Well then, now that my first job is done,
time to go to my master for his praise.

262
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:11,983
Report.

263
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,530
The individual Rimuru Tempest's
Harvest Festival is now complete.

264
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,347
Great Rimuru!

265
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,365
Is now a Demon Lord...

266
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,319
Monsters in his genealogy will
now receive their Gifts.

267
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:23,749
Gift?

268
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:31,936
What?

269
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,600
So this is...

270
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,663
...Gift?

271
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:38,850
I feel strongly connected...

272
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:41,631
...to Great Rimuru even more than ever.

273
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:44,858
My... Lord...

274
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:22,096
Report. Leave the rest to me
and fall into sleep.

275
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,267
Demon Lord?

276
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,384
Did he do it?

277
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:41,098
Report.

278
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,127
By the name of Raphael, I command thee.

279
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:49,398
Beelzebub, consume all magicule
within this barrier.

280
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,580
Do not leave even a single
fragment of soul behind.

281
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,931
He gathered all the magicule
in the area?!

282
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,291
Is that... a spirit?

283
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:35,088
An Arch Demon?!

284
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:40,314
I am back, My Master.

285
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:45,588
Normally, I would wait until
the ceremony was done.

286
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,767
Please forgive my rudeness.

287
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:52,949
It seemed to me you do not have
enough magicule in hand.

288
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:54,822
Yes.

289
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:57,595
The stipulated amount
of magicule is not met.

290
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,934
I will substitute it
by consuming my life force.

291
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,825
Please wait, My Master.

292
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:08,259
I have a good idea. There is no need
for you to consume your life force.

293
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,205
Please use these two.

294
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,236
They would be honored to
be able to serve you.

295
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:20,174
To do so is what gives us the most joy.

296
00:21:21,338 --> 00:21:22,353
Understood.

297
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:25,202
They can compensate for
the lacking magicule.

298
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,174
That offer is accepted.

299
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,697
Beelzebub.

300
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:37,275
Aaaah, how I envy them.

301
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,666
Excuse me.

302
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:54,689
The prescribed amount of
magicule has reached.

303
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,509
Will now conduct the Secret Art of Revival.

304
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,041
Apprising analyzation.

305
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,705
The ultimate secret art of souls!

306
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,458
You're telling me that is a Demon Lord
that just born a few minutes ago?!

307
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:20,010
Not even the Great Carrion can do this...

308
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,549
Wonderful!

309
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:27,322
I must have him let me be
at his service no matter what.

310
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,798
The Secret Art of Revival. Also known
as the Secret Art of Resurrection.

311
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:37,314
An enormous amount of magicule
is needed to make it happen.

312
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:41,244
And the magic required to control it
is beyond anyone could imagine.

313
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:45,869
The success rate is 3.14%.

314
00:22:46,353 --> 00:22:51,502
However, that percentage was calculated
before I transformed into a Demon Lord.

315
00:22:53,556 --> 00:22:55,728
Now that I have evolved...

316
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,419
Next time, "The Unleashed."
