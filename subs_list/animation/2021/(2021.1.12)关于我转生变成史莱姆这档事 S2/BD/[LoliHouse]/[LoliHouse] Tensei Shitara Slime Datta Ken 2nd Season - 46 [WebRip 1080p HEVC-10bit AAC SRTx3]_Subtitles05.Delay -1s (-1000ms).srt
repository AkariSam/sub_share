1
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:06,742
Allow me to introduce the attendees for today's party.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,789
Demon, Lord of Darkness.

3
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:12,008
Guy Crimson.

4
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:15,390
Pixie, Labyrinth.

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,695
Ramiris.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,022
Dragonoid, The Destoyer.

7
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,773
Milim Nava.

8
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:28,362
Giant, Earthquake.

9
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:29,992
Draggull.

10
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:34,034
Vampire, Bloody Lord.

11
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,995
Roy Valentin.

12
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,915
Fallen, Sleeping Ruler.

13
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,094
Deeno.

14
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:45,671
Harpy, Sky Queen.

15
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:46,867
Frey.

16
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,718
Deathman, Marionette Master.

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,304
Clayman.

18
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:58,183
Demonoid, Platinum Saber.

19
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:00,186
Leon Cromwell.

20
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,438
And Slime,

21
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,150
Leader of the Jura Tempest Federation.

22
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,278
Rimuru Tempest.

23
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:12,490
That concludes all.

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,751
First, I would like to thank all of you for attending today in response to my request.

25
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,617
Without further ado, let's begin.

26
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:27,504
Our banquet!

27
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:33,375
I hereby declare the demon lords' banquet; Walpurgis, convened!

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,498
(Episode 46: Demon Lords' Banquet ~Walpurgis~)

29
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,483
So Clayman began his speech. (Episode 46: Demon Lords' Banquet ~Walpurgis~)

30
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,402
To sum it up, what he said is...

31
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:55,073
Demon Lord Carrion enticed me into declaring myself a demon lord.

32
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,536
Carrion's force are staying at Tempest!

33
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,693
That's the proof!

34
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:13,925
He then incited Falmuth into attacking the Great Forest of Jura.

35
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:17,929
He requested Tempest's assistance to fend them off

36
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,057
and meddled with human nations.

37
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:24,478
And after defeating Falmuth, I assumed the title of demon lord,

38
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,855
with Carrion's support behind the scenes.

39
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,404
So he claimed to be the case.

40
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:34,697
Such an unruly action is against the agreement between us demon lords!

41
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:44,178
That is the testimony I have received from Mjurran, one of my subordinates.

42
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:49,327
However, she was murdered by that brute over here, Rimuru!

43
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,717
Thus, I decided to exact my revenge.

44
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,970
Impressive act, I must say. Almost enough to make me cry.

45
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,099
And Rimuru was also conspiring with Carrion to kill me.

46
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:09,998
Mjurran informed me of their ploy with her last dying breath.

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,889
Upon hearing about Carrion's betrayal, Milim flew into a rage,

48
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,577
and burried Carrion along with his nation.

49
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:26,383
I tried to stop Milim from doing so, aware of how little evidence there is.

50
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,960
However, please do not blame Milim for this.

51
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:33,334
She acted out of consideration for me.

52
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,795
I believe everyone in the room now understands.

53
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,805
That trifling majin Rimuru is nothing but a fool posing as a demon lord!

54
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,678
I believe that a purge is in order here!

55
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,834
That concludes my case.

56
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:52,749
We will now listen to testimony from our guest.

57
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,725
Clayman, was it?

58
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,991
You sure are quite a liar.

59
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
What?

60
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:05,412
To be frank, I don't care about becoming a demon lord.

61
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:08,748
Your story about Carrion luring me into this is total nonsense.

62
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,326
And Falmuth attacked us out of their own greed.

63
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:16,423
And who do you think will believe such an excuse?

64
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:19,178
You killed one of my subordinates!

65
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:21,248
Mjurran is alive.

66
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,973
Are you out of your mind?

67
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:28,881
Mjurran who you claim to gave you testimony is now under my protection.

68
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,062
I won't let you lay a finger on her,

69
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,025
and validity of your claims are close to none.

70
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,402
You're willing to stoop to such lows, then?

71
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,695
Low?

72
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:42,949
You meddle with her corpse and had some evil spirit possess her, perhaps?

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,703
Well, I knew you wouldn't trust whatever I say.

74
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:47,889
Which is why...

75
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,616
Look at this.

76
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,592
Stop it! Please stop it!

77
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:58,553
Great Clayman!!!

78
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,053
N-No way!

79
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:08,016
Clayman's forces are destroyed. This mission is a failure!

80
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,602
The losses are immense!

81
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,514
Like he was told to, he really should just--

82
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,147
"Told to," huh.

83
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,776
Seems like there's someone manipulating Clayman from behind.

84
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:21,364
Answer. It is estimated that all of this is related.

85
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:27,937
That means whoever tried to make me fight Hinata was also manipulating Clayman.

86
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,927
This is what you call a proof, Clayman.

87
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:36,002
A-All of this is fabricated!

88
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,464
A bluff of fake images made with magic to support his lies!

89
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:43,319
That's just low, even for a slime!

90
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:46,221
It's not a bluff, moron!

91
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,348
I already crushed your army.

92
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,762
Next is you.

93
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,398
E-Everyone! Don't listen to this trickster!

94
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,484
This slime is a notorious bluffer!

95
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,737
He undoes the seal on Veldora to destroy Falmuth's force,

96
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,701
and parades as if it was all his doing, like a weakling that he is!

97
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,742
His outrageous attempt to join the rank of proud demon lords is unforgivable--

98
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,539
Hey, Clayman.

99
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,665
Huh?!

100
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:18,211
Didn't you say Carrion and Rimuru over there worked together

101
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,715
to defeat Falmuth's army?

102
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,300
Even if the rumor about Veldora's revival is true,

103
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,971
why would he do something so roundabout?

104
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,431
W-Well, about that...

105
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:33,210
A-All right. Allow me to explain.

106
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:39,274
This low-class, unwitting slime must've fortunately acquired a demon lord seed!

107
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,538
He must get overjoyed about it

108
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:44,070
and traveled to human realms to learn the truth about it.

109
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:48,325
That drove him to set off a war with the humans on a whim,

110
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:52,412
using the banished Veldora to stage a brutal genocide!

111
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,746
If we leave something like this run free,

112
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,560
it would damage our reputation as demon lords!

113
00:06:57,593 --> 00:07:01,868
Purge! I believe he must be purged!

114
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,805
How about it?!

115
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,789
So give us some evidence.

116
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:12,937
Everything you just said was just stuff you wish to happen.

117
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:16,436
And you really think everyone just gonna swallow it?

118
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,594
Don't you underestimate me!

119
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,811
You mere slime swaggering behind the Evil Dragon!

120
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:22,609
Someone like you could never become a demon lord!

121
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,028
My being a slime has nothing to do with this.

122
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,197
And Veldora is my friend.

123
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:30,882
I'm not here to listen to your boring story.

124
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,786
Just admit it already.

125
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,956
The fact that Charybdis was resurrected at your demand

126
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,751
has been proved by a majin named Phobio.

127
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:45,090
It's those jesters there who guided him to.

128
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:49,797
And in fact, one of your men transformed into Charybdis and went on a rampage.

129
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,514
This what you call a solid evidence.

130
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:55,016
You can call it a bluff if you like.

131
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,804
But if you really think so, then die!

132
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,531
E-Everyone!

133
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,617
Should his reckless violence be allowed?!

134
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,579
This is an insult towards us demon lords!

135
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,165
Shouldn't we all give him suitable punishment at once?

136
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:23,044
And speaking about violence.

137
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:27,445
You were trying to control my mind in the middle of your speech, no?

138
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,052
Such an attack is pointless against me.

139
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:36,477
Are you telling me such an act is allowed here in Walpurgis?

140
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,305
No.

141
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,020
In order to keep things fair,

142
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,859
we are only allowed to appeal with our own words.

143
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,651
H-However, Guy!

144
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,861
He's insulting us all--

145
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,133
Shut up already.

146
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:54,297
If you don't like me, then it's between you and me, isn't it?

147
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:59,956
Like I said before, I don't care about becoming a demon lord.

148
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,252
I just want to make my own country where I can live happily.

149
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:07,088
And I need help from humans to make that possible.

150
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,341
That's why I decided to protect them.

151
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,812
If anyone dares to get in my way,

152
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:16,586
be it demon lords or Western Holy Church, they're all equally my enemy!

153
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,142
Just like you.

154
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,594
Clayman!

155
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,781
He's right, Clayman.

156
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,904
If you're a demon lord,

157
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:35,461
then show us that you can defeat that majin on your own.

158
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,789
And do you have any intention on declaring yourself a demon lord?

159
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,031
Yeah.

160
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,250
I already accepted the role of the Leader of the Great Forest of Jura.

161
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,672
From the human's perspective, I'm practically a demon lord.

162
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,711
Very well.

163
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,716
We have an array of witnesses here as well.

164
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:56,680
If you can win against Clayman before us, we will allow you to assume the title.

165
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,820
So everything will warp up nicely if I win against Clayman.

166
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,687
Well, well.

167
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:10,109
I was trying not to get my hand dirty, but seems like it can't be helped.

168
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:12,403
What a mistake.

169
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,672
This must be what they mean by schemer drowns in his own scheme.

170
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:17,992
You're up, Milim.

171
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,472
So in the end you're just relying on others?

172
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,434
And you have face to get Milim involved, though you punched her just a while ago?

173
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,853
Don't be ridiculous.

174
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,021
I will be fighting, too, of course.

175
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,899
Is there any issue with that, Guy?

176
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,192
Not at all.

177
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:55,239
If Milim is aiding you on her own free will, then I won't stop her.

178
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,532
This is seriously bad.

179
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,243
Clayman aside.

180
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,234
Milim is a bad news.

181
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:06,367
No, I will definitely save her.

182
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:09,187
I will release you soon enough!

183
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,170
Fine by me.

184
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,798
I was planning to rescue Milim from the start, anyway.

185
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,508
Guess I will just break your mind control on her by force.

186
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,922
Enough of your prattle!

187
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:20,263
You will die here in despair.

188
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,516
The one dying here is you, Clayman.

189
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:25,644
Fighting you myself would just make me a bully.

190
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:28,258
My underling is enough for the likes of you.

191
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,437
What did you say...?!

192
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,929
Can I punch him now, Great Rimuru?

193
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:55,562
Normal people ask before they act, though.

194
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,931
Y-You!

195
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,328
You! You!

196
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,328
Ultraspeed Regeneration, huh.

197
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,273
Even a man like him is still a demon lord.

198
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:13,727
I will kill all of you just as you wish!

199
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,330
Report.

200
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:32,378
It must be one of Clayman's Five Finger, the Thumb Nine-Head Mjurran mentioned.

201
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,880
She did mention that before.

202
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:04,164
Clayman, the guy in black robe.

203
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:06,766
Three demon beasts.

204
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,040
And Milim.

205
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,499
Ah, wait.

206
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,084
We're outnumbered!

207
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,044
Beretta!

208
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:27,849
This is...

209
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,893
Report. This is a barrier deployed by demon lord Guy.

210
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:35,065
It is believed that this barrier blocks any contact between outside and inside.

211
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,898
This is bad!

212
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,739
Milim, kill him.

213
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,785
I used Mind Acceleration to improve my reaction speed

214
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,859
and use Raphael's ability to the fullest,

215
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:51,625
and I still only barely avoided it?!

216
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,758
Doesn't seem like I can afford doing a counter.

217
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,828
The only thing I can do is focusing on breaking the mind control on Milim.

218
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:11,695
Insolence!

219
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,078
Shion, Ranga!

220
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:35,383
Please buy enough time for Raphael finish appraising Milim!

221
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,094
Lady Ramiris.

222
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,289
I would like to participate in this fight.

223
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:51,849
Hey, Guy!

224
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,187
I'm joining Rimuru's side, so let my Beretta in, too!

225
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,291
No.

226
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,469
Why!

227
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:06,531
Mere attendants aren't allowed to join a battle between demon lords.

228
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,633
And this is a dispute between that slime and Clayman.

229
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:12,371
You have no reason to join in.

230
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,871
What are you talking about!

231
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,873
Milim's in there, isn't she?!

232
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,126
She's fine.

233
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,544
What? Then why she's fine and I'm not?!

234
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,003
Shut up.

235
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,117
I'm sure Milim has something in her mind.

236
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:26,891
And you're saying I have none?!

237
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,406
Is there?

238
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:29,477
Besides.

239
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,805
Who has your attendant sworn its loyalties to?

240
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:38,856
Your other companion seems to be devoting her all to protect you.

241
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,107
But that golem is not.

242
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,777
It's faithful to you, but not completely.

243
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,930
Can you really trust someone like that?

244
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:49,575
Indeed.

245
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:53,035
I place my master on the balance.

246
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,456
Lord Rimuru who is both my master and creator.

247
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,125
And Lady Ramiris.

248
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,516
However, Lord Rimuru wished me to protect Lady Ramiris.

249
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:08,302
And I also have acknowledged Lady Ramiris as my current master.

250
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,781
There is no contradiction.

251
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,977
I want to repay my favor to Lord Rimuru.

252
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,352
And just like how I wish for that.

253
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:23,065
Lady Ramiris also wishes to rescue Lord Rimuru.

254
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,820
Hmm, so you dare to speak your opinion against me.

255
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,279
Ramiris.

256
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,531
May I trust this golem its words?

257
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,914
Of course!

258
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,288
So it will take action if you wish it to, huh?

259
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,833
You sure obtained yourself a nice attendant, Ramiris.

260
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,668
Nope! Not obtained!

261
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,546
We're friends!

262
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,203
Beretta,

263
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,078
and Treyni.

264
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,992
And also Rimuru!

265
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,517
And a lot of others, too!

266
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,523
Well, all right.

267
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:03,731
I thank you, Primordial of Red, Rouge.

268
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,441
Don't call me with that name.

269
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,069
I allow you to call me Guy.

270
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:13,183
But Ramiris should be your one and only master from now on, understand?

271
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:18,288
Guy, I hereby swear to pledge my loyalty only to Lady Ramiris from now on.

272
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,747
Are you really okay with that?

273
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,790
Yes.

274
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:25,148
Lord Rimuru has servants stronger than myself.

275
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,340
And I enjoy conducting research.

276
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:33,511
Those days I spent with Lady Ramiris on our research was truly like a dream.

277
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,639
Oh, pardon me.

278
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:39,227
Let me ask, what's your lineage like?

279
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,897
I was formerly a greater demon.

280
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:48,776
However, I believe you will find very few demons of the same family tree as I.

281
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,529
A small lineage, is it?

282
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,780
I see.

283
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,366
No wonder you're not afraid of me.

284
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,008
That family always was self-centered and only driven by their curiosity.

285
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:03,208
And you're saying there's someone stronger than you?

286
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,751
I still have far to go.

287
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,504
As "that man" also serving Lord Rimuru,

288
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,875
this could be my only chance to repay the favor.

289
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,760
Hmm, I see.

290
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,031
I understand how you feel.

291
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,663
You may go.

292
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,811
Excuse me, then.

293
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,117
Good luck, Beretta!

294
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,567
I see, so that's it, huh?

295
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:33,655
So you're on the move as well, Primordial of Black, Noire.

296
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,616
If Noire is serving him, that means...

297
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:42,788
That slime must be quite the fascinating figure.

298
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,041
Rimuru, was it?

299
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,626
I'll remember him.

300
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,134
This is really bad!

301
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,180
If I don't have Raphael, I would die in an instant!

302
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:05,190
How do you like Viola? She's my greatest work yet.

303
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,516
Beautiful, isn't she?

304
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:20,234
It is pretty strong, but is it really as beautiful as he claims it to be?

305
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,715
She's furious.

306
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,218
Once she blew up, things will get crazy.

307
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,109
I apologize for making you wait.

308
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,097
Lord Rimuru.

309
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,265
Please utilize my power.

310
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,680
I was waiting for you, Beretta!

311
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,103
Go and assist Shion!

312
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,227
Yes, sir!

313
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,063
No need to hold back, Beretta!

314
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,383
Crush him!

315
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:53,172
All right! Now she won't lose.

316
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:57,430
All left is to break Milim's control, and the win will be in the bag!

317
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:05,664
Raphael, appraise the curse Clayman put on her!

318
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:07,332
(Analytical Appraisal in full power)

319
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,254
Answer. The outcome of Analytical Appraisal.

320
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,547
Tell me!

321
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,383
No curse found.

322
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:19,055
Huh?! What does that mean?!

323
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:20,636
You're not telling me...

324
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,431
you can't even figure out the silly curse Clayman put on her, right?

325
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,391
No curse-oriented magic found.

326
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:29,141
-Which means-- -Man, just how useless you get?

327
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,650
Why are you mad! I'm the one who's mad here!

328
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,195
This is bad!

329
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,703
Things will end up real bad at this rate!

330
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:43,701
Or maybe she will be back to her senses if I punch her real hard?

331
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:48,398
Suggestion. An energy absorption attack using Beelzebub.

332
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:49,711
That's it!

333
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:53,600
Beelzebub!

334
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,804
It's working!

335
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,461
All right, this should do it!

336
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:09,769
Let's chip away at her like this and wait for her curse to be undone!

337
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,891
Opening!

338
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,250
Report. It is believed to be a trap.

339
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:32,984
I'll die!

340
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:38,375
Rimuru...

341
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,234
What are you doing all of the sudden?! That hurts!

342
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,750
V-Veldora...?!

343
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,950
The more you got hurt

344
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,427
That seed of hope

345
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,989
You plant on both of your hand

346
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:31,239
Will surely bloom someday

347
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:37,250
Whatever it is, it doesn't have to last forever

348
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,802
As long as it makes you smile

349
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:47,528
To find the meaning behind that fleeting moment

350
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,653
Let's go on a journey

351
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,548
Together

352
00:22:55,573 --> 00:23:00,108
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

353
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:04,655
Above the shadow you cast

354
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,382
Reincarnate

355
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:14,377
The full bloom flower will paint color on this dreary world

356
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:18,737
If you were reincarnated

357
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,548
I'd be with you wherever you go

358
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,378
