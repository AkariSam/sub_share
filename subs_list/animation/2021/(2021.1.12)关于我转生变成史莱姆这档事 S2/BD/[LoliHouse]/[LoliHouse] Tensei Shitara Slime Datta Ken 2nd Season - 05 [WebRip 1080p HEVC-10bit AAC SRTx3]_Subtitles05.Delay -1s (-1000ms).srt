1
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,859
Finally awake?

2
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:17,320
Yeah...

3
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:18,813
This is great.

4
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:23,063
It was worth it to get
beaten by Master.

5
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,703
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:26,460
You're a human.

7
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,492
You better watch out or else you might die.

8
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:33,563
You're talking as if you're
not a human yourself.

9
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,288
Resting on your lap
sure feels great.

10
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:40,094
I would love to wake up here
every morning if it's possible.

11
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,367
Idiot.

12
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:42,851
Ouch.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,859
If you're energetic enough to crack
a joke, hurry and get up already.

14
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,925
Let's go back to our lodging.

15
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:50,260
Didn't you promise

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,820
to join in magic battle training
with Rommel and others?

17
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,461
O-O-Ouch, that's enough.

18
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,102
I wasn't joking though.

19
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:05,445
Youm...

20
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,594
But...

21
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,961
My heart is ruled by
Demon Lord Clayman.

22
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:14,938
I'm just his puppet.

23
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:23,625
He's really... just a stupid man.

24
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:45,258
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

25
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:50,263
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

26
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:55,018
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

27
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:57,937
Then it's not as fragile anymore

28
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:04,402
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

29
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,447
Beyond the page of the chapter

30
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:10,158
It's welcoming you with a smile

31
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:14,579
Whenever, as much as it takes

32
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:17,582
Let's start a new world

33
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:21,377
We're Storyteller

34
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:25,507
All the love, hope, envy

35
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:27,425
Even the song of despair we sing today

36
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:31,471
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

37
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:37,477
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

38
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:42,774
That's just sad

39
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:49,614
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

40
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:56,371
My real self, is now reborn!

41
00:02:57,787 --> 00:02:59,138
(Episode 29: Prelude to Calamity)

42
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,754
I heard Great Rimuru will be
coming back soon.

43
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:05,019
Then we better hold up
a proper welcome!

44
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,898
This is a fine item.

45
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,542
Hey, be careful okay?

46
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:30,086
Watch out for what's in front of you
or you will get hurt.

47
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:34,507
Well, if they did we can just heal them up
in a zippy with these high potions we made.

48
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,741
Oh!

49
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:38,572
Ms.Mjurran, good day!

50
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:39,597
Hello.

51
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,141
What a nice weather we're having today.

52
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,711
C'mon, we got place to go.

53
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:55,336
My bad. It's nothing.

54
00:03:56,796 --> 00:04:00,023
What's wrong, Grucius? Is that all you got?

55
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,829
There!

56
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,218
I gotta give a chance for my Boss
to shine, after all.

57
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,344
Gibberish!

58
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:13,961
-- Keep it up!
-- Do your best!

59
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:15,015
Now's the chance!

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,241
That's the spot!

61
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,976
It has been a while, Mjurran.

62
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,546
Are you doing well?

63
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,875
L-Lord Clayman...

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,906
I didn't expect you would contact me now.

65
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:40,198
Things over here have been going quite well
thanks to the information you brought.

66
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:46,000
So great in fact, I feel like returning
your heart which you entrusted me.

67
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:51,008
Does that mean...
I'm no longer useful to you?

68
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,421
Oh heavens no.

69
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,452
I'm still wishing you to do more for me.

70
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:01,172
I want you to do one more job.

71
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:06,008
You won't refuse, will you?

72
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:08,852
It's not like you want to die anyway.

73
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:13,439
And of course, you wouldn't want to see
the man you love to die a gruesome death.

74
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,437
The man I love? I have no such--

75
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,922
Cut the jest.

76
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:23,492
Don't you look down on me, Mjurran.

77
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:28,187
All you have to do is to follow
my order, nothing else.

78
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,461
Well then, just sit tight until
I give you your orders, okay?

79
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:38,000
When it is all over,
I will free you at last.

80
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:42,554
To live with your beloved man
will no longer be a mere dream.

81
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:47,383
A dream...

82
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:55,375
How pitiful.

83
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:01,492
Is this a trap?

84
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:03,945
That got to be it.

85
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,133
But...

86
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:09,828
Just if...

87
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:13,820
My dream can really come true...

88
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:21,398
I will surely sell my soul to the devil.

89
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:27,914
Fully armed group of human?

90
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,125
They're the knights from Falmuth kingdom.

91
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:32,703
They're heading to Tempest.

92
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,117
There are around one hundred of them.

93
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:44,515
Their objective is unknown, but it appears
Falmuth is preparing to engage in a war.

94
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,140
This might be a bad news.

95
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:50,244
It sure seems like it.

96
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,484
What about Great Rimuru?

97
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,344
He should be arriving here soon.

98
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:57,578
I believe it's better to inform
this to him immediately.

99
00:06:57,703 --> 00:06:58,453
Okay.

100
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,047
Respond...

101
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,298
Requesting for respond.

102
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:06,054
I'm one of the Three Beastketeers
of Animal Kingdom of Eurazania.

103
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,887
Albis the Golden Serpent.

104
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,296
Lady Albis!

105
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:10,848
Benimaru here. What's wrong?

106
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,375
We have a favor.

107
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:17,133
We want you to accept refugee
from our country.

108
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,356
Refugee?

109
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,649
What happened?

110
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:23,344
Eurazania will enter a state of war
in one week.

111
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,445
A war?!

112
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,476
With which country?

113
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,711
It's not a country.

114
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,453
Our opponent...

115
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:31,703
Is the Demon Lord Milim.

116
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,874
Hey, what does that--

117
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:50,763
Hey!

118
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,687
Hey! Hey! Hey!

119
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:57,375
This country is much more advanced
than Falmuth!

120
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,438
You got to be kidding me!

121
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,508
Why the hell are monsters
living better than we are?!

122
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,171
Yeah, what's the deal with this?

123
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:06,648
Why are they getting
better stuff than us?!

124
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:08,461
This ruins my mood, totally.

125
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:10,250
There, there, Kirara.

126
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:12,640
But you have a point.

127
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,851
This is not interesting.

128
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,000
This place is running by a slime, right?

129
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:24,695
If we kill that damn thing, we can
take over this whole town, right?

130
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,554
That's a nice idea, I'm on it!

131
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,906
I like that idea too, but we can't
stray from our orders too much.

132
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,437
That would fine.

133
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:35,599
We're here to cause a riot, right?

134
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,268
Then it's a perfect opportunity.

135
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,687
Yeah, totally.

136
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:42,867
We just need the "record" that
monsters do attack lawful citizens.

137
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:46,742
True, that is what Sir Razen told us to do.

138
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:49,500
Quit calling that geezer with "Sir."

139
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:50,742
Totally.

140
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,015
I wish that geezer would just die already.

141
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:55,765
Then we'd be free at last.

142
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,461
Sorry, it's a habit.

143
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:01,875
It would be bad if we diss him
right in front of his face, right?

144
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:03,367
Well then!

145
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,492
Let's start right away!

146
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,906
Y-You just touched
my butt just now, didn't you?

147
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,969
Could it be you were trying
to assault me just now?

148
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,679
But I didn't do anything!

149
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:29,875
Don't play dumb with me!

150
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm telling you to explain to me what
intention do you have when you assault me!

151
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:35,998
Do you understand?

152
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,537
That hurts~!

153
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:44,764
Hey, did that hobgoblin
just attack that girl?

154
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,319
He's this town's guard.

155
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:48,326
Seriously?

156
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:51,209
I heard monsters here are supposed
to be calm and friendly.

157
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,344
So monsters really are
monsters in the end, huh.

158
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,389
Kirara's unique skill sure is scary.

159
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,474
Yes.

160
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,977
Bewilder affects your mind on
unconscious level, after all.

161
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,170
They will believe in Kirara's words
and do as she says.

162
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:11,615
Whoa there, so people in this town
would attack visitors?

163
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,638
So this is all your plan
all along, monsters?

164
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:18,115
Now that you think about it,
he does have quite a nasty look.

165
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,912
Then it must be on purpose.

166
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,881
Hey, won't it be better to call
the guards?

167
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,647
N-No, this is a mistake.

168
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:26,717
I didn't do anything.

169
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:30,654
What Falmuth wants is an excuse
to invade this country.

170
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:34,803
In other words, the "fact" that
monsters harmed a human.

171
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:40,474
It would have been much more impactful
if this idiot-face gets angry, but oh well.

172
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,264
What's up with this commotion?

173
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,187
What's wrong, Gobzo?

174
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,967
I, I just...

175
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:50,109
You sure cause us trouble
every once in a while.

176
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:56,725
We're very sorry. I will make
sure to educate him properly.

177
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,701
Gobta, but I...

178
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,287
You didn't do anything, right?

179
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,581
But that doesn't matter.

180
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,795
It's our lost once they
start suspecting us.

181
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:09,962
G-Gobta, so you really believe in me?

182
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,990
It's needless to say.

183
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,194
I will follow you forever!

184
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:17,842
Eh, c'mon, that's enough.

185
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,795
H-Hey, what's up with that!

186
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,819
Are you trying to say that I'm lying?!

187
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:25,319
Oh, it didn't sound that way?

188
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,701
Don't give me that, you shitty goblin!

189
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:31,139
You got a nerve
trying to pick a fight with me!

190
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:35,100
You didn't even see anything, so how
could you even believe in him?

191
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,451
It's natural for us to trust our friends.

192
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:40,784
What? Do you think that lame
excuse can convince me?!

193
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,288
To begin with, this guy over here
got a thing for Shion.

194
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:47,295
She's like, "this" great.

195
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,514
So there's no way he'd try to lay
his hand on a young lady like you.

196
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:56,170
Hey, why did you say that!
It's supposed to be a secret!

197
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,966
Everyone knows about it already,
it's already too late for that.

198
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,334
Everyone?

199
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,779
Yes, everyone.

200
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,467
You better just give up, Gobzo.

201
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:08,103
I thought about following you forever,
but not anymore!

202
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:15,686
That's it, you pile of shits.

203
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:17,811
There's no holding back now!

204
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:20,029
All of you...

205
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,619
...will die now!

206
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,289
(Unique skill: Bewilder)

207
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,129
There she did it.

208
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,803
Serves you right.

209
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,522
No way, why won't anyone die?

210
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,154
I see.

211
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,248
So your skill converts your
voice into wavelength

212
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,599
and interfere with
your targets' brainwaves.

213
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:06,319
It's a very fearsome power, so I hereby
prohibit you from using it in this country.

214
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:11,756
This woman. She nullifies the power
of my skill, the Bewilder.

215
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:20,826
It seems like you people do
not belong in this country.

216
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,554
Please, leave now.

217
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,029
No way... I can't believe this.

218
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,740
They're like a real monster.

219
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:30,519
I see.

220
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,479
So that's how you want to do this.

221
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:37,623
Fine by me. If that's what you want,
I will get serious too.

222
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,989
I will make you my slave.

223
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,779
I will torment you until you beg
for my forgiveness.

224
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:46,827
You lowlife.

225
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,490
Your licentious thoughts are written
all over your face.

226
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:54,626
We will not harm you if you agree
to leave this town peacefully.

227
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,944
However, if you refuse to do so...

228
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,591
Interesting!

229
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,037
If you're going in my way,
then I will crush you!

230
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,765
I see.

231
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,787
Seems like you won't learn
a thing without a beating.

232
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,483
Very well. I will be your opponent.

233
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,373
Now that it comes to this,
I will do as I wish.

234
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:28,311
The truth is, I have always wanted
to test out this power.

235
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:35,084
I can't wait to find out just
what can I do with my Severer.

236
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,086
(Unique skill: Severer)

237
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,004
This looks dangerous.

238
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,092
Gobzo, you better go and protect
Princess Shuna.

239
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:43,600
Y-Yes, I got it!

240
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,679
(Extra skill: All Seeing Eye)

241
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:53,733
With my power, I won't lose even
to that old hag Hinata!

242
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,529
Much less to a small fry like you!

243
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,069
A high magic?

244
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,990
Yes. I want you to turn the Central City
of Rimuru into an anti-magic area.

245
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,615
The goal is to cut any
contact with outside forces.

246
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,615
Get right on it immediately.

247
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,701
This will be your last job.

248
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:17,876
This finally gets interesting.

249
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,087
A great war will begin.

250
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,841
An unforeseen flow has brought up
an unexpected development.

251
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,843
Well then, shall we see.

252
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,761
Where are you going?

253
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,266
Do you need something from me?

254
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,615
Cream puff.

255
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:35,853
Cream puff?

256
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,881
It's a new type of dessert.

257
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:39,639
They just got it over at the dining hall.

258
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,137
I heard it's really delicious.
Let's go and eat it.

259
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:45,974
Thank you for the offer,
but I just ate one yesterday.

260
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,551
Is it with Youm?

261
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:48,600
Y-Yeah.

262
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,865
Tch, that bastard. Trying to
be a step ahead of me again.

263
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:56,123
I have a business to attend to,
so see you later.

264
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,092
Later?

265
00:15:58,022 --> 00:15:59,842
Will we really meet again later?

266
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,397
I actually got quite a peculiar
news just now.

267
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,637
It says we just received a declaration
of war from Demon Lord Milim.

268
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,881
What a ridiculous story, I thought.

269
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:16,226
But I saw you acting pretty suspicious.

270
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,272
So I got a bit curious.

271
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:21,631
So this is why Clayman
is rushing on things.

272
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:25,451
Demon Lord Milim's declaration
of war must be unexpected to him.

273
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,459
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

274
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:28,490
Mjurran!

275
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:33,420
But still, why does he want to cut
off all communication from this country?

276
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,693
I see. It must be because
of Rimuru Tempest.

277
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:40,201
He's scared of that Slime getting
the news and join in early.

278
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,373
Mjurran!

279
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:45,214
I must hurry up and
activate the magic as ordered.

280
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,924
Or else Clayman would get angry

281
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:51,162
and kill not only me but
everyone else in this town.

282
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:52,053
Hey!

283
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:56,959
If Demon Lord Milim is the opponent,
won't your master also be in danger?

284
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,688
You speak as if you know
about Demon Lord Milim.

285
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:06,985
No need to worry,
Great Carrion is invincible.

286
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,196
There is no way he would
be defeated.

287
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,404
What important here is you.

288
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,397
You're a Majin, right?

289
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,794
Just why are you so sharp
only at times like these?

290
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:24,779
Then--

291
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:26,922
But I have no choice, Grucius.

292
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,467
I like you too.

293
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,154
As a friend, that is.

294
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,222
However...

295
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,266
If you're going to get in my way...

296
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,467
I won't hesitate to kill you.

297
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,951
You... are that determined?

298
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:51,561
You're not planning to die, aren't you?

299
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,725
But why?!

300
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,327
Is it because your master ordered you?

301
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,373
That's why, right?

302
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,529
Answer me!

303
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:08,130
They said Clayman's notorious for treating
his minions like disposable fodder.

304
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,264
Could it be--

305
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,428
Silent! If you say any more than that--

306
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:13,385
I see, so that's the case.

307
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,967
If you're prepared to die
just to follow his order, then--

308
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,404
About that...

309
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,100
Tell me more.

310
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:21,872
Youm...

311
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,654
Mjurran.

312
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,939
If you got something going on
then tell me.

313
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,107
I will protect you.

314
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,650
Are you stupid?

315
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,927
Can't you understand judging
from my look right now?

316
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:32,404
I'm a Majin!

317
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,489
So what about that?

318
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:39,334
Your race has nothing to do
with how you are as a person.

319
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:44,374
I had that hard time learning
the ruler of this country is a slime.

320
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:49,162
I love you, Mjurran.

321
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,404
Isn't it normal to want to protect
the person you love?

322
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:03,115
What you have seen of me is nothing
but an act I put on to fool you!

323
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,162
The person you fell for
doesn't actually exist!

324
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,006
Rest assured, Mjurran.

325
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,170
I will keep on getting fooled
by you until I die.

326
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:24,581
If I believe in you until the end,
then it's undoubtedly a "truth" for me.

327
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,504
Let go of me.

328
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,647
Oh, sorry about that.

329
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,428
Why are you taking the advantage
of the situation and hug her?

330
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,094
Oh, well, I thought it would
be fine given the mood and all.

331
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,678
"Fine" my ass!

332
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:40,781
Hey, this has nothing to
do with you anyway!

333
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,850
You're always trying to get a
leg on me every single time!

334
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,269
Thank you... Youm.

335
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,380
Mjurran!

336
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,059
Mjurran!

337
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,820
If it's to protect you...

338
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,622
Then I...

339
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,492
Prison Field!

340
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,814
Two barriers?

341
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,250
And this is...?

342
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:18,086
W-What's wrong?

343
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,655
I can't connect to Great Rimuru.

344
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,908
Something is interfering
with our communication.

345
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,766
Great Rimuru...

346
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,374
What's wrong?

347
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,649
You sure are not as good
as you claimed to be.

348
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,906
You got annoying moves, I must say.

349
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,720
What...

350
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,432
I can't feel any strength
in my body...

351
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:53,352
What's wrong, Miss?

352
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,867
You look like in pain to me.

353
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,503
I'm used to losing things

354
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

355
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,053
It's a blurry realism

356
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:30,100
Because it's not about me

357
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

358
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:39,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

359
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

360
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

361
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

362
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

363
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,426
If I can redo this world once again

364
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:09,806
I will paint that story with love

365
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

366
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,979
I will tell you

367
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,356
I will tell you one more story

368
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

369
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,863
I will tell you

370
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:39,377
Next Time, Beauty in Action
