1
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,323
I heard they got some pretty
monster ladies there.

2
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,323
Yeah, first come first serve, okay?

3
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:46,541
They got good woman, but I heard
they got pretty good treasures as well.

4
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:47,736
- What?
- Is that true?

5
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:48,978
Can't wait for it.

6
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,143
Damn right.

7
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:51,979
You guys.

8
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:55,916
Raising your morale is good and all,
but take a rest while you can.

9
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:59,401
Once you're done eating,
we will go back moving.

10
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,698
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,971
Give me a break.

12
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,619
So they're the ones who
killed Shion and others...

13
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,164
Doesn't seem like they deserve
any mercy.

14
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,543
I will have you be my food.

15
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,776
Well then...

16
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,923
Let's start.

17
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:47,260
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

18
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,265
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

19
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:57,020
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

20
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,939
Then it's not as fragile anymore

21
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:06,404
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

22
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:09,449
Beyond the page of the chapter

23
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,160
It's welcoming you with a smile

24
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:16,581
Whenever, as much as it takes

25
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,584
Let's start a new world

26
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:23,379
We're Storyteller

27
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,509
All the love, hope, envy

28
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,427
Even the song of despair we sing today

29
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:33,473
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

30
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:39,479
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

31
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,776
That's just sad

32
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:51,616
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

33
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:58,373
My real self, is now reborn!

34
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:03,059
(Episode 34: Megiddo)

35
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,268
Hey, look.

36
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:09,557
All troops, prepare for battle!

37
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:12,643
Stop or else we won't
show you any mercy!

38
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,026
That's my line, you fools.

39
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:16,775
Sorry.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,635
I'll have you help me vent my anger a bit!

41
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:39,315
N-Nobody said anything about this--

42
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,494
Mission accomplished.

43
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,127
Now, I hope none of my allies pathetic
enough to have trouble with these.

44
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:08,635
Dragonewt warriors! Follow after me!

45
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:10,338
Enemy attack!

46
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,487
Get to your position!

47
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:13,823
Anti-air defense formation!

48
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,893
Dragonnewts?!

49
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:17,091
There's so many of them!

50
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:20,807
My name is Gabiru!

51
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,555
No need to remember it.

52
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,580
Consider it a final gift before your death!

53
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,365
Apologies, Master Soei.

54
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,536
These people weren't as strong
as we anticipated them to be.

55
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,627
Seems like it.

56
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:54,629
Looks like the Otherworlders are indeed
in the west as Great Rimuru had predicted.

57
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,468
Tch.

58
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:05,014
Hey, hasn't anyone fled
from the town yet?

59
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,377
No enemy sighted today either, sir!

60
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:08,402
Dammit.

61
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,073
No need to rush.

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,314
There's no news from the other group,

63
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,080
and this is the only road the monsters
could use to run away.

64
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:18,510
Hmph, that better be the case.

65
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:23,039
My fists are itching to go wild already.

66
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,063
Well, I get what you feel.

67
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:33,376
That feeling you get when you crushed
someone along with their confidence.

68
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,877
It felt so good.

69
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:38,055
Enemies up ahead!

70
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:40,844
Their number...

71
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,438
Eh? F-Four...

72
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,430
That's all they got?

73
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:53,255
Tch.

74
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:54,084
Oh?

75
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,149
That geezer is still alive?

76
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,571
Well then, let's start with a bang.

77
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,587
Yeah, don't fall behind.

78
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:17,219
Good!

79
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,627
You enemy of god!
What's that sorcery!

80
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,254
Earthshatter Kick!

81
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:50,494
Awesome, they did pretty well.

82
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,759
Interesting.

83
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,998
I will be your opponent.

84
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,479
Ah, yes, Sir Shogo!

85
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:56,504
Yes, please!

86
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:02,965
There he comes.

87
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,759
We will avenge Gobzo and others.

88
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:06,446
But...

89
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:08,969
Your opponent is not me.

90
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,180
Rest assured.

91
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,969
I will give them what they deserve.

92
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,243
I'm counting on you, Sir Geld.

93
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,606
Spite how he might appear,
Gobzo is actually a very good guy.

94
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:34,121
You got lucky and survived,

95
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,852
you should've just run away when you can.

96
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:41,921
Spite how I look, I'm actually
a very sore loser.

97
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,102
And also...

98
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:47,626
I find it unpleasant to see young'uns
be so high on their horse.

99
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,751
Ooh?

100
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:50,888
You aren't talking about me, are you?

101
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:54,350
Does it not sound that way to you?
Well, my apologies.

102
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,037
I suppose your brain's just as
empty as your morals.

103
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,946
Getting slashed once is not
enough for you, it seems.

104
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:05,344
Or perhaps, you have gone senile?

105
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:16,071
Impatient, aren't you?

106
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,332
But same goes for me.

107
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:22,586
I'm already at my limit trying
to hold down my anger, after all!

108
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:28,571
What a joke.

109
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:31,079
You couldn't do anything against
my sword last time.

110
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,516
Don't get cocky, you old geezer!

111
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,852
Not to your sword skill,
but to that power, that is.

112
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,548
Space element, was it?

113
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,673
Ooh, you can tell?

114
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:44,391
Now the secret's out,
it's easy to deal with.

115
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,743
Interesting.

116
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:49,501
Then how about we fight with
our swords, fair and square?

117
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:51,876
Very well.

118
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,063
Well then...

119
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:58,657
Here I go.

120
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,360
You fool! I tricked you again!

121
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,688
What?

122
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,829
No way...

123
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:27,276
To resort to such a trivial deceits.

124
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,082
Looks like I've overestimated you.

125
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,188
What did you just do, geezer?!

126
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:34,626
I see, you weren't able to see it?

127
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,579
Then I suppose you're even less
than a second-rate.

128
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,118
What did you say?

129
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:41,907
I said less than a second-rate.

130
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,377
Don't you underestimate me,
you senile piece of shit!

131
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:49,048
Well then, let me show you
the true essence of swordplay.

132
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,704
Come, and pay close attention!

133
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:57,225
Shut up! You shitty puny monster!
How dare you acting all tough!

134
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,602
Hmph, whatever you do, it's pointless.

135
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:13,313
My Extra Skill, All-Seeing Eye allows me
perceive my surroundings three times faster!

136
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:16,993
A senile old man like you is practically
frozen in place in my eyes!

137
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,501
Get slashed and die!

138
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,594
Looks like your eyes haven't seen anything.

139
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:23,977
Huh?

140
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,061
It's about time your "All-Seeing Eye"
catches up to my movement.

141
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:32,180
Huh? What are you saying--

142
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:37,078
Crestwater Slash!

143
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:39,703
My body won't move.

144
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:41,531
No, it can't!

145
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:47,987
Eh?

146
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:50,820
My mind acceleration... still going.

147
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:58,719
It's over.

148
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,914
Make full use of your remaining
extended time

149
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,360
and reflect on all evil deeds
you have committed in your life.

150
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:20,852
Tch.

151
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,117
That's unfair!

152
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:28,211
If you're a man, fight with your bare hand!

153
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:29,813
Nonsense.

154
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,817
This is war.

155
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:37,055
Unfair or not, it is only polite to use
all power you have in a war.

156
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,383
Bullshit!

157
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:41,235
You should be ashamed fighting
an unarmed man like that!

158
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,274
You're making less sense.

159
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,047
Just kidding.

160
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,294
Sorry, I figured you might throw
that annoying shield away if I say that.

161
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,110
Well, I'm all heated up now.

162
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:55,531
I guess it's time to get serious!

163
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,196
(Berserker Special Effect: Diamond Body)

164
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,758
I will fight you seriously now.

165
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:08,102
So you better entertain me a bit.

166
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,024
Come.

167
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,094
What's wrong?

168
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,977
Is that all you got?

169
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,242
What's this?

170
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,867
You fucking shit!

171
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,266
Your physical strength is quite formidable.

172
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:40,211
But it seems rather weak against "corrosion."

173
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:42,805
Corrosion?

174
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,515
You shit!

175
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:47,017
Let me end your pain.

176
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,024
Wait!

177
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,406
Please wait!

178
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,586
You're still not done?

179
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,680
I was just about to land
the final blow.

180
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:00,867
Dammit.

181
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:02,906
What did you do to Kyoya?

182
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,922
Your friend? Here.

183
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:19,039
Dammit, why did this happen to me?

184
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,797
If this keeps up, I'm dead.

185
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:32,141
Kirara!

186
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:35,867
What?

187
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:38,086
You guys were loud, you know.

188
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,711
I just had this nice dream
about the past.

189
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:42,641
I was drinking bubble tea
in Harajuku and--

190
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,360
I'm sorry, but...

191
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:45,385
Huh?

192
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,820
You gonna have to die for me.

193
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,047
Are you joke--

194
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,496
What an abominable deed.

195
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:11,445
You have fallen that far?

196
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,774
No need for pity now.

197
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,336
You are no warrior.

198
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,274
Shut up!

199
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,000
I want to live.

200
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,500
Can you hear it? The Words of
the World has told me.

201
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,086
That by consuming Kirara's soul,
I have obtained the Survivor skill.

202
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:32,976
Words of the World... so getting new
power was what he was after?

203
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:36,543
Great Rimuru described killing an
ally as the greatest sin there is.

204
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,695
Shut up, you maggots!

205
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,711
I just have to win, that's all!

206
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:53,047
Behold!

207
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,770
The power of Berserker
that specialized in attack

208
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,295
and Survivor that specialized in defense!

209
00:14:57,327 --> 00:15:01,874
With Ultraspeed Regeneration and
All Elemental Nullification, I'm invincible!

210
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,226
Even if you break my bones or slash
my head, it will heal itself in no time!

211
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:10,020
How about that, you monster shits!

212
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:14,248
This is it! This is my full power!

213
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,086
Need a hand?

214
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:18,836
No need.

215
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,841
I don't mind fighting both of you
at the same time.

216
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,149
You seem to have confidence
in your martial arts.

217
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,595
Then let me face you
bare-handed as well.

218
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,264
Don't act tough.

219
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,344
You just want excuses when you lose!

220
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,810
Take this!

221
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,370
Let's see just how long your
regeneration ability will last.

222
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,859
Stop... it...

223
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:00,985
Stop it!

224
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,547
Stop...

225
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:07,000
Please stop!

226
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,781
I was just joking.

227
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,969
I just got... carried away.

228
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,070
Help me--

229
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:33,235
Geld.

230
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,758
I will finish him now.

231
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:42,149
I will crush your head in one hit.

232
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:49,117
I shall relieve you from that pain.

233
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,453
So you're the only one who survived.

234
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:08,985
Looks like I've misjudged the power
of these monsters.

235
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:10,914
Mister Razen!

236
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,078
You're here to save me?

237
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,406
I see, an Orc Lord.

238
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,813
Unbelievably powerful one, at that.

239
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,360
No wonder you guys were
no match against them.

240
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:24,110
Let's retreat for now.

241
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,195
I won't let you escape!

242
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:30,516
Back down, Geld!

243
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:40,586
You're sharp.

244
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:42,399
So you see through my trap.

245
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:45,399
Looks like I should be more
cautious of you instead.

246
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:49,781
You sly fox. You've been cautious
of me from the very start.

247
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,548
Not at all, Mister Kijin.

248
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:57,360
It is only natural to be cautious of that
orc lord first in terms of brute strength.

249
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,274
Well then, I'll take my leave.

250
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,664
If we both survived, we might
meet each other again some--

251
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:03,899
That won't happen.

252
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,813
Because the battlefield you will be headed
for will be attended by my master.

253
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:12,031
Master?

254
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:16,250
Shouldn't he already been defeated
by that witch, Hinata Sakaguchi?

255
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,078
He's still alive?

256
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:20,642
You have all gone too far.

257
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:25,688
You have enraged the one creature
in this world you shouldn't have.

258
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,766
I pity you.

259
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,133
Your death will not be pretty.

260
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:33,172
Silly bluff!

261
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,703
But I'll take it as a warning and
keep it in my mind.

262
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,383
Well then, farewell!

263
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:43,707
Will it be okay?

264
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,828
Letting that sorcerer get away?

265
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,878
I imagine not.

266
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:51,477
But if we fought, everyone
here would've been dead.

267
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,886
That man had already
prepared a Nuclear Magic

268
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,336
that would activate upon his death.

269
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,617
Really?

270
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:02,836
Well, it won't be an issue for Great Rimuru.

271
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,210
Great Rimuru.

272
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,676
We've destroyed all magical
devices on the outskirts of town.

273
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:31,701
Got it.

274
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,021
Return to town and stay on guard.

275
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,046
Yes, sir.

276
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:36,803
Well then.

277
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:38,138
How it's going, Great Sage?

278
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:41,201
Report. The magic formula
calculation complete.

279
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:42,951
Ready to activate.

280
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:47,138
Everything's ready.

281
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:54,403
At the very least,

282
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:59,074
I grant you the honor to be
a service for my evolution.

283
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,661
I'm sorry... you saved me.

284
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:09,607
Forget about it, Shogo.

285
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:13,037
You're a valuable combat asset
for Falmuth kingdom.

286
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,537
Yeah, I will win next time.

287
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:16,826
I will show you that.

288
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:17,959
You sure will.

289
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:19,185
Here.

290
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,107
Looks like you're already healed.

291
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:25,470
I assume it's thanks to your
newly obtained skill.

292
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:26,986
Good job, Shogo.

293
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:29,787
Let me cast a healing magic
on you just in case.

294
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,369
Sure.

295
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,357
You finally killed his mind?

296
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:42,232
Isn't it earlier than planned?

297
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,122
It can't be helped.

298
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:46,865
He's hardly useful for us at this point.

299
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:49,029
But it's quite a shame.

300
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:54,810
Kyoya's Severer and Kirara's Bewilder
were lost before it got passed down to you.

301
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,544
That's fine.

302
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,529
There's always next time.

303
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:01,740
That aside, you sure it will work?

304
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:05,148
Rest assured. This is not my first time.

305
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:10,259
Compared to my teacher's Reincarnation,
Possession is mere child's play.

306
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:26,560
Are you... Sir Razen?

307
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:30,529
Who else do I look like?

308
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,463
How many years do you think
I've served Falmuth kingdom?

309
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:42,013
With indomitable spirit and
power body combined,

310
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:45,236
I am now the strongest
Majin in Falmuth's history.

311
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:50,553
It sure feels weird to hear you
talk like that with Shogo's body.

312
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:58,450
Well then, time to report to Edmaris
and show him what I'm reborn as.

313
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:03,506
Surely I can defeat even
a Demon Lord in this state.

314
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,631
Anti-Magic Area installation complete.

315
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,634
Enemy troops can no longer
utilize any magic.

316
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:27,021
I won't let any single of you escape.

317
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:40,904
What's this?

318
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:42,717
Water... ball?

319
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:45,982
Die.

320
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:49,494
May the anger of the gods
sear through your very souls.

321
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,913
Megiddo!

322
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,113
Report.

323
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,777
1788 deaths confirmed.

324
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,628
1903.

325
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:17,553
1999.

326
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,631
2235.

327
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,402
2806.

328
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:28,381
3250.

329
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:31,303
3729.

330
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:33,381
4214.

331
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:35,037
4803.

332
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:39,750
5575.

333
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:44,841
Next time, "The Birth of a Demon Lord."
