1
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:12,625
I, the Storm Dragon
Veldora Tempest, have returned!

2
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:17,227
Anyone who opposes me will die!

3
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,640
Hey, old man.
How did you know that line?

4
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:31,913
I got bored so I analyzed your memory
and read this thing you call manga!

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,243
And also!

6
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,871
My shogi skill is now equal to that of a Meijin.

7
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:40,583
And since I'm a dragon,
you can even say that I'm Ryuo level!

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,918
(Ryuo; Dragon King)

9
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:46,898
I see, glad that you enjoyed
your time in my stomach.

10
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:52,625
I just got revived,
aren't you being a bit too cold?

11
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:57,211
But it was way faster than I expected.

12
00:00:57,602 --> 00:00:59,750
Let me thank you, Rimuru Tempest!

13
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:01,609
My sworn friend!

14
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,227
Sworn friend? That's old, man.

15
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,851
That's right, did you
receive a Gift as well?

16
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:18,969
Glad you asked!

17
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:25,295
Thanks to you, my Unique Skill Inquirer
now became Ultimate skill Faust!

18
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:28,609
This is the power that embodies
my restless pursuit of knowledge--

19
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,250
As I thought.

20
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:34,732
My Great Sage also evolved into
Ultimate Skill Raphael, after all.

21
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:35,576
Yes.

22
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:42,279
And by analyzing Veldora's residue,
you have obtained Ultimate Skill Veldora.

23
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:44,397
Also,

24
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:49,093
after using Unique Skill Unlimited Imprisonment
as a base for ability rearrangement,

25
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,197
Ultimate Skill Uriel has
been successfully acquired.

26
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,164
So now I have a total of four
Ultimate Skills?!

27
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,774
Indeed you have.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,249
So with that in mind,
I'm now invincible!

29
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,406
You can just relax and let me help you out!

30
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:06,570
O-Okay...

31
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,366
Fate repeats all over again

32
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,785
The voices of my heart say

33
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,898
Time is not enough, it's over

34
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:47,297
Belief that makes me who I am

35
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,656
Light doesn't fade away

36
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:52,632
Made my mind up now, it's better

37
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:57,985
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

38
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,930
Lured by your hands

39
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:03,492
Even if it rains don't be swayed

40
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,539
Being same as always

41
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:08,227
Want to feel my destiny

42
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:10,852
Open my eyes to be braver

43
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:14,054
Get up now Get up now stronger

44
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,461
I believe in myself

45
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,648
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

46
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:22,321
I'll never run away

47
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:26,985
I might lose control

48
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:33,164
It's a perfect world

49
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:38,687
Destroy all of it,
in the end it's for our good

50
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:41,867
Let me shout like flames

51
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,423
(Episode 37: The Visitors)

52
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,408
The outside world
after several hundred years.

53
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,353
The air is delicious!

54
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:58,767
Say, can you tone down
your enormous aura a little?

55
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,955
You'll scare off those in the town.

56
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,952
Very well, I will try.

57
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,822
Imagine like piling it up inside.

58
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,165
I see, I can do "that."

59
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,300
"That"?

60
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,755
He's releasing his aura like crazy...

61
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,836
How is it?

62
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,422
Oh, looks good.

63
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:27,883
Your aura is pretty small now.

64
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,835
I learn this from the holy sculpture!
It contains all the world's knowledge!

65
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,994
He must've tried something
he read from a manga.

66
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,831
Hey everyone! Sorry for the wait!

67
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,681
Oh, Great Rimuru! Are you okay?
We were really worried!

68
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:57,041
There was a sudden sign that
the Storm Dragon Veldora has been revived!

69
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,383
I'm actually going to explain that now.

70
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,705
But before that,
let me introduce this guy to you.

71
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,573
This guy is Veldora!

72
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:12,386
He's a little shy guy,
but please get along with him!

73
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,437
Eh?

74
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:25,735
Hey there! I'm not a shy guy in the slightest!

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,704
It's simply that there aren't many
people who could actually reach me alive!

76
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,313
Ms. Treyni!

77
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,880
Our guardian deity, Lord Veldora.

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,672
We congratulate you on your revival.

79
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:43,761
Oh, Dryads, it's been a while.

80
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,639
You did well looking after my forest!

81
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,724
Your thanks are more than we deserve.

82
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:53,396
You've kindly taken us in after we got
separated from the spirit queen.

83
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:56,440
It is a favor that cannot
be so easily repaid.

84
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,813
Don't mind it.

85
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,157
Eh?! He's the real Storm Dragon?!

86
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:08,745
You got to be kidding me.

87
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,664
I'll be counting on you to
help out Rimuru from now on.

88
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:14,040
Because I will stay here with him as well.

89
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:16,961
Hey, what do you mean by that?!

90
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,504
E-Excuse me...!

91
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,399
What is it?

92
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:23,759
May we humbly ask what's your
relationship with Great Rimuru?

93
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:25,977
You want to know?

94
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,088
Indeed, if you kindly!

95
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:30,509
Very well.

96
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:37,273
Rimuru is my confidant,
another half of my soul,

97
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,066
and a sworn friend!

98
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,680
Sworn friend!

99
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:41,720
Sworn friend!

100
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:44,485
Stop it! Now you're embarrassing me!

101
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,821
Amazing! So not only he's acquaintance
with Lady Milim but also Lord Veldora?!

102
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,885
Great Rimuru has always been
amazing since the beginning!

103
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,510
It's like anything goes at this point.

104
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:00,611
It's only natural for My Lord!

105
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:01,853
Indeed it is.

106
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:06,346
Incidentally, what is that appearance,
Lord Veldora?

107
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:09,977
This is a medium Rimuru made for me!

108
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:11,751
What do you think? Cool, isn't it?

109
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:13,758
Yes, it is very cool.

110
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,102
You think so? You think so?!

111
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,876
Now it all makes sense!

112
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:25,696
When you first showed up in front of us,
it was right after Lord Veldora disappeared.

113
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,448
I kept it a secret.

114
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:31,321
I thought it would take over a hundred
years until I can release Veldora,

115
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:35,414
and who knows what others
would do if they know about it.

116
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,610
Indeed.

117
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:39,806
Great Rimuru!

118
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,673
We're already done with
the preparation for the banquet.

119
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:44,938
Okay.

120
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,319
Everyone!

121
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:01,163
A lot of things happened,
but let's all forget about it today

122
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,859
and eat, drink, and have fun!

123
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,324
Let's celebrate the fact
that we are all alive right now!

124
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:25,386
Everyone partied hard that night
like they're in a festival.

125
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:29,175
We celebrated Veldora's revival
and reunion with those we once lost.

126
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:38,182
I received a blow!

127
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:42,909
Then I rotate my body and
deliver a punch from behind!

128
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,245
It's almost done!

129
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,220
Why am I here too?

130
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:05,171
Please taste Shion's cooking
together with me.

131
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,156
Don't get me involved!

132
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,962
It might miraculously tastes delicious!

133
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:13,798
Miracle don't happen that easily!

134
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,483
Sorry for the wait!

135
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,204
Enjoy!

136
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,876
Please don't hold back and enjoy!

137
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:31,829
Shion, do you understand
the definition of cooking?

138
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,821
Of course I do, Great Rimuru!

139
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:35,837
What do you think?
It looks delicious, right?

140
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:37,852
Why the onion is not peeled
and still has its roots

141
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,032
and the tomato still has
its stem as well!

142
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:43,688
Pull them, cut them, peel them,
there are a lot you should do with it!

143
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:47,588
Well, if I try to process the ingredients...

144
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,064
I might end up cutting it
alongside the building.

145
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,930
Huh? Not the cooking table
but the building?!

146
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:53,955
Yes.

147
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:58,860
My sword Gorikimaru can cut really well,
but it's a bit too long.

148
00:09:58,923 --> 00:10:00,587
So you cooked with that?!

149
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:01,612
Yes!

150
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,483
When I was little,
I thought nothing is impossible.

151
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,048
But it seems like I've mistaken.

152
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:11,462
Why are you looking so calm?!

153
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,704
Sword is not a cooking utensil,
do you understand?!

154
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:17,712
Can't you use a kitchen knife
or at least a regular knife?

155
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,663
Gorikimaru is my one and only tool.

156
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,206
Cheating is not an option.

157
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,707
Oh, I see.

158
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,877
And I was thinking to give you
a kitchen knife as a present later.

159
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,921
I've been mistaken!
It's all my misunderstanding!

160
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,290
Gorikimaru said he's okay
with a little bit of cheating!

161
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:34,665
I see, well, then use kitchen
knife to cook next time, okay?

162
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,690
Yes!

163
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:43,185
This cooking... well, not sure
if you can even call it one.

164
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:47,228
If you eat this every day, of course
you'd develop poison resistance.

165
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,796
I've evolved into a Demon Lord!

166
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:53,507
I shouldn't die just from eating
someone's cooking!

167
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:11,929
Delicious!

168
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,734
Why does it taste this delicious
despite how terrible it looks?!

169
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:19,529
Wh-What is happening?!

170
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:25,397
Actually, when I came back to life,
I acquired a new skill with the Gift I receive.

171
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:26,037
Hah?!

172
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:29,140
A Unique Skill called Master Chef!

173
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,538
Master....

174
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:33,695
...Chef?

175
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:38,820
With this skill, whatever I cook
will taste just as I want it to be.

176
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:41,890
I-I see, thank goodness.

177
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,195
Don't you think so, Benimaru?

178
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Yes.

179
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,851
Now I can go through this without dying.

180
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,101
Well then, let's eat!

181
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:50,843
Yes!

182
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,070
It looks terrible, but it does taste good.

183
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,140
-Good.
-Yes, yes it is!

184
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:00,960
It looks terrible, though!

185
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,601
Feel free to ask for seconds!

186
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,616
-We have enough!
-Eh?!

187
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,093
We learned something important that day.

188
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:15,679
That look of the food is also important.

189
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:25,902
Everyone, I'm sure you already know him,
but let me introduce him once again.

190
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,445
This man is Diablo, he saved
me when I was in trouble.

191
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:32,601
He's a newcomer,
but he's quite strong and dependable.

192
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:35,047
So I'll have him work
as my second secretary.

193
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,054
I wish you all can get along with him.

194
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,556
I'll greatly appreciate your further
guidance and encouragement.

195
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:42,879
Everyone, nice to be with you.

196
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,624
Teach him the ropes for me.

197
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,811
Understood.

198
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,453
-And Gabiru.
-Yes!

199
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:54,149
The development division is
in your care starting today.

200
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,111
It'll only be for the time being,
but now you're an executive.

201
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,071
-Eh?!
-I'll be counting on you.

202
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:05,187
I promise you that I, Gabiru, shall
give it my all to fulfill my duty!

203
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:08,257
Good.

204
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,208
So now I would like to tell
you guys my plan going forward.

205
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,961
It also has to do with the
Three Beastketeers and Youm,

206
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,429
so I want you guys to listen too.

207
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:17,359
We will follow whatever you say, Mister.

208
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:20,581
It has something to do with
rescuing Great Carrion, I believe?

209
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,476
I had decided to become a Demon Lord.

210
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:26,557
Yes!

211
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,518
Like I said, a Demon Lord.

212
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,570
Yes!

213
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,632
Demon Lord...

214
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,296
And you've became one.

215
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:49,329
No, I mean I'm planning to announce
to the world that I'm also a Demon Lord.

216
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:54,084
Oh, so you mean you want to pick
a fight with the other Demon Lords?

217
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,919
Yes, precisely!

218
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,756
To other Demon Lords,
but to be precise...

219
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,965
Clayman.

220
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:06,930
I see.

221
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,892
So you're planning to take
his Demon Lord position.

222
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,945
Interesting.

223
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,117
That's right.

224
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:15,814
The one behind this whole thing
is Demon Lord Clayman.

225
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,617
I have no intention to forgive Clayman.

226
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:24,281
So I told everyone my plan.

227
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,117
The clean-up of Falmuth Kingdom.

228
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,788
The need to check
the Western Holy Church's movement.

229
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:36,436
And the Demon Lord Clayman's rescue we
promised with people from Animal Kingdom.

230
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:38,352
-Rigurd.
-Yes!

231
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,664
You handle the negotiation
with the western countries.

232
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,133
My pleasure!
Just leave it to me, Great Rimuru!

233
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,510
-Benimaru.
-Yes!

234
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,512
Compile a report of
everyone's evolution changes.

235
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:51,417
To crush Clayman with full force,
we need to know how much power we have.

236
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,276
Understood, Great Rimuru.

237
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,776
-Shion.
-Yes!

238
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,271
Go interrogate the POWs.

239
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,190
Leave it to me, Great Rimuru.

240
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,818
Listen, don't overdo it, okay?

241
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,449
Rest assured.

242
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,565
That would be great, though...

243
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:06,949
Youm, Mjurran.

244
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:07,948
Yes?

245
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,743
Help Shion for me.

246
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,760
Get as much inside information
about Falmuth from them.

247
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:14,208
Let's snatch their country!

248
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,116
Just leave it to me, Mister.

249
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,464
It'll be my country, after all.

250
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,486
The Three Beastketeers, I like to
request your cooperation, as well.

251
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:26,760
It will be our greatest pleasure,
Lord of the Jura forest.

252
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,744
Just say anything,
we will follow every of your command.

253
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:32,971
Okay.

254
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:36,186
Take a rest and build your strength
for the decisive battle to come!

255
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,354
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah!

256
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:38,861
Mr. Rimuru!

257
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:43,839
We've arrived in accordance with
the Blumund and Tempest security treaty!

258
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,070
Fuze!

259
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,268
I saw many have fallen
throughout the town.

260
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:49,620
Darn Falmuth, how dare they...!

261
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,744
Eh? Well, they're not lying dead,
they're just sleeping--

262
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,674
It's not much but I brought
in 50 fully armed men.

263
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,918
All of them are fully prepared.

264
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,260
It seems like Falmuth's
main army hasn't arrived.

265
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,799
The king of Blumund promised me
that he'll send his knights--

266
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:08,151
Ah, Fuze, please pause for a moment.

267
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,628
Oh, my apology.

268
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,063
-Do you already have a strategy planned?
-Well, actually...

269
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:15,684
A strategy...
Well, rather than a strategy...

270
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,561
Is it something to keep secret from us?

271
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,229
It's not about that.

272
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,893
You see, Fuze.

273
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:27,057
We appreciate your help,
but it's already over.

274
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:30,072
Huh? Over? What do you mean?

275
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:31,862
What just ended?

276
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:34,870
Umm, I'm not sure how to say this.

277
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,065
In short, to put it simply,
I killed all of them already.

278
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,210
Killed what?

279
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,878
The entire Falmuth army!

280
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:47,128
All of them are already dead! Hahaha!

281
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,066
I understand what you feel.

282
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,344
Why don't you go to the hot spring
and rest for now? Okay?

283
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:14,289
Take the soldiers to the inn
and have them relax.

284
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:16,766
They went all the trouble to come here,
so be kind to them.

285
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,508
-Yes!
-C'mon, let's go.

286
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,889
W-Wait, can we at least talk a bit--

287
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,320
Nn? Another visitor?

288
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,610
Visitor?

289
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,985
Not to mention...

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,759
Report. 30 mounted troops
approaching confirmed.

291
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,875
They are led by
the king of Armed Nation of Dwargon.

292
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,461
Individual Gazel Dwargon confirmed.

293
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,407
-Hey, Ms. Raphael.
-Yes?

294
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:49,078
It's a pain to hear reports every time
someone comes, can you please just brief it?

295
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:50,306
Brief it?

296
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,484
Just tell me when something
hostile approaches, okay?

297
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:55,961
Understood.

298
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,235
It's been a while, Rimuru.

299
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,625
I heard you've become a Demon Lord.

300
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,045
Yeah, a lot happened.

301
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,630
To be frank, it's a hassle.

302
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,743
But we're doing a meeting to
discuss what to do from now on.

303
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:15,750
Perfect timing.
Let me participate in that meeting.

304
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,282
What?

305
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:29,985
Since when?! My Universal Detect
didn't detect them?!

306
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:30,986
Report.

307
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:35,164
No clear hostility was detected
from that group.

308
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,758
Ah, because I said it
was a pain a while ago.

309
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:39,719
Hmph.

310
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,851
I'm sorry! I'll be counting on
your report from now on as well!

311
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,149
Okay, Ms. Raphael?

312
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,172
Who are you people?

313
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,180
Well, well, if this isn't
the underground dweller.

314
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:54,539
Nonetheless, the emperor himself.

315
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,211
This is surprising.

316
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,922
To find a coward like you trying
to side with a Demon Lord.

317
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,500
Ah, it's you.

318
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:05,382
The descendant of silly elves,
obsessed with high places.

319
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,857
What makes you leave your homeland
embraced by the sacred tree?

320
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:10,201
No.

321
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:12,678
That body...
If I guess correctly...

322
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,904
Yeah, it's artificial human.

323
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:17,263
Created with a homunculus.

324
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:21,310
One ought to be cautious when
trying to approach a Demon Lord.

325
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:25,874
Oh, a successful homunculus
indistinguishable from a human.

326
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,435
Maybe I should ask them to
teach me how to make one.

327
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,506
They're envoys from
the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

328
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,592
You're still the same as always, Elalude.

329
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:36,468
Same goes for you, Gazel.

330
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,396
So, this person over here...

331
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:39,471
Ah!

332
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:43,308
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm Rimuru, the lord of this forest.

333
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,421
Let's get along--

334
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,256
So it's you?!

335
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:55,018
You bastard! Are you the Demon Lord
who bewitched my daughter?!

336
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,755
Nn? Eh? Eh?!

337
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,092
You better be prepared!

338
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,381
'O flame, burn, explode, rage.

339
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:05,365
Gather and burst, tyrannize everything--

340
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,428
Hey, what is this old man
doing all of the sudden!?

341
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,365
Report. That is a high-level
fire explosion magic formula.

342
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,904
Why is he doing that so suddenly?!

343
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:14,866
'O flame, burn, explode, rage.

344
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:16,771
Gather and burst, tyrannize everything--

345
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:20,040
You giant moron!

346
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,475
Hey, Papa! What are you here for?!

347
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:31,732
Ah, Eren-chan! You're safe!

348
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:35,264
Of course I'm safe!
I came here out of my own will!

349
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,114
Well... Sorry about that.

350
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:42,164
I got a report that my daughter was
kidnapped by a Demon Lord,

351
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,416
so I couldn't resist but to
hurry my way here.

352
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,295
Could't resist my ass.

353
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,115
You're as overly doting as ever, Elalude.

354
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:50,951
I'm not overly doting.

355
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:54,921
Eren-chan is cute, so it can't be helped.

356
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,201
In general, that's what you call...

357
00:20:57,764 --> 00:21:00,218
No, whatever I say to you,
it's pointless.

358
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,345
Mr. Rimuru, this person is my father,

359
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:06,725
the archduke of the Sorcerous
Dynasty of Thalion. Elalude Grimwalt.

360
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,897
Lord of the Great Forest of Jura
and the leader of monsters.

361
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,941
Like what my daughter Elyune just told you,

362
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,236
My name is Elalude Grimwalt.

363
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,545
Please call me Elalude.

364
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,701
I knew her parents are noble,

365
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,662
but not even I expect it'd
be someone this important.

366
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:31,029
So did you come all the way
here just to inquire about Eren?

367
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,177
Of course not.

368
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,129
Thought so.

369
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,884
I want to ascertain with my own eyes.

370
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:44,221
Just what kind of person is the one
who my daughter has grown so fond of.

371
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,262
And if you don't mind,
I'll also join your meeting today.

372
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:54,559
Why do people like them keep
coming up here like this?

373
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:04,488
With that, the important meeting to determine
Tempest's next movement begins.

374
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:17,890
The more you got hurt

375
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:22,367
That seed of hope

376
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,929
You plant on both of your hand

377
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:31,179
Will surely bloom someday

378
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:38,316
Whatever it is,
it doesn't have to last forever

379
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:41,742
As long it makes you smile

380
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:47,534
To find the meaning behind
that fleeting moment

381
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:53,593
Let's go on an journey

382
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,488
Together

383
00:22:55,513 --> 00:23:00,048
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

384
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:04,595
Above the shadow you cast

385
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:06,322
Reincarnate

386
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:14,317
The full bloom flower will paint
color on this dreary world

387
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:18,677
If you were reincarnated

388
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:23,488
I'd be with you wherever you go

389
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:26,318
Our souls are connected

390
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:32,091
I'll always by your side

391
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,169
Next time, "Man-and-Monster Summit."
