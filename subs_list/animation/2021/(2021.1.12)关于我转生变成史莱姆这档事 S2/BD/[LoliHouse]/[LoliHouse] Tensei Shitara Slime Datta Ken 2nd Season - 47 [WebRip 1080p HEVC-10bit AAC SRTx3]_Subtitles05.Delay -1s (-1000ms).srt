1
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:23,336
Fate repeats all over again

2
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,711
The voices of my heart say

3
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,874
Time is not enough, it's over

4
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:34,297
Belief that makes me who I am

5
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,656
Light doesn't fade away

6
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,500
Made my mind up now, it's better

7
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:44,985
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,908
Lured by your hands

9
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,492
Even if it rains don't be swayed

10
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,539
Being same as always

11
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:55,227
Want to feel my destiny

12
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:57,852
Open my eyes to be braver

13
00:00:57,877 --> 00:01:01,054
Get up now Get up now stronger

14
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,354
I believe in myself

15
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,580
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

16
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:09,321
I'll never run away

17
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:13,985
I might lose control

18
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:20,164
It's a perfect world

19
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:25,687
Destroy all of it,
in the end it's for our good

20
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,867
Let me shout like flames

21
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,260
(Episode 47: Epic Recovery)

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,970
That was awful...

23
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,331
I didn't call you, so why you're here?!

24
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,046
If it's to make fun of me, then go back!

25
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,006
Rimuru, why did you do
such a cruel thing to me?

26
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,414
Well, fine. Anyhow.

27
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:44,961
This!

28
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:46,977
What about this?

29
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,413
Don't give me that look!

30
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,890
Are you trying to mess with me by putting
me on hold after that cliffhanger?!

31
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:54,523
Where is the last volume?!

32
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,394
What happened to Pai and Yakumo?!

33
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:00,663
Did you really went all the way
here just for that?

34
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,760
I got so curious I can't stay still!

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,837
Or more like, he can go here
all by himself without my help?

36
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,088
By the name of Vedora, I order thee...

37
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,050
All right! Before I give you
the last volume, do me a favor!

38
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:13,570
Mm? What is it?

39
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,816
Play with Milim over there
for a little while for me!

40
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,649
Milim?

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,018
Oh, if it isn't my brother's only child!

42
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:25,154
This is the first time I meet her
in person, but she sure is still a child.

43
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,273
All right! Just leave it to me!

44
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,485
Your brother's only child?
What does that mean?

45
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,478
Oh well, now is not the time for that.

46
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:36,699
Milim is being controlled by Clayman.

47
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,785
So don't hurt her too much, okay?

48
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:41,162
Controlled? But Rimuru, I believe--

49
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,314
I'm counting on you!

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,428
Hey!

51
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,461
Good grief.

52
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:49,380
Well then, Milim!
Let's have some fun together!

53
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,700
Ranga, are you okay?

54
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,966
Great Rimuru.

55
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,345
I am fine, but we have
a little situation here.

56
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,438
What's the matter?

57
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,796
--lp me...

58
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,451
Help me...

59
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,646
Help me...!

60
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,087
I see.

61
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:11,092
It's in pain under Clayman's control.

62
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,245
All right. I will rescue you.

63
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:16,489
Ranga, grab hold of the other two.

64
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:17,976
Keep them out of my way.

65
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,041
Understood!

66
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,709
Report.

67
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:31,379
Appraisal detect the curse of domination;
Demon Dominate.

68
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,547
Remove it?

69
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,938
Yes.

70
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:51,944
Good girl.

71
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,622
Keep her safe for me, okay?

72
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,853
Understood, My Lord!

73
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,854
All left is that Viola thingy and...

74
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:09,925
Eh?

75
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,904
What are you doing?

76
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:16,220
Oh, if it isn't Lord Rimuru.

77
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:19,385
It is a pity that I couldn't
show you my work.

78
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,180
But as you can see, I have prepared
some spoils of war for you.

79
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,307
Spoils of war...?

80
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:28,599
Is this Viola that Clayman said
his greatest work of art?

81
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,576
So you defeated it without even
a single scratch on it...

82
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,601
Hey, Beretta. No offense, but...

83
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:37,236
Not sure how to say this,

84
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:40,448
but are you imitating Ramiris's
bad habit or something?

85
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:45,039
I hope it's just my imagination, but what
were you planning to do with that booty?

86
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:49,624
A-Actually, I was planning to
present these to you.

87
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,876
And in exchange for that,

88
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:57,058
I was hoping you could provide a place for
Lady Ramiris and I to live in your town.

89
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,549
A place?

90
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,761
Ramiris did say she wanted
to live in our town.

91
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,180
But why would you care
about such a thing?

92
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,681
As a matter of fact,

93
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,269
I was asked by demon lord Guy
just a while ago to choose a master.

94
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:16,067
So I promised him that I would serve
Lady Ramiris after I aided you in battle.

95
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,139
And then?

96
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:22,657
If Lady Ramiris moved to Tempest,
then I can also be there as her aide.

97
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:28,037
Which would make it possible for me to
serve you while also serving Lady Ramiris.

98
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:32,375
Uhh... You really resemble
Ramiris now, you know?

99
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,408
It is a honor to hear that.

100
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:35,947
I wasn't complementing you!

101
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:36,767
Mm?

102
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:40,127
Oh well, we can talk about that later.

103
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:44,345
Though I can't just provide you two
a place so easily, so I'll think about it.

104
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,013
Understood, sir.

105
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,349
Hadoken! Hadoken!

106
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,431
Hadoken! Hadoken! Hadoken!

107
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:53,580
Hadoken! Hadoken!

108
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:54,477
Hadoken!

109
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:56,970
Where did he learn that technique?

110
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,484
Shoryuken!

111
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:01,454
And then... Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku!

112
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,392
What's left is...

113
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,003
Is that all you've got?

114
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,384
You're far too weak to
call yourself a demon lord.

115
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:17,345
Y-You swine! Unforgivable!

116
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,517
Go! Marionette Dance!

117
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,058
Pathetic.

118
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,478
You really were nothing special, huh?

119
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,821
Don't you toy with me, you imbecile!

120
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,630
It's too early to boast your victory yet!

121
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:43,404
My Marionette Dances will recover
in no time and attack you!

122
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,727
The real show begins now!

123
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,369
So when will it begin?

124
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,462
I-Impossible!

125
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,790
Why won't they recover?!

126
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,579
It's a waste of time,
so I'll just tell you.

127
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,844
That Otachi Shion uses is a Soul Eater.

128
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:05,532
Y-You're telling me it's a sword
that can deal spiritual attack?!

129
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,345
It's not that rare, isn't it?

130
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,765
Even a human like
Hinata Sakaguchi had one.

131
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:14,375
So I took that idea, and had
one of my friends made that for her.

132
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:18,360
Is that so?

133
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:22,568
Then I shall give that dirty little blade
of yours the honor to be in my collection!

134
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,778
Take this!

135
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,488
Demon Marionette!

136
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,499
Rejoice! It's the ultimate cursing magic
that can rule even a demon lord!

137
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,289
It's a waste to use it
on a mere majin like you.

138
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,506
But I have a slot to fill
in my Five Fingers,

139
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:45,393
and you would make a fine
addition to my cache of pawns!

140
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,086
Hey, what are you trying to do?

141
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:53,975
I hardly feel anything from this.
Should I wait a little longer?

142
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,893
I-Impossible!

143
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,354
Ridiculous! This is ridiculous!

144
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:02,498
This is the ultimate cursing magic not even
a demon lord should be able to resist!

145
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:11,143
You're really pathetic.

146
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:13,744
A person relying on
such a cheap technique

147
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,002
has no right to call
themselves a demon lord!

148
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:19,494
You insolent maggot!

149
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,533
I will make you regret for
making me serious!

150
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:39,068
But yes...

151
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:42,408
Yes, you're right indeed!

152
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:45,276
Demon lord! I am a demon lord!

153
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:50,281
Which is why I focused on disposing
my foes with elegance and style.

154
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,485
But it's enough! I've had enough of that!

155
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,719
I had forgotten about how this feels
for a very long time.

156
00:08:57,744 --> 00:09:05,004
I'm going to crush you
with these very hands!

157
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:15,181
Oh? Looks like you've
grown a little better.

158
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,461
I'm glad to see that.

159
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,532
I am Shion, secretary and personal guard
to the demon lord Rimuru.

160
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,649
I shall be your opponent.

161
00:09:21,797 --> 00:09:26,150
I am demon lord... no,
Crazed Clown Clayman!

162
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,125
I shall kill you, majin Shion!

163
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:16,180
The end.

164
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:18,758
I-Impossible...

165
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:20,500
This can't be happening!

166
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,110
H-H-How could I be defeated?!

167
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,640
I am Clayman! A demon lord!

168
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:31,000
Great Rimuru, do you mind
if I kill him now?

169
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:32,672
D-Dammit!

170
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:34,760
M-Milim! What are you doing, Milim!

171
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,008
Hurry up and beat that guy and...

172
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,560
Wh-Who is that guy?

173
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,789
Wh-What is he?

174
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,821
His power is off the charts!

175
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,287
He's my friend.

176
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,110
Veldora.

177
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,289
Tetsuzanko!

178
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,045
Kamehame...

179
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:04,930
...HA!!!

180
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:09,930
F-Frey!

181
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,338
Wh-What are you doing?!

182
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,618
Get your ass up here and help me!

183
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:16,461
But Clayman, sorry to break it to you.

184
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:20,000
No one can pass this barrier
unless Guy accepts it.

185
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:22,266
It's really a shame.

186
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,016
Milim! Milim!

187
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,055
Obey my order and execute Stampede!

188
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,203
Kill everybody here within this barrier!

189
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:34,069
What?! Is this guy out of his mind?!

190
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:40,586
Why do I need to do that?

191
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,797
Rimuru and his allies are my friends.

192
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,118
Milim?! Weren't you supposed
to be controlled by him?!

193
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:03,407
Looks like I've completely
tricked you, Rimuru!

194
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,149
S-So you weren't controlled
by him from the beginning?!

195
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:16,391
I realised it from a glance, though.

196
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,164
Eh? Uh? What?

197
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:19,073
What a surprise.

198
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,914
But she didn't react when
he punched her, right?

199
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:30,668
But I used the Orb of
Domination that person gave me

200
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,837
to put you completely under my control!

201
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,058
And you killed Carrion under
my order, did you not?!

202
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,135
Ahh, he gave himself up.

203
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,613
Not only that, so there really
was someone else behind this.

204
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:46,519
Why would you think I can be
controlled by something this cheap?

205
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:53,941
Answer me, Clayman!

206
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,408
Who is this person you're talking about?!

207
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,627
So you were suspicious of him
from the beginning?

208
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,161
Then why did you--

209
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,533
Whoa, whoa, who's been killed again?

210
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,885
Could you be...

211
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,260
C-Carrion?! In such an obvious disguise?!

212
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:26,015
Ah, I feel like Raphael is being
totally disappointed in me...

213
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,518
B-Beast Master Carrion!

214
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,186
I'm glad you're fine!

215
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,023
Fine is not exactly the right word.

216
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,150
Thank you for taking care of my forces.

217
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,236
No need for thanks.

218
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,780
No way...

219
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,449
Then, you're really...

220
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,868
But according to Frey's report...

221
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:50,873
I see! So you betrayed me, too, Frey?!

222
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:55,532
Oh my, since when you
assumed I was on your side?

223
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,782
Y-You! You got to be kidding me!

224
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:02,000
A-All of you... You'll pay for this!

225
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:05,297
I will make you all pay for this!

226
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,844
-Shion!
-Leave it to me.

227
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,930
I believed you can resist his control,
but I was worried at times, you know?

228
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,978
But you still keep our promise.

229
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,055
Thank you.

230
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,812
We're friends, after all!
It's only natural!

231
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:04,696
Anyway, you've been taking
good care of that for me, right?

232
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,063
Yes, yes.

233
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:07,477
This, right?

234
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,286
Aaah, yes!

235
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,875
This is it!

236
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:18,180
Look, look!

237
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,589
So it was just a trifling farce.

238
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,571
I-I saw through it, of course!

239
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:29,094
I knew it was something like this.

240
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,150
Well, yeah, I figured...

241
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,108
Rimuru!

242
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:36,311
I'm glad to know that
you got angry for my sake!

243
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,938
Oh you...

244
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,875
But I'm glad.

245
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,922
S-Since when...?

246
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,187
Since when... were you deceiving me...?

247
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:52,327
I had a real hard time you know!
You're pretty cautious guy, after all.

248
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:56,165
That's why I worked real hard this time!

249
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,624
Hey, Raphael.

250
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,961
Could it be you also realized
that Milim wasn't in his control?

251
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,714
So you realized, huh...

252
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,758
So that's why you didn't find
any curse on her....

253
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,437
Well, I'm sorry.

254
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,039
That aside, Milim.

255
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:12,431
Mm? What is it?

256
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,836
So he wasn't controlling you
all these times, right?

257
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,109
Yes, I said that!

258
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:21,321
Then does that mean you were
beating me up for the fun of it?

259
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,487
W-Well, about that...

260
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,774
Erm, how should I say it...

261
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,078
Like...

262
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,563
Hmmm...

263
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,133
No, no, it's fine.

264
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,953
I lost because I was weak, simple as that.

265
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:42,273
But that also means that you blew up
my country out of your own will, isn't it?

266
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,875
A man shouldn't worry about
the small matters, you know!

267
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,313
It's not a small matter!

268
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,640
One wrong move and
you could've killed me!

269
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:51,539
Argh, shut up! Just shut up!

270
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:53,289
I was focusing on my act!

271
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:56,433
It was all a performance
to deceive Clayman!

272
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,610
So it's all Clayman's fault!

273
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,328
Really? You're blaming it all on Clayman?

274
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,711
Oh well, fine.

275
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,024
Anyway, the Three Beastketeers
and your people are all safe and sound.

276
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:12,366
And they did their best fighting
Clayman's force to avenge you, too.

277
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,952
I'm sure it was not all just bad stuff.

278
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,907
Oh, Rimuru!

279
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,258
Thanks for the thought.

280
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:22,282
Really, don't worry about it.

281
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,750
Besides, you can always rebuild your town.

282
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:29,539
I even had our forces capture Clayman's
majin to serve as your labor force.

283
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:31,625
Whoa, whoa, are you for real?

284
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,303
We will help you out, too.

285
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,118
Let's make a better and more
comfortable country to live in!

286
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:40,055
We also got a lot of money
from Clayman's treasure vault.

287
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,578
We really owe you!

288
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,734
Rimuru, no, Sir Rimuru!

289
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,363
I promise you that the Animal Kingdom
will prove any help you need

290
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,500
as an allied nation!

291
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,531
Good for you, Carrion!

292
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:06,430
Don't forget that it's all thanks to me!

293
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,828
I wish you could at least act like
you really regret what you did a little!

294
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,595
A labor force, huh.

295
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:18,368
I thought you were naive for
leaving those majins alive.

296
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:21,978
But I see you're a
rather creative thinker.

297
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,369
I can see why Black has
taken a liking to you.

298
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:28,166
Hmm? Black? Who is that?

299
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,057
So, Clayman.

300
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,488
I didn't intervene since
Milim was trying so hard,

301
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,220
but I was kind of angry at you, too.

302
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:41,002
We do live in the world of the fittest,
but you took a step too far.

303
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:45,674
You wrecked my country, so I would
like you pay for the consequences.

304
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,064
Whatever you do,
don't let your guard down.

305
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,369
Yeah... Laplace...

306
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,514
You were right.

307
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:05,635
You guys entrusted me with
this demon lord role...

308
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,393
Seems like this is the end for me.

309
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:20,452
Clayman.

310
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,205
You're the weakest one among us,

311
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,415
so you shouldn't do anything
reckless by yourself.

312
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,455
Yeah... Tear...

313
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,714
Tear is right.

314
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,260
Always remember to rely on us, okay?

315
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:38,424
Yeah... Footman...

316
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:40,463
You're right.

317
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,486
I forgot.

318
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,494
I just wanted to get as close as
I could to you guys...

319
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,976
I wanted you guys to recognize me as
a member of Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

320
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,291
Hey, you're Clayman, aren't you?

321
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,143
To address me so casually,
are you edger to die?

322
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:01,609
C'mon, no need to act so alarmed.

323
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:04,158
I was pointed here by an acquaintance.

324
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,706
Acquaintance?

325
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,853
By your creator, demon lord Kazaream.

326
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,507
So I'm planning to take over this world.

327
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,596
And I want you to help me out.

328
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,556
Sounds interesting. Is that a request?

329
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:25,642
Yeah, a request for
the Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

330
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,144
And what are your terms?

331
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,687
Let's see...

332
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,424
How does the resurrection of
demon lord Kazaream sound to you?

333
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:34,986
Sounds good.

334
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:41,950
Let's seize the world together.

335
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,033
It's gonna be one crazy place
for us to live in!

336
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:50,189
The demon lord Kazaream
has been revived.

337
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:54,205
But my thoughtless action led to this...

338
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:58,072
Clayman, you resemble me.

339
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:03,369
I don't mind you imitating me,
but don't imitate my bad parts, okay?

340
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,744
Great Kazaream...

341
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:08,822
I can't die.

342
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,002
I can't die just yet.

343
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,775
If I die here without
accomplishing anything,

344
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,080
I just won't be able to forgive myself.

345
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,728
I don't care if I can't turn
into a True Demon Lord.

346
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,018
So give it to me.

347
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,846
Give me power...

348
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,283
An overwhelming power!

349
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:32,572
Give it to me!!!

350
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:34,228
Confirmed.

351
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:36,931
Converting Soul into energy.

352
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:38,478
Succeed.

353
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,916
Disassembling the body
into suitable vessel.

354
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,783
Reconstruction begins.

355
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,869
The heaven hasn't forsaken me yet!

356
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:50,900
Shion, get back!

357
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:07,077
Looks like it finally began.

358
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,037
Great Rimuru, what could this be?

359
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,249
Clayman is awakening,
just as scheduled.

360
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,502
Just as scheduled?
Well, great!

361
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:19,256
Yes, everything is going
according to Raphael's plan.

362
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,424
The malice energy that surrounds him

363
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:25,220
are the remnants of souls
that he killed in the past.

364
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,013
And I'm going to release it.

365
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,642
To do that, I needed him to awaken.

366
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,102
Awakening?

367
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,813
Hard to believe, but this force
is indeed tremendous.

368
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,065
-Let me handle this--
-Carrion, no.

369
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,228
I will deal with him.

370
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,225
I declared myself
a demon lord, after all.

371
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:44,791
Let me prepare my own seat.

372
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,518
I will get rid of him and
make others acknowledge me.

373
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,708
Don't lose, okay?

374
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,119
Yeah!

375
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,629
Good luck, Rimuru!

376
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,298
Break a leg!

377
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,689
Now then, Clayman.
Let's settle this once and for all!

378
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,983
Behold! I've obtained unrivaled power!

379
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:24,752
All of you have made
so much fool out of me!

380
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:27,254
I will make you pay for all you've done!

381
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,002
Next time, "The Octagram."
