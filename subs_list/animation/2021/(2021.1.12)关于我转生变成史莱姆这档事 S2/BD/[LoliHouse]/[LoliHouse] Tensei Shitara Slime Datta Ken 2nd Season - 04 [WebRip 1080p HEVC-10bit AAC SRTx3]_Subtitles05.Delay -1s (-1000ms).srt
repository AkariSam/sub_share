1
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:08,827
After I'm done with my business
in Dwargon, I return to Engrassia.

2
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:12,891
Well then, I will now announce
the result of your final exam!

3
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:20,397
Eh?!

4
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:21,131
Could it be?!

5
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:22,852
N-No way...

6
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:25,391
It's a shame, but all of you...

7
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,758
has passed~!

8
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:33,328
Hey, don't scare us like that!

9
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:35,852
I figured we need more suspense.

10
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:37,891
Oh well, that's great.

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,180
I-I was not worried a bit, though!

12
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:43,391
Now we all can move on
to the next grade.

13
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,250
All of us together.

14
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,008
Yes, I'm happy!

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,383
You all did well.

16
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:53,555
With that, all of my duty as your
teacher is over.

17
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:59,547
Starting next semester, Ms.Tiss will replace me
as your teacher and I will return to Tempest.

18
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,445
Sensei...

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,633
Don't be so sad.

20
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:07,047
I will still be here for few days,
so please send me off with a smile.

21
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:08,921
Even when I'm back to my country,

22
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:13,663
Alice, Chloe, Ryota, Kenya, Gail,

23
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:16,281
you all will still be my precious students.

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,172
Sensei....

25
00:01:19,197 --> 00:01:19,992
Ah!

26
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,984
That aside, you better fulfill
your promise, okay?

27
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,180
Promise?

28
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:25,101
She's right!

29
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:29,258
You said you will show us the continuation
of those mangas if we get good grades.

30
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,425
Yeah, I got it all covered.

31
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,433
I will give you all volume of the manga,
including Parasite.

32
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,941
Yay!

33
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:42,760
Ms.Tiss, everyone was able to
pass the exam thanks to you.

34
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:43,753
Thank you.

35
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:46,988
It's not me, it's all thanks
to their own effort.

36
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:50,847
I can leave Class S to you
without worry starting next semester.

37
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,120
Please take care of them well.

38
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:54,386
Yes.

39
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:05,142
Look, we're finally here.

40
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:11,571
That's the country of monsters,
Jura Tempest Federation.

41
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:33,258
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

42
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:38,263
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

43
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:43,018
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

44
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,937
Then it's not as fragile anymore

45
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:52,402
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

46
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:55,447
Beyond the page of the chapter

47
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:58,158
It's welcoming you with a smile

48
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,579
Whenever, as much as it takes

49
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,582
Let's start a new world

50
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:09,377
We're Storyteller

51
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:13,507
All the love, hope, envy

52
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,425
Even the song of despair we sing today

53
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:19,471
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

54
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:25,477
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

55
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:30,774
That's just sad

56
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:37,614
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

57
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:44,371
My real self, is now reborn!

58
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:48,563
(Episode 28: The Falmuth Kingdom Scheme)

59
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:52,173
She's our new friend.

60
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,930
Mjurran the Wizard.

61
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,806
Nice to meet you.
I hope we can get along well.

62
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,110
Likewise.

63
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:00,438
Please enjoy your time here.

64
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:05,788
She's acting as our military adviser and
teaches us how to fight a magic opponent.

65
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,321
Then you must be very strong.

66
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:10,813
It's nothing much.

67
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:23,759
Are you holding a festival?

68
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:28,181
No, but Great Rimuru will
be coming home back soon.

69
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:30,431
So we're preparing to
celebrate his return.

70
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:35,401
Well then, we still have a lot
more things to do.

71
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,782
Excuse us.

72
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:40,618
And also, please come in and
enjoy the hot spring after this.

73
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:41,774
Hot spring?

74
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:44,352
It will wash all your sweats
and fatigue away.

75
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,884
Thank you very much.

76
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:55,657
So that's Kijin...

77
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:58,634
Each one of them seems to be very strong.

78
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:02,743
Well then, Mjurran.
I will show you around Tempest.

79
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,673
Here's the blacksmith's shop.

80
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,602
Weapons and armors they made
are the best in the area.

81
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:21,079
Here's the guest house.

82
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:22,626
It's awesome, isn't it?

83
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,368
Yeah...

84
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,423
Excuse us!

85
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,290
Oh, thank you.

86
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,821
Here's the delivery
of this month's high potion.

87
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,751
Yes, that would be all.

88
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:43,517
Your sign please.

89
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:45,463
Thank you very much.

90
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:48,690
I believe we will be ordering more
starting next month.

91
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:53,735
I will drop by to talk about it later,
so please tell Gabiru about it.

92
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:55,751
Duly noted.

93
00:05:57,993 --> 00:06:01,595
They're producing that many
high potion?

94
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,759
They have both the military
and technological power.

95
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,751
This is undoubtedly a threat
for other countries.

96
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:09,251
Hey, anything's wrong?

97
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:12,501
Ah, it's nothing.

98
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,767
There's a training ground nearby.

99
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:28,524
What a stupid man.

100
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:35,235
I was ordered by Lord Clayman to
investigate this country of monsters.

101
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:39,563
Youm, I'm just using you for that end.

102
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,375
What an idiot.

103
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:46,149
He didn't even suspect that
I'm actually a Majin.

104
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,212
Well then, you may rest.

105
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,712
That hurts...

106
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:03,009
The damn geezer didn't hold
back at all as usual.

107
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,438
We're beaten to plump.

108
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:07,704
G-Gobta...

109
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:13,016
That demon--err, I mean,
Sir Hakuro is always like this?

110
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,938
Yeah, that's right.

111
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,657
Beaten to plump.

112
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:19,681
Sheesh, it's not a laughing matter
at this point.

113
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,274
C'mon, stand up you guys.

114
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,540
They're doing this? Every single time?

115
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:33,181
Well, you guys are quite something
too for surviving through all that.

116
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,188
I gotta say, it makes me want
to invite you guys to Animal Kingdom.

117
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,829
Hey there, Grucius.

118
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,345
Oh, Youm!

119
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:44,727
You look horrible, man.

120
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:45,884
Shut up.

121
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:47,352
And she's?

122
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:49,376
Oh, she's Mjurran.

123
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,282
She's the strongest one
in our group now.

124
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,720
I bet even you can't win against her.

125
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:54,806
The strongest?

126
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:59,399
So you're telling me you lose
to this skinny woman?

127
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:01,642
Then how about you try it out?

128
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:05,736
If she loses, I will call
you 'Boss' from now on.

129
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,781
Sounds great!

130
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:10,906
If that woman wins against me,
I don't mind being your lackey.

131
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,141
Unlike Youm, I won't hold back
against a woman, okay?

132
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,306
Let's go!

133
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:27,782
Mjurran, let's call more people
to laugh at him.

134
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,735
And you call yourself a champion?
Hurry up and get me out of this!

135
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,274
Hey, you.

136
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,524
It's your win.

137
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,610
You're quite honest, huh.

138
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:39,243
I mean, just look at me.

139
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,696
You sure are strong.

140
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,001
I applaud you for that.

141
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,102
Didn't I tell you?

142
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:46,603
So, Grucius. About that
promise just now.

143
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:49,540
Yeah, I'll call you 'Boss' from now on.

144
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,688
Ah, well, that was just a joke.

145
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:53,665
But a promise is a promise.

146
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,399
But first, I have to tell you this.

147
00:08:56,368 --> 00:09:02,478
If Great Carrion order me to kill you,
I won't hesitate to do so.

148
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,946
I'm sorry, but it's an absolute rule
that I will not break.

149
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:08,868
I got it.

150
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,040
I will keep it in mind.

151
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:18,017
In that case, I'll join your party as well.

152
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,884
I also want to see other countries.

153
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,673
I don't mind that, but...

154
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:22,915
Are you sure?

155
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,445
My duty is to expand my knowledge.

156
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,844
I'm allowed to do whatever I want.

157
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:30,673
That battle was truly a splendid one.

158
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:31,931
Gobta?

159
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:34,125
I'm convinced.

160
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,970
With your magic, we can defeat
that geezer with ease!

161
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,823
Hey, by 'geezer' you mean
Sir Hakuro, right?

162
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,432
Do you have some sort of plan?

163
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,221
Sheesh! Too loud!

164
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:48,104
Okay, so first, with Lady
Mjurran's magic we...

165
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:52,159
Just what am I doing here?

166
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:55,314
Oh really? A mock battle?

167
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,455
Today we will have you pay
for what you've done so far!

168
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,565
Are you ready, Geeze--
I mean, Master!

169
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:04,143
What an awful taunt, to say the least.

170
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:05,891
That's the spirit!

171
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,432
I will now fight you like
it's a real battle, so be prepared for it!

172
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:12,026
The magic circle trap is already on set.

173
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:14,393
All left is to lure him there!

174
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:17,633
Well then, shall we start?

175
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:22,440
He's aiming at me as expected!

176
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,463
Liquefaction.

177
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:27,956
We got him!

178
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,487
Now, get him all at--

179
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:30,963
Eh?!

180
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,776
Where did that geezer go off to?

181
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,284
Did you just call me 'geezer'?

182
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:42,745
You got to be kidding me!

183
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,417
Why he's moving like normal?!

184
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,463
It's Instantmove.

185
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:48,276
Didn't I teach you that already?

186
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:01,198
Well then, would you like
to explain to me now?

187
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:04,971
Just what did you guys plan
to do by trapping me with that magic?

188
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:09,495
Well...

189
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,198
Ah, you're okay, young lady.

190
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:15,932
I bet these fools begged
you to help or something.

191
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:20,783
I will say this to you guys
just in case.

192
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:24,893
But don't you dare try to
'test' Great Rimuru, like this, okay?

193
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,862
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,721
It's not like this will work
on Great Rimuru anyway.

195
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:31,096
Are you sure?

196
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:34,252
He might fall into the same
trap just as easily.

197
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:37,706
Oh my, did you catch a cold?

198
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,463
No, I bet someone's talking about me.

199
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:43,034
Well, you're famous after all.

200
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,041
How about another helping?

201
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,744
Let me take that offer, then.

202
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,495
I'm feeling alive now.

203
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:56,908
That geezer will definitely won't
die even if we kill him.

204
00:11:56,933 --> 00:12:02,698
Gobta, I believe it's better to stop trying
to win up against Sir Hakuro at this point.

205
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,197
I will definitely give him what
he deserves someday.

206
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,330
Your guts really impressed me.

207
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:11,291
Though, still, that magic-user lady
sure is strong, isn't she?

208
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,072
You think so?

209
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,908
Moreover, she's a good woman.

210
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,174
I have no objection.

211
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,955
I wish she would bear my child.

212
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,260
Hey, wait, I can't allow that!

213
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,299
She's my subordinate.

214
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:25,252
Love is anyone's freedom.
First come, first served.

215
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,822
First come, first served? Got it!

216
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,088
Hey, not you too!

217
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,830
What a troublesome bunch.

218
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,088
Rest assured, Princess Shuna!

219
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:42,025
I will beat the crap out of them
and shape them up from the scratch!

220
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,221
I will help out too.

221
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:01,424
Hey, hurry up and finish that one already!

222
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,923
Just wait, okay?
I'm at the good part here.

223
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:05,884
To think it would end up like this...

224
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,572
Now that's surprising.

225
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,760
So, how about your business lately?

226
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:18,924
Thanks to you, we got a lot of quality
high potion to go around.

227
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,908
I already spread the news
to the countries in the west.

228
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,666
I'm sure there will be more
demand coming in.

229
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:27,596
And you will make a lot of profit, right?

230
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,041
Of course.

231
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:31,520
That's my business after all.

232
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,533
But please worry not, I will make sure that
the right pay goes to Tempest as it should.

233
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:39,572
Not that I'm worried about that,
anyway.

234
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:43,065
I will also be paying for tonight,
of course!

235
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,432
As my thanks for the business
and a farewell gift for today.

236
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:50,057
I'll happily take on that offer.

237
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:54,776
Baron Veryard also say
thanks to you.

238
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,651
With high potion circulating in the area,

239
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:59,722
Blumund kingdom's economy
finally get some steam running.

240
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,940
Veryard, huh...

241
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:10,854
It's good that we signed
a security treaty, but...

242
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:14,815
I've been had.

243
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,659
If some other countries were to sneak
past the forest and attack Blumund,

244
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:21,519
Tempest has no choice
but to go and help.

245
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:24,236
That's how politics goes.

246
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:28,580
But if Tempest were to be
attacked by other countries,

247
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,104
Blumund will surely come to help.

248
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,744
It's a give-and-take.

249
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,291
But Tempest getting attacked?

250
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:39,666
There's no guarantee that
nothing will happen.

251
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:45,978
I predict Tempest will eventually
become a new central location for trades.

252
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:48,729
Dorf also said the same thing.

253
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:53,775
And when that happens, there will surely
be a county that finds Tempest an eyesore.

254
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,119
For example...

255
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,924
the Kingdom of Falmuth.

256
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,815
But, well, it's not like anything
will change that sudden.

257
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,041
But there's nothing to lose
from being extra careful.

258
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,338
Yeah, you're right.

259
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:13,518
Falmuth kingdom...

260
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,166
King Gazel said that he doesn't like
the king from there.

261
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:20,697
Like he's too greedy or something.

262
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,994
The Champion Youm, huh...

263
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,571
Yes, it is said that Youm
along with his party

264
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,689
has defeated the Orc Lord along
with his entire army.

265
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,698
A Champion? What a ridiculous story.

266
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:43,729
However, we received a report about
Orc Lord from the Free Union.

267
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:47,658
So it's not all just some
baseless rumor, huh?

268
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,346
As for that Champion Youm...

269
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:53,213
it seemed like he's using
Tempest as his stronghold.

270
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,940
Tempest?

271
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,494
That country of monsters
people were talking about?

272
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,290
Indeed. With the appearance of their town,

273
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:04,759
there have been a fewer merchant
traveling past Falmuth kingdom.

274
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:07,301
Our economy has now worsen
as a result.

275
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:12,502
Because it's now possible to travel safely
to Dwargon without crossing our country.

276
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,978
This is a matter of life and death
for Falmuth kingdom.

277
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,384
If we let this country of monsters
do as they please,

278
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:23,190
the news will soon reach
the countries in the west,

279
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,776
making it hard for us
to do anything about.

280
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,779
If we're going to strike
them down, it's now.

281
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,116
However, evolved monsters are
hard to deal with.

282
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:35,909
Humanoid ones are known to be exceptionally
smart as well, making them a hard opponent.

283
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:40,385
How many men we can move right now?

284
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,541
Around 17,000 of them.

285
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:44,221
That's not enough.

286
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,026
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

287
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:53,049
Archbishop Reyhiem.

288
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:56,612
Does the Western Holy Church
have any plan?

289
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:58,463
Yes, indeed we have.

290
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:02,150
Regarding this land of monsters,
the Western Holy Church has

291
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:07,919
identified it as a threat to the heavens
and plan to subdue it.

292
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:13,879
I see, so the Church has already
certified them as an enemy of the gods!

293
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,255
However, they have yet to do
any actual harm to anyone.

294
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,068
We can move only when
a country asks for help.

295
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,271
A country that ask for help, huh...

296
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,490
If, speaking hypothetically,

297
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:39,226
say citizens of our country were to
receive any harm from this monster nation,

298
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,864
what would happen?

299
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:43,692
Well, well!

300
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:46,111
Then the Church will
surely take the responsibility

301
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:50,737
and send in the Temple Knights to
come and help fight the monsters.

302
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,943
That's reassuring to hear.

303
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:57,716
With their help, we can march
into the battle with no worries.

304
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:59,021
Very well.

305
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,885
This will be a crusade.

306
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,502
Dispatch an advance team and
cause a riot.

307
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:13,060
Your Majesty, I am thinking to send off
the Otherworlder as a display of our power.

308
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:14,896
I see.

309
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:18,435
Those freaks might be
useful in this situation.

310
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,029
However, don't let your guard down.

311
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:26,583
I've ordered them to retreat immediately
after they're done making a scene.

312
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:32,583
Your Majesty, may I use
my secret spell as well?

313
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,318
Secret spell?

314
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,224
Excuse me for a moment.

315
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,427
That's interesting.

316
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,304
Very well. I permit, Reyhiem.

317
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,122
Thank you very much.

318
00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:01,270
I promise I will bring you
the utmost of glories!

319
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:13,878
A country ruled by slime?

320
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,773
Are you making fun of me?!

321
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,112
Shogo, keep yourself down.

322
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,933
Listen until I finish.

323
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:25,081
Slime is a small fry! How the heck
one ended up as the ruler of a forest?!

324
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:28,015
Shogo does not mean any ill will.

325
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,491
Slime is famous as a weak monster
back in our world.

326
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:36,006
Regardless, you guys will
join the advance team

327
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:39,499
along with one hundred knights
and head to Tempest.

328
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:40,839
Understood?

329
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:49,534
It has been a while since the last
time we have a trip.

330
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,003
Don't make me laugh.

331
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,745
Are they seriously sending out
the army just to deal with a slime?

332
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,866
Well, if it really got ten thousand
and so monsters under its control,

333
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:59,640
then that slime should
be a pretty decent threat.

334
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,323
Yeah, sure.

335
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:04,960
Humans in this world are just
so damn weak to begin with.

336
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,991
That, or you're just too strong, Shogo.

337
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:12,702
The unique skill you got
for battle is nuts, after all.

338
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,839
Rampager.

339
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:18,722
Still, I find your skill to be
scarier than Shogo's to be honest.

340
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:22,222
Yeah. Even I find yours to be
just as ridiculous.

341
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,422
But still, damn that old man.

342
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,823
He just keeps on ordering us
to do whatever he wants.

343
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:34,010
Like, seriously, he's really annoying.
I feel like killing him one of these days.

344
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:36,417
There, there, don't be like that.

345
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:38,562
At very least, as long as we listen to him,

346
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:42,383
they will provide us the best food and
accommodation this world has to offer.

347
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,023
Huh? Yeah, no shit.

348
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:49,820
The best they have to offer is nothing
but garbage compared to our world.

349
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,616
Yeah, totally.

350
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,867
They got no fashionable stores
nor cosmetics.

351
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:56,609
No TV, no internet, no smarphones.

352
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:58,836
This world is devoid of entertainment.

353
00:20:58,861 --> 00:21:02,172
I'd be totally fine if it just
blow up tomorrow.

354
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:10,906
Shogo and Kirara looks dissatisfied,
but this might actually be a chance.

355
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:16,133
If this turns into a war, we might
get the chance to kill those who control us

356
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,891
and we can finally be free.

357
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:44,109
At the time, I don't have the faintest
clue that a crisis is approaching Tempest.

358
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,503
I'm used to losing things

359
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

360
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,053
It's a blurry realism

361
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:30,100
Because it's not about me

362
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

363
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:39,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

364
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

365
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

366
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

367
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

368
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,426
If I can redo this world once again

369
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:09,806
I will paint that story with love

370
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

371
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,979
I will tell you

372
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,356
I will tell you one more story

373
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

374
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,863
I will tell you

375
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,180
Next time, Prelude to Calamity.
