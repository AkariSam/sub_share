1
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:04,835
All of you have made so much fool out of me!

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:07,492
I will make you pay for all you've done!

3
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:20,977
Report.

4
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,352
It's believed that Clayman is looking for an opening to escape.

5
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:25,766
Figured so.

6
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,117
You're already cornered.

7
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:31,406
Give it up already and tell us who's the man giving you orders.

8
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:34,008
Impudent to no end, aren't you?!

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,242
The moment you try to dodge this attack...

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,791
He's planning to make it explode midway and escape.

11
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,084
But shame for you!

12
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,503
Beelzebub!

13
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,914
I told you, you're already cornered.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,807
He's stealing my barrier skill.

15
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:58,898
What a cheeky guy.

16
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:02,647
Hey.

17
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:05,116
If you're going serious, then get on it already.

18
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,734
You're indeed powerful.

19
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,470
I'll admit that much.

20
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:16,930
However, you have yet to witness the full extent of my power!

21
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:21,797
Do you think you can handle it?

22
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,172
Take this!

23
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,839
My ultimate technique!

24
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,612
Demon Blaster!

25
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:33,303
Engulf it whole, Beelzebub!

26
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:44,656
Impossible!

27
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:46,320
It's impossible!

28
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:50,685
That was... that was my ultimate technique!

29
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:52,383
It's useless, Clayman.

30
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:54,201
You're weaker than me.

31
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:59,406
Tell me everything you know, and I'll bless you with a painless death.

32
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:03,373
I am a Deathman!

33
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:07,013
Even if you kill me here, I'll soon be revived and come to kill--

34
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:23,641
So he cast Mind Acceleration on Clayman.

35
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,891
Well, he deserves it anyway.

36
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,180
He brought it on himself.

37
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,266
Clayman.

38
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,619
This is your last chance.

39
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,412
Who's the mastermind?

40
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,219
Don't you underestimate me.

41
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,146
I would never betray my friends.

42
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,881
And especially not my clients.

43
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:56,336
That, and that alone, is the ironclad rule of the Moderate Harlequin Alliance!

44
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,570
I see.

45
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:01,352
I should probably just tell you. You won't be able to revive.

46
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,555
Wh-What do you mean?

47
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,531
You're a Deathman.

48
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:09,272
It's obvious you're planning to run away with your Astral Body.

49
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,224
Right?

50
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:11,607
W-Wait!

51
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,943
Seems like there's nothing else I can get from this guy.

52
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,592
I'm going to execute Clayman now.

53
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:19,438
Any objections?

54
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:21,553
If you have, I'll take you on, too.

55
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,413
Do whatever you want.

56
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,094
Get him!

57
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,508
Stop it! Hey!

58
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:32,922
Stop it!

59
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,459
Don't expect your death to be an easy one.

60
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:41,154
Your last few moments before your soul vanishes will feel like an eternity.

61
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,209
You may use that time to regret what you've done.

62
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:44,516
No...

63
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,016
Stop! ...Stop!

64
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,758
Save me, Footman!

65
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:52,164
Save me, Tear!

66
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,594
I can't die just yet!

67
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,679
Not in a place like this!

68
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:59,766
P-Please save me!

69
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,160
Great Kazaream!

70
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:04,648
Beelzebub.

71
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:11,188
Laplace... you were right.

72
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:14,492
Looks like I've went too far.

73
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:19,414
I should've just stayed still, like you warned me to.

74
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:24,531
Yes... You were always right...

75
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:36,015
(Episode 48: The Octagram)

76
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:40,227
Impressive.

77
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:43,524
I hereby recognize your right to call yourself a demon lord.

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,477
Any objections?

79
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,008
I've always believed Rimuru could do it!

80
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,758
In fact, I'd be happy to take you in as my apprentice!

81
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:56,656
Ah, I have enough of that, so find yourself another one.

82
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,641
Why?!

83
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,993
What's the big deal?! Saying yes won't hurt, isn't it?

84
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:04,594
Rimuru is my besties, after all!

85
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,875
Looks like he doesn't want to get along with you!

86
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,203
No way! Rimuru, tell me she's lying!

87
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,484
Sorry, Ramiris! Seems like you aren't part of our team!

88
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,021
What did you say?!

89
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,695
There, there, easy peasy!

90
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,703
Well, fine by me.

91
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:25,320
I don't care who becomes a demon lord.

92
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,609
Just do whatever you want.

93
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:31,290
If you ask me, I would never allow a low-born slime to become a demon lord.

94
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,920
Are you insulting my friend, you lackey?

95
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,773
Hey, Milus! You really need to train your servants better!

96
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,351
Want me to train him for you?

97
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,000
Whoa?! What are you doing, old man?!

98
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,523
May I ask, what could that mean?

99
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,602
I am simply a faithful servant of the Great Valentin.

100
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:52,031
-Hmm? -Hey, don't do that!

101
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:55,578
Valentine is attempting to hide her identity by disguising herself as a maid!

102
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:57,742
So you shouldn't say that, Veldora!

103
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:59,927
She said it instead?!

104
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:05,449
Eh?

105
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,023
What a vexing evil dragon.

106
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,391
Have you really forgotten my name?

107
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,999
It's not Milus?

108
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,240
Ermm, then Smith?

109
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,670
Or is it Ils?

110
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,133
You're really well-versed in ways to aggravate me.

111
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,555
That's enough! You may call me Valentine.

112
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:34,000
As I thought, so this maid is the real demon lord.

113
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:37,398
Roy, you may return without me.

114
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:39,178
But, Lady Luminus...

115
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,210
Now my cover has been blown in front of this many people,

116
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,515
there's no point in keeping up the charade.

117
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,070
It's not like it's my fault.

118
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,984
I didn't know, after all.

119
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,679
And Luminus, yeah, that was her name.

120
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,290
Anyway, there is something that concerns me.

121
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:59,279
When Clayman looked at you, his eyes stopped for a moment.

122
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:04,925
He might be connected with the maggot that invaded my domain the other day.

123
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,742
Return home and inform others to strengthen our security.

124
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,031
Understood.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,392
That's right, I recognize the name Kazaream he spoke of.

126
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,023
It's the demon lord I killed before.

127
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:18,219
You knew about him, Leon?!

128
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,819
Or more like, why you don't know?

129
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,625
Anyway, what is it with this Kazaream?

130
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,740
Answer. The name Kazaream was uttered by Clayman as he called for help.

131
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:32,499
So how is this Kazaream related to Clayman?

132
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:34,955
Kazaream is the Curse Lord.

133
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,289
Curse Lord?

134
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,343
Milim.

135
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:41,685
It was you and Kazaream who recommended me this post, no?

136
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:47,904
Oh! You mean that guy!

137
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,977
Yes, I remember the Curse Lord!

138
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,182
He was the demon lord that Leon killed, right?

139
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,594
How did she even forget something like that?

140
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:01,564
Yes, and I believe Kazaream was also a Deathman like Clayman.

141
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,067
Those two must've been connected behind the scenes.

142
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,736
If Kazaream is also a Deathman,

143
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,657
could he faked his death in his fight with Leon and hiding somewhere?

144
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,242
That might be the case.

145
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:16,496
He was a really sharp guy, even more so than Clayman.

146
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,578
I don't really like you phrasing it like I let him get away.

147
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:23,047
I fought him simply to seize his position.

148
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,625
Whether he's alive or not, it doesn't matter to me.

149
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:31,977
Whoa there, isn't that attitude exactly what made Clayman hate you so much?

150
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,130
I couldn't care less.

151
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:38,563
Clayman has allies who goes by the name Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

152
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:42,617
Those allies of his hinted that they had connections with a human.

153
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:47,328
That human could be Kazaream who has taken a human's body.

154
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,133
You might be correct.

155
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:53,779
Leon's attacks could destroy even his opponent's very spirit.

156
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:57,773
Surviving that is a feat worthy of praise.

157
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:00,898
Even so, it's weird he'd resurrect this fast.

158
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,305
So there's a high chance someone is assisting him?

159
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,865
Precisely.

160
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,133
Well, anyway,

161
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:13,386
I'll assume he's alive and be on guard for him.

162
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,414
I bet he would hold some grudges on me for killing Clayman--

163
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:22,412
Rimuru, you're much stronger than he was back then.

164
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,725
So there's no need to worry about him!

165
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,888
It's that way of thinking that lead to defeat!

166
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,047
That's right, I must be on high alert.

167
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:35,107
It's not just about me,

168
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:38,576
I have friends now who I need to protect.

169
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:49,839
Well then, so the subject for today's meeting.

170
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,109
It was about Carrion's betrayal and the rise of Rimuru over here.

171
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:55,898
But the issues has been settled.

172
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,563
Anyone else has something to say?

173
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,867
May I?

174
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:07,063
I have a proposal, or rather, a request.

175
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,090
Go ahead.

176
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:12,070
Starting now, I've decided to serve Milim.

177
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:12,977
Eh?!

178
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:13,977
Eeeh?!

179
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,172
What did you say?

180
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:20,461
As such, I would like to relinquish my position.

181
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,453
Whoa, that's kind of sudden, isn't it?

182
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:26,070
Wait, Frey! I didn't hear anything about that!

183
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,312
Yes, because I didn't tell you.

184
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,078
Well, I have my reasons.

185
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,266
But more than anything, I believe I'm too weak to be a demon lord.

186
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,641
I realized that after I watched that battle earlier.

187
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:46,047
Had I fought Clayman, I'd be lucky to even match him.

188
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:50,430
And I would stand no chance against him in his awakened state.

189
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,086
But, Frey.

190
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:56,148
You specialize in high-speed areal combat, do you not?

191
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,742
I see no reason for you to depreciate yourself like this.

192
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,977
Yes, I would have the advantages if we fought in the sky.

193
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,873
But I know quite well

194
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,251
that just having advantages can only get you so far.

195
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:13,406
Besides, it's not like Milim can afford only thinking about herself forever, can she?

196
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:18,011
Isn't it about time you actually think about managing your own domain?

197
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,222
What do you think? Will you accept my offer?

198
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:25,059
Eh? But, I'm not really the type to keep a citizenry to rule over...

199
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,789
So, how should I say it...

200
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:28,250
Hold on a second.

201
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,336
I got something to say about that, too.

202
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:35,111
As you know, I lost to Milim in a one-on-one match.

203
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,078
So I would like to accept my defeat and submit to her.

204
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:44,120
As such, I'll now work under you.

205
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,961
Great to be on the team, Boss!

206
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,867
Hold it right there, Carrion!

207
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,773
I only fought you because I was under mind control!

208
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,460
No! I don't know anything about it!

209
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:54,195
Don't you play dumb with me!

210
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,216
We all hear you say,

211
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:58,515
"You think I can be controlled by something this cheap?"

212
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,633
All loud and clear!

213
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:03,141
W-Well, about that...

214
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,593
Well, you can just ignore that muscle-head idiot for now.

215
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:08,406
You will accept my offer, right, Milim?

216
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:13,250
Y-You say all that, but you're trying to trick me, aren't you?

217
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,275
Trick?

218
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,527
If you become my subordinate,

219
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,030
we can't have casual chat anymore, right?

220
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,766
You won't play with me and think of fun schemes with me anymore, right?

221
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:26,352
No, we'll get to be together every day.

222
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:29,289
And I'm sure we'll be able to find more fun stuff to do together.

223
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:31,930
And besides,

224
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:35,380
this all happened because you blew up my entire country.

225
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:38,125
So you better take the responsibility to take care of the aftermath.

226
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:47,734
Fine! Just do whatever you want!

227
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,759
All right!

228
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,586
Are you really sure about that?

229
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:54,516
I've been thinking a lot about it, too.

230
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,944
Of course, I'll still stay as the king of the Animal Kingdom.

231
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,453
I just want to build a new structure with Milim at the top of it.

232
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,531
I like you quite a lot, you know?

233
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:09,869
I was expecting you to awaken in another hundred years or so.

234
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,750
Very well.

235
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,898
From this moment, Frey and Carrion are no longer demon lords.

236
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:20,047
You two may serve Milim as you wished.

237
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:35,588
That means... ah, right.

238
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,564
It's the Ten Great Demon Lords, but there are only eight of us left.

239
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,334
This is a concern.

240
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:46,910
To maintain our dignity, we need to come out with a new name.

241
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:50,955
Fortunately, we're right in middle of Walpurgis.

242
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:55,580
We have all demon lords here, so it's a wonderful time to brainstorm.

243
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:58,283
It was a real mess the last time, after all.

244
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:02,884
We ended up having to hold Walpurgis multiple times just to decide on a name.

245
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:07,197
You guys really held Walpurgis for such a mundane reason?!

246
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,549
Do demon lords have nothing better to do?

247
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:11,385
Oh, you guys are talking about names?

248
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,603
Then my friend Rimuru is great at it!

249
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:19,108
Yeah, yeah! He came out with Beretta's name in no time!

250
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,307
Yes! Great Rimuru is a master at giving names!

251
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:29,846
Rimuru, today you stand as a new demon lord.

252
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,525
I would like to grant you a wonderful privilege.

253
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,750
Ah, I don't need it. Thank you very much.

254
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,318
Yes.

255
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:50,348
I will now grant you the right to provide us with a new name.

256
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,497
Eh?

257
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,733
It is a very honorable position.

258
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:58,264
So you will accept it, yes?

259
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:05,333
And also, this all happened because you culled out our numbers, you know?

260
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:10,075
So you will take the responsibility and come out with a name, yes?

261
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,278
Sheesh, all right.

262
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,607
Good grief.

263
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:17,411
Just don't complain if you don't like the name, okay?

264
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,692
Wonderful!

265
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,896
There's eight of us, so how about "Eight Great Demon Lords"?

266
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,942
Ah, but maybe it's a bit too cheap.

267
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:40,614
The stars...

268
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,150
Eight people...

269
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,901
The number eight...

270
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,974
Eight stars...

271
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,778
Eight-pointed stars...

272
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,044
Eight-pointed stars, what was it called? Octagram?

273
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:58,607
The Eight-Star Demon Lords; Octagram.

274
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:00,021
What do you think?

275
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,809
Good! We can win with this!

276
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:13,364
It's the beginning of a new era!

277
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,630
Told you! I knew Rimuru could pull it off!

278
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,224
Impressive. I can see why Veldora recommended you.

279
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:23,534
Hmph, so be it.

280
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,573
Seems like you do have potential.

281
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:27,888
Whoa! Just like that!

282
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,888
Then what was all that trouble we went through last time?

283
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:32,306
No objection.

284
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,995
Very well.

285
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,989
The Eight-Star Demon Lords, Octagram.

286
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,771
Well then, once again.

287
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:52,458
Allow me to introduce the Eight-Star Demon Lords, Octagram.

288
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,411
Demon, Lord of Darkness.

289
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,692
Guy Crimson.

290
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,513
Pixie, Labyrinth.

291
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,083
Ramiris.

292
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,099
Dragonoid, The Destroyer.

293
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,903
Milim Nava.

294
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:10,138
Giant, Earthquake.

295
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:11,849
Daggrull.

296
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,952
Vampire, Queen of Nightmare.

297
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,926
Luminus Valentine.

298
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,653
Fallen, Sleeping Ruler.

299
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:22,966
Deeno.

300
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,927
Demonoid, Platinum Saber.

301
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,192
Leon Cromwell.

302
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:32,435
Slime, Newbie.

303
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,700
Rimuru Tempest.

304
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:37,122
That concludes all.

305
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,433
Congratulation on the establishment of Octagram.

306
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,862
Congratulation.

307
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,487
Congratulation, Great Rimuru!

308
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:56,785
And thus, I became a member of the eight demon lords; Octagram.

309
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:02,347
That day, we opened the curtain on a new era of demon lords.

310
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,964
Demon lord Valentine is absent thanks to Walpurgis.

311
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,956
Now is the perfect time to find out Holy Emperor's identity.

312
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,790
Is it the Holy Emperor?

313
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,814
No..

314
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,392
It's Hinata Sakaguchi!

315
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,235
To sneak into this sacred place.

316
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,628
This is why I hate cockroaches.

317
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:35,932
What the hell?! What's going on?!

318
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:39,182
Wasn't President supposed to lure Hinata out?!

319
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,893
This is not what they told me!

320
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,794
Valentine being absent is nice and all,

321
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,175
but it means nothing if that woman is here!

322
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,081
How am I supposed to win against a monster like her?

323
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:59,331
Are you serious?!

324
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:01,909
Sheesh, I'm so done with this.

325
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,925
You puny insect.

326
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,268
How dare you show yourself in front of me for a second time.

327
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:09,784
Demon lord...

328
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:12,097
You insects all think the same.

329
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:14,445
Do you louts love running around that much?

330
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,768
What are you talking about?

331
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:18,870
Clayman just died a while ago.

332
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,073
What did you say?

333
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:27,124
That foolish, sniveling little maggot was running for his life, just like you.

334
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,586
All while mewling pathetically the whole time.

335
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,221
What are you so angry about?

336
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:36,214
What does it matter to you?

337
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,597
Shut it!

338
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:41,024
Hey, did Clayman really die? For real?

339
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:45,331
The maggot just let the cat out of the bag!

340
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,940
I knew you two were connected.

341
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,956
All by the will of the great Luminus.

342
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:54,050
What are you laughin' about, you bastard?!

343
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,276
Who do you think you--

344
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:57,698
Dumbass!

345
00:19:57,723 --> 00:20:02,495
I told you! Don't you dare! Laughing at! My friend!

346
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,667
Don't you get ahead of yourself!

347
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,565
You puny insect!

348
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,518
Die! Bloodray!

349
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,472
It won't activate?!

350
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:20,612
It's useless.

351
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:22,331
You're already dead.

352
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,823
You guess right. This is your core.

353
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:38,713
You're a tidbit too late on the uptake there.

354
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,440
That's right, I'm strong.

355
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,479
Aaah, Footman ain't gonna like this.

356
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,802
Aah, and Tear will probably cry.

357
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,893
Which is why, I'll laugh.

358
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,932
Clayman...

359
00:21:07,957 --> 00:21:11,062
...You're really such an idiot.

360
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:26,355
The more you got hurt

361
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:30,832
That seed of hope

362
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:35,394
You plant on both of your hand

363
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:39,644
Will surely bloom someday

364
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,655
Whatever it is, it doesn't have to last forever

365
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,207
As long as it makes you smile

366
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:52,771
To find the meaning behind that fleeting moment

367
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:54,198
It's finally over.

368
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,464
Yes! Good job, sir!

369
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,765
Aaah, I'm all beat.

370
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,198
Real tired.

371
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:02,503
But you didn't even do a thing.

372
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:05,010
Rimuru! Hurry up!

373
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:08,051
Yeah, the last volume, right? I hear you, okay?

374
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,723
Good grief, you guys are just so free.

375
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:15,752
Great Rimuru!

376
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,347
Everyone is waiting.

377
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,399
It's time, Lord Rimuru, Lady Ramiris.

378
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,862
Let's go.

379
00:22:50,963 --> 00:22:55,165
I was supposed to have a fairly normal uneventful life.

380
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,750
But I was stabbed by some random assailant

381
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,573
and got reincarnated here as a slime.

382
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,886
And I built a country of monsters.

383
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,229
I rescued my friends.

384
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:13,972
Defeated my enemies.

385
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,854
And finally became a member of the Octagram

386
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,300
as one of the eight demon lords.

387
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,768
My name is Rimuru Tempest.

388
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:25,853
A simple slime.
