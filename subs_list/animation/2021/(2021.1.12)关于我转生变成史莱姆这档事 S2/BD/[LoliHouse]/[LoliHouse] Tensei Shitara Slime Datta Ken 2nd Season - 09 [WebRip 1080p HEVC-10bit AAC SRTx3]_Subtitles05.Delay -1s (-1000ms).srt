1
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:05,789
Sorry for keeping you all waiting.

2
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:07,719
The meeting now starts.

3
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:12,320
Our topic for today is about our approach towards humans from now on...

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,859
...and resurrection of Shion and others!

5
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:34,276
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

6
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:39,281
So that it won't freeze from the coldness of solitude

7
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:44,036
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

8
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:46,955
Then it's not as fragile anymore

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,420
Like how you paint color on a transparent body

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,465
Beyond the page of the chapter

11
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,176
It's welcoming you with a smile

12
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,597
Whenever, as much as it takes

13
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,600
Let's start a new world

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,395
We're Storyteller

15
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:14,525
All the love, hope, envy

16
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:16,443
Even the song of despair we sing today

17
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,489
It will all be a seed and bloom, into a strong person

18
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:26,495
Why does salvation born from someone's tear

19
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:31,792
That's just sad

20
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:38,632
Ideal and fantasy, all mixed up by youthful impulse

21
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:45,389
My real self, is now reborn!

22
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,988
A story about a certain girl and a dragon. (Episode 33: With Everything)

23
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:57,156
Her parents were a dragon and a human, and she was raised as a Dragon Princess.

24
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:03,906
One day, her dragon father made a small copy of himself

25
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,266
and gave it to his daughter to be her friend.

26
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,297
However...

27
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:13,844
The small dragon was killed by a king who wanted to take over the Dragon Princess.

28
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:19,789
The girl grieved, mourn, and raged.

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,132
With the power she inherited from her father,

30
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:29,515
she killed the king, several hundred thousand of his people, and finally his whole country.

31
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:33,984
After that, the girl evolved into a Demon Lord,

32
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:38,531
and following that, the small dragon was miraculously resurrected.

33
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,703
But...

34
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,781
The small dragon had already lost its soul after its death.

35
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:49,172
It is now nothing but an evil monster who would destroy everything on its path.

36
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:51,672
A Chaos Dragon.

37
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,336
The girl once again mourns, and seals the dragon who was once her friend.

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,461
This tale was the start of the Dragon Princess who now became a Demon Lord.

39
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:10,781
As such, I would like to become a Demon Lord.

40
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:18,866
What?! Great Rimuru becoming a Demon Lord?!

41
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,304
- Psst! - Sorry.

42
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:24,656
The Falmuth's army is heading this way...

43
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:32,795
...so I'm going to eat over ten thousand of them and evolve into a Demon Lord.

44
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:40,793
There is a three percent chance we can resurrect Shion and others.

45
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,738
B-But, Great Rimuru...

46
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,964
Wait.

47
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,652
I'm sure you have a lot to say and ask.

48
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:56,529
But I want you to listen until I'm finished.

49
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,394
Understood.

50
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:02,918
I'm a former human, a Reincarnator.

51
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:07,558
In other words, I came from the same world as the Otherworlder.

52
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,836
I died back in that world.

53
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:27,855
And was reborn in this world.

54
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,808
As a slime, that is.

55
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:41,777
I was lonely at first, but...

56
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,332
Later, I made friends.

57
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,308
And comrades.

58
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,613
It's you guys.

59
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,566
People I can call a family.

60
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:49,832
People that are precious to me.

61
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,526
I used to be a human,

62
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:02,722
that's why that I said I love them and made a rule to not harm them.

63
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:07,324
I'm a monster, but I thought I was still a human at heart.

64
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:12,082
That's why I thought it would be nice to become friends with humans, too.

65
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:15,621
It's already too late to regret about it now.

66
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:19,207
And I didn't want you guys to be hurt from it.

67
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:27,129
If only I hadn't stayed for too long in Engrassia...

68
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,832
No.

69
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:30,347
This is not your fault.

70
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:35,441
We were too dependent on you to protect us.

71
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,754
And that weak thinking led to this tragedy.

72
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:43,511
It pains me as a brother to have my sister say it before I could.

73
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,699
This has been an excruciating lesson for me.

74
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:50,497
When I lost contact with you because of the barrier,

75
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,908
that feeling of invincibility I always had, crumbled.

76
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:56,840
It made me feel helpless deep in my heart.

77
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,955
You have entrusted me to take care of the town.

78
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,371
So it is my fault for not being able to prevent this from happening.

79
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,457
Wait a moment, Benimaru!

80
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:08,417
If you're saying that, then it should be my fault as the head of security.

81
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:10,152
I'm the one at most fault!

82
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:10,949
No.

83
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:11,838
Nnn?

84
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:15,936
I should've paid more attention to those who pass the street for the first time.

85
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,168
Eeh?

86
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:18,574
It's my fault.

87
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:22,137
I might've taunted the enemy too much.

88
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,762
Well, that can't be helped.

89
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:26,129
Wait, wait, wait!

90
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:28,887
I'm the one who let my guard down.

91
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:32,238
We all end up like this because I prioritized my own personal affairs.

92
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,504
It's all my responsibility.

93
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,066
I'm really sorry.

94
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:39,449
Great Rimuru...

95
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,363
Great Rimuru.

96
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:51,207
There is absolutely no problem in prioritizing your own desire.

97
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:56,574
It was our own carelessness and weakness that caused this tragedy.

98
00:07:57,035 --> 00:08:02,658
We let those brutes pillage in because of our negligence.

99
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,613
Am I wrong, everyone?

100
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:10,605
You guys...

101
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:12,201
Great Rimuru.

102
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:15,543
You're our one and only master.

103
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:18,582
Be it being friends with humans or becoming a Demon Lord,

104
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,211
whatever path you take, it is also ours to walk through.

105
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:26,011
Don't you hate having a former human like me as your master?

106
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,855
But you're still you, right, Great Rimuru?

107
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,435
Well, that is true...

108
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:36,910
The person we serve is you, Great Rimuru.

109
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,855
It doesn't matter what you were in your previous life.

110
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:40,949
That's right.

111
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,316
We all share the same feeling.

112
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:49,894
No one here has any problem with that.

113
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,121
We would simply follow your order.

114
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,894
Really?

115
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:59,862
- That's right! - You bet! - Yeah! - Of course!

116
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,277
So, I would like to ask...

117
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:13,191
How are you planning to interact with humankind from now on?

118
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:14,902
Yeah.

119
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:19,105
From what I believe, humans can become either good or evil.

120
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:22,378
Which will they be depends on their nature as a person,

121
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:25,238
but it can change drastically depending on their environment.

122
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:27,957
Even if they're a good person as an individual,

123
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:32,348
if the country they live in walks on the path of evil, they too will follow suit.

124
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:38,043
That's why I want to make an environment where humans can learn.

125
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,457
That we can be a good neighbor if we know each other better.

126
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:46,621
That it will help us both to cross the barrier between races.

127
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,433
I want to believe in that possibility.

128
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:55,332
But still, that is just a hope for the future.

129
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,473
It's still too early for that.

130
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,668
First, we need humans to acknowledge our presence.

131
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,230
I see.

132
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:07,301
With Great Rimuru turning into a Demon Lord,

133
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:10,019
they will know that negotiation by force is unfavorable.

134
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,301
Yeah.

135
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:14,653
On top of that, I will be there to keep other demon lords in check,

136
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:18,794
serving as a shield for other human nations.

137
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:23,418
If they are smart, other nations will surely choose to coexist.

138
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:24,871
That's right.

139
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:30,082
We're aiming to build a friendly relationship in the long run.

140
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,652
That's my proposal.

141
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:39,433
That is quite an idealistic thought.

142
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,980
It's not what you expect from someone who's about to become a Demon Lord.

143
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:43,887
Sheesh.

144
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,949
But I like that.

145
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:48,730
It's just so like you.

146
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,262
Nothing's wrong with being idealistic.

147
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,824
I believe Great Rimuru can make it.

148
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,308
Such a dream-like world.

149
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:01,328
There's no need to overthink about it.

150
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,965
All we have to do is to believe in Great Rimuru.

151
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:06,750
If you do become a Demon Lord,

152
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,598
don't forget to give me job to do, okay?

153
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,629
We're Great Rimuru's loyal shadow.

154
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,840
We will move according to your orders.

155
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:15,769
Indeed.

156
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:17,949
And of course, we too!

157
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,301
Thank you guys.

158
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:20,980
My Lord.

159
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,207
I am your loyal fangs.

160
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,855
The one who will tear apart any foe who stands in your path.

161
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:27,316
Ranga...

162
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,598
Sheesh.

163
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,401
And you want us to build a new nation

164
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,070
and help you improve monsters' image, right?

165
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,707
You know me well, Lil' Youm!

166
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:40,746
Ah, shove it.

167
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:45,457
Rimuru.

168
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,902
Let's be friend, too, from now on!

169
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:48,754
Yeah.

170
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:51,105
Yes, of course.

171
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,418
Thank you everyone!

172
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:56,191
Please put out with my selfishness from now on, too!

173
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,715
- Yes! - Of course!

174
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,332
- Yay! - Let's do it!

175
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,254
I'm glad.

176
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:07,816
This is indeed my home.

177
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:11,299
Boundaries between human and monsters

178
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:14,348
can surely be crossed if we look at each other properly.

179
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,042
I am certain of that.

180
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:24,058
Well then.

181
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,488
What do we know about the army?

182
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:27,348
Yes.

183
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,769
According to Soei's report,

184
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:33,963
if they're going at this pace,

185
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,370
the marching army will arrive at Tempest in three days.

186
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,480
Ten thousand of Falmuth's knights.

187
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,253
Six thousands of mercenary.

188
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:49,980
Around a thousand of mages.

189
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:55,801
Lastly, three thousands of Western Holy Church's Temple Knights.

190
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,801
That would be all of their allied force.

191
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:00,988
So there are a total of twenty thousands of them...

192
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:04,512
There are a lot of them, but it's not much of a big deal.

193
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:05,410
No problem.

194
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:08,122
As we expect from you!

195
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:10,379
Twenty thousands.

196
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:13,887
It's enough nutrient for me to evolve into a Demon Lord.

197
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:21,168
I will likely evolve into a "True Demon Lord" by consuming this many human souls.

198
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:22,918
How should we allot our forces?

199
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:23,783
Nnn?

200
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:26,918
My unit should address the main enemy presence.

201
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,840
Please let us Goblin Rider to be the vanguard.

202
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:33,418
I'm sorry but I want you guys to let me handle the allied force alone.

203
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:34,215
Eh?

204
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:35,855
There is a reason.

205
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:38,793
It's related to resurrection of our fallen friends,

206
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,527
and to do that, I need to become a Demon Lord.

207
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:49,831
And to become one, I need to annihilate all the invaders by myself.

208
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,254
I see...

209
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:57,691
But still, isn't it too dangerous for you to go fight on your own?

210
00:13:57,716 --> 00:13:59,058
Don't worry.

211
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,613
I won't let my guard down and I won't hold back either.

212
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:03,418
I-Is that so...

213
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,613
There is another reason...

214
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,215
I need to take the responsibility for what happened.

215
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,996
I mustn’t let myself take it easy from now on.

216
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:24,973
Understood.

217
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,840
We will leave it all to you.

218
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:32,816
And so, I would like you guys handle something else.

219
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,637
Yes!

220
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:34,707
We will do anything!

221
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:41,605
There are magical devices in all four cardinal directions of our town, generating the barrier.

222
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:45,465
Each is being guarded by a company of knights.

223
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:49,605
I want you guys to attack and take them all down simultaneously.

224
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,660
Oh?

225
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:54,043
Then we need to decide which unit to deploy.

226
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:55,813
Please let me-

227
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:56,941
Me too!

228
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:59,191
I'm dead serious this time.

229
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,324
No need to rush.

230
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:01,723
I already picked the personnel.

231
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,176
First, Benimaru will tackle the east.

232
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:11,637
Hakuro, Rigur, Gobta, and Geld will handle the west.

233
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,637
The south will be handled by Gabiru and his men.

234
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,168
And on the north is Soei and his fellows.

235
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:22,824
Thank you for providing us with the opportunity.

236
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,199
Just leave it to us!

237
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:27,918
Can you win?

238
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:29,638
It's an easy feat.

239
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,848
Good.

240
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,027
Benimaru.

241
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,976
Not that I'm worried about your skill,

242
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:37,104
but you will be operating solo against nearly a hundred knights.

243
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,808
If you sense any danger...

244
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,355
Rest assured.

245
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,176
There is no need to hold back this time.

246
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:46,738
Then the more reason you don't have to worry.

247
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:51,308
Great Rimuru, I have no intention in letting my guard down the second time.

248
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:55,332
And considering you put me on the west team...

249
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:04,816
...that means there's a high chance they will be there, is it not?

250
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,215
Yeah.

251
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,457
I'm sure they're blocking the path to Blumund.

252
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:12,151
That should be where their strongest troops are at.

253
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:16,449
There is a high chance that the attackers are Otherworlder like me.

254
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:20,168
Not a problem by any means.

255
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:23,848
I lost due to my own negligence.

256
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:27,848
But I had already seen through his attacks.

257
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,214
Okay, I'm counting on you.

258
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,808
Great Rimuru!

259
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,168
We're not as weak as we were before!

260
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:38,215
We have the power to fight, not just to be protected by Sir Hakuro.

261
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,441
That's right!

262
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,644
We're going to avenge Gobzo!

263
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:47,683
I promise you I will make full use of this power you bestow me as an Orc King.

264
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,824
That's assuring.

265
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:54,306
Let's destroy the magical devices and get rid of this annoying weakening barrier!

266
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,512
Yes, sir!

267
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:57,113
Shuna.

268
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:57,855
Yes.

269
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:03,488
There is a chance this annoying barrier is what keeping everyone's soul within our reach.

270
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,058
You understand?

271
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:06,129
Yes.

272
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:08,863
You want me to put on another barrier on its place, right?

273
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,488
That's right.

274
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:11,722
Leave it to me.

275
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:15,793
I will do my best to keep the chance of their resurrection at an all-time high.

276
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,426
And about that.

277
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,660
Mjurran.

278
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:21,777
I want you to lend us your strength.

279
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,691
Please help Shuna.

280
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:25,347
Understood.

281
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:30,121
To atone for my mistake, I will surely fulfill your expectation.

282
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,613
Pleased to work with you, Mjurran.

283
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,629
Yes, likewise.

284
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:37,316
Then we will be their bodyguard.

285
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,190
Yeah.

286
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:41,340
We will protect Shuna and Mjurran, too!

287
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,293
Yeah!

288
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:43,441
Leave it to us!

289
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,026
Rigurd.

290
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:48,026
I'm leaving you in command.

291
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:48,965
Yes!

292
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,785
The allied force must be assuming the battle will start in three days.

293
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:58,004
But, starting this moment, we will start our attack on them!

294
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,090
We will resurrect Shion and others!

295
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:27,560
Comrades...

296
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,396
Friends...

297
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:31,732
Family...

298
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,545
What a good thing to have.

299
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:38,412
Well then, time for me to prepare.

300
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,373
Could it be...

301
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:50,537
Clayman's goal is actually those ten thousand human souls?

302
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:58,045
He used us to trigger a war to harvest a huge amount of souls at once.

303
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:03,451
So that he can evolve into a "True Demon Lord."

304
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:12,014
If that's the case, then Clayman is nothing but a small fry for me.

305
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:13,803
But...

306
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:16,902
I already consider him as my enemy.

307
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:21,356
After this is done, next is...

308
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:30,199
Sir Gabiru!

309
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:32,645
Hey!

310
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,442
Oh, it's you guys!

311
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:37,537
Great Rimuru let us get outside the barrier.

312
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:40,100
I see, good things you guys are safe.

313
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,834
You too, Sir Gabiru!

314
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:43,521
We're glad you're safe!

315
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:46,459
Ah! You guys!

316
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:53,732
We might be born at different time, but we will die together!

317
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,795
Sir Gabiru!

318
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,295
You guys!

319
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,443
Are you done?

320
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:02,404
Yeah.

321
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:04,404
Time to go.

322
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,350
Oooh.

323
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,287
Well then, my men! Are you ready?!

324
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,896
Time to show them the power of the Dragonewt!

325
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,607
Let's get moving!

326
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:27,826
Sir Gabiru, so cool!

327
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,060
Indeed he is!

328
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:31,146
Okay, let's follow him!

329
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,130
So they're the ones who killed Shion and others...

330
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,965
Doesn't seem like they deserve any mercy.

331
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,794
I will have you be my food.

332
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,496
Well then...

333
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,363
Let's start.

334
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,503
I'm used to losing things

335
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

336
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,053
It's a blurry realism

337
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:30,100
Because it's not about me

338
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,188
The nameless sadness disappears, warped in a legato-like dream

339
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:39,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

340
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

341
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

342
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

343
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,088
I wish that someone is you (I'll tell you one more story)

344
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,426
If I can redo this world once again

345
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:09,806
I will paint that story with love

346
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

347
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,979
I will tell you

348
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,356
I will tell you one more story

349
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

350
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,863
I will tell you

351
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,085
Next time, "Megiddo."
