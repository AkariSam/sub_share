1
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:05,016
Around the time the Tempest force is fighting Clayman's army.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,961
We're preparing ourselves for Walpurgis.

3
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:12,836
It looks great on you, Great Rimuru!

4
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,687
Yes! You look wonderful!

5
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:18,219
Dignified look befitting to one such as you, My Lord!

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,438
Y-You think so?

7
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:23,961
And Princess Shuna, you also look wonderful.

8
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:27,727
Thank you.

9
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:31,234
Well then, I'll also be going.

10
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,328
Princess Shuna!

11
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:37,571
Go and beat down Clayman's underling for us!

12
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:38,938
For our sake!

13
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:40,523
Yes!

14
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,328
Be careful, okay?

15
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,125
Yes, and you too, Great Rimuru.

16
00:00:57,313 --> 00:01:01,586
It's almost time for the meeting, but they sure lack any tension.

17
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:05,289
Say, there are ten Demon Lords, right?

18
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:10,145
Milim, Ramiris, Leon, Carrion, Frey, Clayman...

19
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,274
Who's the other four?

20
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,520
I have no interest in little gnats.

21
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:20,939
But I fought a female vampire demon lord around 2,000 years ago.

22
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,465
A female demon lord?

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,965
Not exactly the type who know how to have fun.

24
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:27,933
She got furious when I burn down her capital.

25
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,338
Anyone would be angry with that.

26
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,468
But I do feel bad about it now, a little.

27
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,326
Just a little?

28
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:39,123
If I remember correctly...

29
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:41,093
Lu... Lurus?

30
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:43,223
Or was it Milus?

31
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:47,403
I didn't use my full strength, but she was strong enough to serve as my playmate,

32
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,138
so you better be careful.

33
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:53,280
Though that country is now ruled by Roy Valentine as its new demon lord

34
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,263
since around 1,500 years ago.

35
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:57,117
So it's another guy now?

36
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:58,705
-Aaaah! -What is it?!

37
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,500
A new enemy right at this moment?!

38
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:03,497
What a well done cliffhanger!

39
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,292
Think seriously or I will spoil you!

40
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:08,270
Don't be like that.

41
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:11,449
There's also a giant-race demon lord, Daggrull.

42
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,714
We fought a number of times, but we never had a clear winner.

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,687
If you remember his name, then he must've been really strong.

44
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,359
Not really. If we fight now, I'll win.

45
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,227
And I never fought this guy before,

46
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:28,314
but I remember that demon, Guy Crimson.

47
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:30,164
You never fought him?

48
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,508
He lives in the far north, after all.

49
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,447
For someone as important as me,

50
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,950
there exists no reason to go to an empty place like that.

51
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,656
Well yeah, Guy is strong, after all.

52
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,588
Guy, me, and Milim are what's known as the most ancient demon lords!

53
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:49,652
I see.

54
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,310
So who's the last one?

55
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,034
I don't know.

56
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,475
Must be Dino.

57
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,207
He sleeps all day and slacks off a lot, even more than me!

58
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:02,421
So you two were two peas in a pod, then.

59
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:04,404
We're not!

60
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:06,948
And that makes it ten.

61
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,793
It's finally the time.

62
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,210
There's our guide.

63
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,492
Who designed this door?

64
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,185
Talk about grandiose.

65
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:27,720
I have come to guide you, Lady Ramiris.

66
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,586
This maid...

67
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:31,678
She shares the same kind of pressure as Diablo.

68
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,132
A demon, and a high rank one at that.

69
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,140
Long time no see, Misery!

70
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:39,057
How's your partner, Rein?

71
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:41,471
She's doing well, thank you for your concern.

72
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,501
And the person over there is Rimuru, correct?

73
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,311
My master, Great Guy has commanded me to bring you.

74
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,273
So she's one of the ancient demon lord Guy's subordinate?

75
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,066
Please proceed through.

76
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,897
Let's go! Beretta, Treyni!

77
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,825
Yes, Lady Ramiris.

78
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,133
On your side.

79
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,644
Take care, Lady Ramiris.

80
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:07,668
Beyond that door, the ruler of this world are waiting.

81
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,364
But I've already decided to become a Demon Lord.

82
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,364
I can't let myself be taken aback now.

83
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,126
Let's go.

84
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,619
Yes!

85
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:23,658
Lord Rimuru.

86
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,401
Everyone, please take care as well.

87
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,691
Call me as soon as something happens, okay!

88
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:02,376
Fate repeats all over again

89
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:04,751
The voices of my heart say

90
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,914
Time is not enough, it's over

91
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:13,337
Belief that makes me who I am

92
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,696
Light doesn't fade away

93
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:18,540
Made my mind up now, it's better

94
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:24,025
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

95
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,948
Lured by your hands

96
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:29,532
Even if it rains don't be swayed

97
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:31,579
Being same as always

98
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:34,267
Want to feel my destiny

99
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,892
Open my eyes to be braver

100
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:40,094
Get up now Get up now stronger

101
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,394
I believe in myself

102
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,620
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

103
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:48,361
I'll never run away

104
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:53,025
I might lose control

105
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:59,204
It's a perfect world

106
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,727
Destroy all of it, in the end it's for our good

107
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:07,907
Let me shout like flames

108
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:13,063
(Episode 45: Adalmann, the Index Finger) Where's Clayman's castle?

109
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:17,169
This mist is blocking our Magic Sense.

110
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:21,306
Seems like the enemy is gathering information through this mist.

111
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:34,102
It looks like we've fallen into a trap.

112
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,562
A trap?

113
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,360
But I didn't sense enemy's presence--

114
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:38,751
What?

115
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,572
How come?

116
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:49,204
Where were so many of these enemies hiding, such that we couldn't notice them?

117
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,717
They weren't hiding.

118
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:54,047
We were lured.

119
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,454
Into the center of their siege.

120
00:06:56,821 --> 00:07:00,258
Without our Magic Sense, assessing enemy's force is difficult.

121
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,124
However, if number is all they got...

122
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:08,053
Princess Shuna, I will open up a path. Use that chance and go with Hakuro--

123
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,537
No, Soei.

124
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,696
Seems like it won't be that easy.

125
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:20,190
Such a massive magical force...

126
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,243
I see, then he must be...

127
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,891
One of Clayman's Five Finger.

128
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,649
Adalmann, the Index Finger.

129
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,235
Indeed.

130
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,180
I am Adalmann.

131
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:33,579
The wight king who rules over countless undead.

132
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:39,555
I've been ordered by the great demon lord Clayman to protect this land.

133
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,003
Lowly intruders.

134
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,312
I would advise you to submit your lives here and now.

135
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:47,844
We're completely surrounded.

136
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,062
Escaping with Spatial Transportation is also not an option.

137
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,023
To only way to get out of this is to defeat Adalmann.

138
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:57,641
Then we shall strike now.

139
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,711
No objection.

140
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:01,352
My attack can kill even the dead.

141
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,815
Impudent fools!

142
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,361
You've made a grave mistake!

143
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:12,843
To be capable to read my movement.

144
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:17,172
Are you still a swordsman at heart, even as the rest of your body decays?

145
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,383
A dragon zombie?

146
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,571
It's not a mere dragon zombie.

147
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,844
The pinnacle of the undead.

148
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:31,532
It's a Death Dragon!

149
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:34,875
A dead monster.

150
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:35,986
Then die!

151
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,110
Mystic Thread Strike!

152
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,407
The end.

153
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,118
I see.

154
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:59,563
So it has resistance against death.

155
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,849
Then let me destroy not only your body, but soul and all!

156
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:05,896
Soei, calm down.

157
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:08,399
You should be able to notice if you're calm.

158
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,094
Looks like that dragon's soul is within Adalmann.

159
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:19,461
Don't worry about me and just focus on keeping hold of that dragon.

160
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:21,641
I will defeat Adalmann.

161
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,274
That's too dangerous.

162
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:24,829
No, Soei.

163
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:26,740
Listen.

164
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:28,506
I'm angry.

165
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,571
That's right.

166
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:36,516
Ever since we left the Ogre village and meet Great Rimuru...

167
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:40,743
Princess Shuna is no longer a weak princess in need of constant protection.

168
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:42,562
Understood.

169
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,227
Best of luck, Princess Shuna.

170
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,852
You too.

171
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,360
That dragon's all yours.

172
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:58,704
The otherworlder's actions.

173
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,227
Falmuth Kingdom's invasion.

174
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:03,696
And Clayman who was behind it all.

175
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:07,125
I did not come here to sightsee.

176
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:11,569
Oh? And what do you intend to do, little girl?

177
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,039
What can do possibly accomplish without your bodyguard?

178
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:17,797
Needless worry.

179
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,834
Alignment Field!

180
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:35,187
Now we won't have any distraction.

181
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,220
If I defeat you,

182
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:42,268
that will destroy the defense system that relies on you as its core, right?

183
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,407
Hmm, impressive.

184
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:47,290
And you've seen through my secret, as well.

185
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:49,531
What is your name, little girl?

186
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:51,540
My name is Shuna.

187
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:54,180
Shuna... Miss Shuna.

188
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,438
Then let's battle, shall we?

189
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:01,369
If you can defeat me, I will obey your command.

190
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,305
Well, what a polite request.

191
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:08,844
However, all we seek is demon lord Clayman's fall.

192
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:13,415
If you stay out of our way, I'll allow you to reside on this land.

193
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,469
And I'm sure you're well aware that I could not do so.

194
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,016
I see.

195
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,641
I imagined you might be capable of overcoming the ties that bind you.

196
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,782
But perhaps I've overestimated you.

197
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:30,336
If I could, I would've done so eons ago.

198
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:33,274
You sure make it all sound so easy.

199
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:34,938
Then as planned.

200
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:37,790
I shall defeat you.

201
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,622
Try to resist me with everything you've got!

202
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,962
Melt all and wear it away, Acid Shell!

203
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,311
Flame Ball!

204
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,679
Then how about this?

205
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:03,160
Malicious dead, accept this sacrifice!

206
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,308
Curse Bind!

207
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,506
Holy Bell!

208
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,779
Impossible! A divine miracle?!

209
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:23,446
How? How could a monster be able to use holy magic?!

210
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,078
Do you find it strange?

211
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,652
Then you must be lacking in imagination.

212
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:31,834
As long as they believe in the power of miracles,

213
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,129
anyone could wield Holy magic with their belief.

214
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,316
What... did you say?!

215
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:42,373
Ever since I was betrayed by the supreme leaders of Luminism,

216
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:45,409
I lost my faith in the god Luminus.

217
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:47,806
With how I am now,

218
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:51,293
I thought I would never be able to wield holy magic again...

219
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:54,597
But is she saying I was wrong?

220
00:12:55,293 --> 00:13:00,050
Why? Why did you think I used to be a master of holy magic?

221
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:02,081
Your outfit.

222
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:06,787
Only high-level bishops and above are permitted to war that white vestment.

223
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:10,613
However, despite being worthy of such fine robes...

224
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:14,234
You're a weak man who whines, unable to conquer lowly bind such as this.

225
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:19,340
You wore that robe simply out of blind attachment towards holy magic.

226
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,763
My caution over you seems to be all for naught.

227
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,105
I've let you spout far too much nonsense!

228
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,113
Here I give my prayer to the One.

229
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:33,808
For I seek the power of the holy spirits.

230
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:39,062
Listen to my wish!

231
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:43,058
She's right. I simply lacked the resolve.

232
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:47,050
Having my beloved friends turn into undead,

233
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,662
I told myself I couldn't die and leave them behind.

234
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,999
I was weak!

235
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,577
If I truly believe in miracle and wish for it...

236
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:56,482
I have no resentment for this girl Shuna.

237
00:13:56,515 --> 00:14:01,142
Far from that, I even owe her great dept for opening my eyes.

238
00:14:01,418 --> 00:14:04,927
However, because of the man who binds me here,

239
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:08,827
Demon Lord Kazaream and his curse, I'm unable to kill myself!

240
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:11,017
I apologize, Miss Shuna.

241
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,936
I will need to take you down with me!

242
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:17,391
Exhaust everything! Disintegration!

243
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:19,183
I was waiting for that.

244
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,019
Overdrive!

245
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:31,441
Wh-What?!

246
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:34,332
She overwrote my magic?!

247
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,152
Impressive.

248
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,269
As a reward, let me release you from that power.

249
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,464
Wonderfully done, Princess Shuna.

250
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,777
It's over now.

251
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:20,925
I must say, that death knight was far more capable than I had estimated.

252
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,464
You saved me life there, Princess Shuna.

253
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,027
No, you were a great help to me.

254
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,636
You too, Soei.

255
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:31,656
You did well buying me so much time facing that death dragon.

256
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:35,419
It shames me that I could not defeat it.

257
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:42,558
It seems like I've let my anger drive me a little too reckless.

258
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,191
Indeed.

259
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:48,597
Our newfound strength might've made us grow a tad bit conceit.

260
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:51,064
Just like what Great Rimuru worried about,

261
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,558
there is no telling what may happen in battle.

262
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,691
I should've gathered more intelligence.

263
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,949
Well then.

264
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,293
Let's seize Clayman's castle as planned.

265
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,759
Please wait.

266
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:11,221
You're still alive?!

267
00:16:11,246 --> 00:16:12,869
Did you need me to finish you off?

268
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,356
Hakuro, wait.

269
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:17,800
It looks like he no longer has the will to fight.

270
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:19,519
Lady Shuna.

271
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,199
Lady?

272
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,820
Thanks to your magic,

273
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,782
all of us have been released from the bound that tied us here!

274
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,320
Perhaps it is fate that kept us alive without being cleansed.

275
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:37,164
I have a request that I hope you will let me propose!

276
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,582
What is it?

277
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,667
I was hoping to meet the figure

278
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,753
that you have devoted your faith to, Lady Shuna.

279
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:48,257
Ever since I lost my faith, I also lost the power I had in my prime.

280
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,511
My faith in my god Luminus is dead.

281
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:55,074
Which is why I would like to find myself a new god to worship.

282
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,934
Well, rather than a god...

283
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,121
We do have great respect for Great Rimuru,

284
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,020
but we don't worship him.

285
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,027
Oooh! So his name is Great Rimuru!

286
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:10,574
Truly a wonderful name, one fully worthy of describing our new god!

287
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:15,253
We may merely a group of weak, fragile undead,

288
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:18,480
but I believe we may be able to offer you some assistance.

289
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:22,988
Would it be possible for you to arrange us a meeting with this Great Rimuru?

290
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:34,917
Well, it should be all right.

291
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:39,144
He might give up once he sees Great Rimuru in flesh.

292
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:41,144
Very well.

293
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:43,761
Thank you very much!

294
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:45,527
But before that.

295
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:49,543
We have something we must do.

296
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:52,480
Understood.

297
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:54,902
Then let me show you the way.

298
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:57,433
Please follow after me.

299
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:01,621
Please, this way.

300
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:13,230
Over here.

301
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,589
Not good.

302
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:29,027
That guy's a bad news.

303
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,861
He's clearly on a whole another level.

304
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:35,240
He must be one of the ancient demon lord, Guy Crimson.

305
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,441
That size...

306
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:49,418
And enormous magicule energy...

307
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:52,433
He must be the giant-race demon lord, Daggrull.

308
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:04,988
That tooth...

309
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:06,771
Is he a vampire?

310
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,988
Then is he the demon lord Valentin?

311
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:14,128
Wait a second.

312
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,698
His attendant...

313
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,690
Answer.

314
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:19,587
Analyze and Assess indicates that the target

315
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:23,487
likely bears more magicules than the demon lord Valentin.

316
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:25,269
I knew it.

317
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:28,183
Then that maid might be the real demon lord.

318
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:30,847
Lurus or Milus or something.

319
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,732
Let's hope she didn't find out my relationship with Veldora.

320
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:38,103
If she did, I hope I wouldn't have to take care of the mess.

321
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:45,649
Heyo! Still tiny as always, aren't you?

322
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,978
Picking a fight now?

323
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,356
You really should keep your cheeky attidute in check, Dino!

324
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,868
Why would I need to, dumbass? It's obvious I will win.

325
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:56,878
Eager to die, aren't you?

326
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:59,196
Just so you know, I'm in perfect condition today!

327
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,954
You sure you didn't shrunk since the last time we meet?

328
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:06,721
It can't be helped okay! I only just got reborn recently!

329
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:09,709
Wha?! Why a loner like you got attendants here?!

330
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,863
You make me look like a dweeb for showing up alone!

331
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:18,158
Yeah! Now I can get back at everyone for calling me a little shrimp and a loner!

332
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,751
Especially you!

333
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:23,462
-You're no match against them! -These two are really strong, aren't they?

334
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,165
Like, for real, these two are no joke!

335
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:27,361
Right? See! See!

336
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:30,731
Now I've got the muscle to back up my words!

337
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:33,196
Okay, I think I get their relationship now.

338
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:34,900
Hmm, fine by me.

339
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,728
What's up with that? We're not done talking yet!

340
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:53,878
She must be the harpy demon lord Frey that The Three Beastketeers talked about.

341
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,337
Oh dear.

342
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,089
Erotic! In every sence of the word!

343
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,510
Why don't we just make her the number one?

344
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,512
Great Rimuru.

345
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,676
Wh-What is it, Shion?

346
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:06,395
Crap! She'll yell at me!

347
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:07,976
The man behind her.

348
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,103
Don't he look suspicious to you?

349
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,529
She's right.

350
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:17,855
He sure has quite a high magicule energy, even compared to those in this meeting.

351
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,895
Could he be...

352
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,802
Report.

353
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,517
According to my analysis and assessment--

354
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,928
Nah, even if he's Carrion in hiding,

355
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:28,508
but there's no way he would be here with such an obvious disguise, so no.

356
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,081
Raphael, what did--

357
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,363
So you're Rimuru?

358
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,213
Yes, I am.

359
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,590
I see.

360
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,509
So you're Leon?

361
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,238
Did you need something?

362
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,231
No.

363
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:51,293
Your look brought back some memories, that's all.

364
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,020
Leon.

365
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,772
Shizu is dead.

366
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,273
I know.

367
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,737
Of course she would be.

368
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:03,235
After all, she continued to reject Ifrit and refused to become a majin.

369
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:06,848
It's not like she asked me.

370
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:08,824
But let me punch you.

371
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,027
I refuse.

372
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:14,339
I gave Shizu the chance to decide how she will live her life.

373
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,777
And she decided to live her life as a human.

374
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:20,714
I even gave her Ifrit as a farewell gift,

375
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,918
I see no reason why I deserve a beating for it.

376
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,428
But I do have an interest in you.

377
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,433
If you have an issue with me, I'll invite you to my castle.

378
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:34,145
If you think it's a trap, you can simply turn down the offer.

379
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,731
All right.

380
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,609
I'll come to visit, so give me the invitation.

381
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,160
I will.

382
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,894
Assuming you can get out of this meeting alive, that is.

383
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,879
Milim!

384
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:56,668
Thank goodness, at least she looks all right.

385
00:22:57,145 --> 00:23:00,087
With Carrion missing, that makes eight.

386
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,527
Which means the guy with that annoying face is...

387
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:05,254
Walk faster, you slowpoke!

388
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:14,621
Well everyone, sorry to keep you waiting.

389
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,529
Clayman...

390
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:29,595
I will make you pay for punching my friend like that.

391
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:32,457
Don't expect your death to be an easy one!

392
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:38,835
Next time, "Walpurgis."
