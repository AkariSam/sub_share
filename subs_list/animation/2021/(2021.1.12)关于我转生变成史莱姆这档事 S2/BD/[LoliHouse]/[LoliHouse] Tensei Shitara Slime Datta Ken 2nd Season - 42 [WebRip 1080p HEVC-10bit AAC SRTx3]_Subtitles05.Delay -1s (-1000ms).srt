1
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,914
Wonderfully done, Great Rimuru.

2
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,414
It was one truly magnificent spell.

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,977
Yes! It was great!

4
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,529
Fascinating!

5
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,921
Rimuru! How about I go there
and beat the enemy instead?

6
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:27,319
Just hold it.

7
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:31,805
We want to keep you a secret until
Walpurgis begins, remember?

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,833
If you go there, people will know
it's you right off the bat.

9
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:40,497
That's right! It just slipped off my head!

10
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,390
Don't forget it like that!

11
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:45,379
Anyway, don't do anything
unnecessarily, you hear me?

12
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:52,046
Benimaru and others headed to
the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania

13
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:54,281
to fight Clayman's army.

14
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:58,499
At the same time, Gazel returns to Dwargon.

15
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:02,053
And Erald returns to Thalion.

16
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:06,839
Meanwhile, Youm and his friends
head to take over Falmuth.

17
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,543
I shall return immediately,
so rest assured.

18
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:12,763
You can take your time.

19
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,790
I shall return immediately,
so rest assured.

20
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:19,299
We're talking about taking over
a nation here, it won't be that easy.

21
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,952
All right!

22
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,556
We should prepare now!

23
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,919
For Walpurgis!

24
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,277
(Fate repeats all over again)

25
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:51,346
Fate repeats all over again

26
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,696
(The voices of my heart say)

27
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:53,721
The voices of my heart say

28
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,450
(依然還是不夠啊 itʼs over)

29
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,884
Time is not enough, it's over

30
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:02,307
Belief that makes me who I am

31
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,247
(Belief that makes me who I am)

32
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,666
(Light doesnʼt fade away)

33
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,666
Light doesn't fade away

34
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,461
(我已經下定決心 itʼs better)

35
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:07,510
Made my mind up now, it's better

36
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:12,995
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

37
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,841
(Yeah I know itʼs not an easy road)

38
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,884
(朝呼喚的方向前進)

39
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,918
Lured by your hands

40
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,555
(Even if it rains donʼt be swayed)

41
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:18,502
Even if it rains don't be swayed

42
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,549
Being same as always

43
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,598
(順從內心自我)

44
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,237
Want to feel my destiny

45
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,226
(渴望感受命運)

46
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,937
(就在此刻覺醒吧勇者)

47
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:25,862
Open my eyes to be braver

48
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:29,064
Get up now Get up now stronger

49
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:29,023
(Get up now Get up now stronger)

50
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,401
(I believe in myself)

51
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,364
I believe in myself

52
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,590
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

53
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:34,696
(Stand up now Stand up now shouting)

54
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:37,323
(Iʼll never run away)

55
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:37,321
I'll never run away

56
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,871
(I might lose control…)

57
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:41,995
I might lose control

58
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:48,174
It's a perfect world

59
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:53,673
(請為了我們 照亮這個世界吧)

60
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,697
Destroy all of it,
in the end it's for our good

61
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,635
(Let me shout like flames)

62
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:56,877
Let me shout like flames

63
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,890
There's no one there?

Yes, the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania

00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,408
How come?

70
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:11,978
Oh well.

71
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:14,178
Search the whole area thoroughly.

72
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:15,671
Smoke them out.

73
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:16,838
Yes, sir.

74
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:19,523
And one more thing.

75
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:25,988
One of our men heard an interesting
story from a passing merchant.

76
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,902
Interesting story?

77
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:28,801
Yes.

78
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:31,886
He said the Storm Dragon
Veldora has been revived.

79
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,593
Veldora...

80
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:43,015
According to him, the Falmuth army
fell victim to Veldora's rampage.

81
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,351
So it's the Storm Dragon's fault?

82
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,279
Yes.

83
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,033
And apparently, the Storm Dragon had
lost most of his energy upon his revival.

84
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:54,084
I see.

85
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:59,272
So that's why I lost contact with
Pirone and my Marionettes in Falmuth.

86
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:02,194
It was all because of Veldora's revival.

87
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,457
There was no way a mere slime
could destroy Falmuth's army.

88
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:12,211
And it should be easy for me to kill
the Evil Dragon at his current state.

89
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,590
Not only that, I may even be able
to add him to my cache of pawns...

90
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,544
Yamza, good job on the report.

91
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:20,194
Continue on with your job.

92
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,258
Yes, sir!

93
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:26,967
To think I was so close
to fall into his bluff.

94
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:30,780
Still, truth is not something that
one can hide so easily.

95
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,233
You mere slime who swaggers
about under the Evil Dragon.

96
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,007
Consider this an honor.

97
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:39,795
I shall crush you
with my very own hands.

98
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:44,327
Don't be overconfident in your control
over Demon Lord Milim.

99
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:46,756
Whatever you do,
don't let your guard down.

100
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,085
Don't worry, Laplace.

101
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,131
I will win.

102
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:22,903
Hey, Frey! What a good weather
we're having today!

103
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,518
Or maybe it's a little hot?

104
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,590
Aaah! It's so hot today!

105
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:28,887
Milim...

106
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,749
You seem to be in a great mood.

107
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,911
Did something nice happen to you?

108
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,207
You could tell?! Well, you see...

109
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:38,739
Take a look at these!

110
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:46,754
Oh my, it looks great on you.
Where'd you get those?

111
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,450
You wanna know?!

112
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,231
What should I do?

113
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,668
Well, I won't mind telling you.

114
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,926
But what should I do?

115
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,004
Troublesome girl as always.

116
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,512
We're friends, aren't we?

117
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:02,238
It should be okay for you to tell me.

118
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:05,157
Really? Oh Frey, we sure are friends!

119
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,715
All right! I will tell you! You see--

120
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:13,019
And like that, my besties Rimuru
gave me these as a present.

121
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:16,629
Ah, besties means best friends
among best friends!

122
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:18,754
I see, I'm happy for you.

123
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:22,020
Ah, that's right. Milim.

124
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,261
As your friend, I also have a present for you.

125
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,879
Would you take it?

126
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:32,332
Ooh, a pendant? I can have it?

127
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:33,926
But...

128
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:36,152
I won't give you these knuckles!

129
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:39,025
It's okay, Milim.

130
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,340
Consider it a symbol of our friendship.

131
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:43,541
I want to have my gratitude,

132
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:46,240
so I would love it if you could
wear it every once in a while.

133
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,827
If that's the case, then leave it to me.

134
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,247
Let me put this on for you.

135
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:01,122
It tickles!

136
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:02,437
Don't move, okay?

137
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,930
Would that be all, Clayman?

138
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,531
Good work.

139
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,766
The forbidden spell, Demon Marionette
has been activated with no problem.

140
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:32,445
Now I finally obtained
the ultimate puppet!

141
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,132
This is what you get for picking on me
and calling me a young upstart!

142
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,422
Pathetic, isn't it, Milim?

143
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,898
I advice you to stop that.

144
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:59,730
This isn't the sort of weak curse that'll
undo itself after a punch or two.

145
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,672
Don't you resent her as well for
being so bossy around us?

146
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:06,455
Isn't that why
you joined me on my plan?

147
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:08,141
Or is it not?

148
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,343
It's not.

149
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:12,493
I'm just fulfilling my promise to you.

150
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,703
Cut it with that innocent act.

151
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,070
This thing is now nothing
more than a mere puppet.

152
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,406
There is no need to hold back!

153
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:26,465
So that's your true nature.

154
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,008
What a pathetic man.

155
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:31,595
So Clayman, it seems like
you don't know about this.

156
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,125
But Milim has a self-defense mechanism.

157
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,445
Huh?

158
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:37,242
Self-defense mechanism?

159
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,270
It's called Stampede.

160
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,656
I heard it will put her in
an uncontrollable state.

161
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,316
I don't mind you die on your own,

162
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,444
but I don't want to
be caught in the mess.

163
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,407
What an annoying
Demon Lord to the core.

164
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,977
Very well.

165
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:56,328
I can still use her to strengthen
my clout in our rank.

166
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,039
And you're my accomplice.

167
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,227
I'll expect you work for me.

168
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:04,757
Oh my, aren't we supposed
to be equal on this matter?

169
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:05,782
Fool!

170
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:08,299
I'm the one who came out with this plan!

171
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,010
You're already one of my pawns.

172
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,437
Or what?

173
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:16,781
You want to fight Milim?

174
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,894
Is that supposed to be a threat?

175
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:24,065
You can take it any way you like.

176
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,735
If you don't want to die,
you better not anger me.

177
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,289
All right.

178
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:35,993
Good. Just don't think about doing
anything to betray me, okay?

179
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,383
As long as you listen to my requests,

180
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:41,999
I'll guarantee your position
as the ruler of the sky.

181
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,127
Miss Frey, the Sky Queen.

182
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:57,758
That man could not see
the true essence of things.

183
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,269
On the day of the new moon,
the night of Walpurgis.

184
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:07,977
Clayman, it seems like you
won't be alive for much longer.

185
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,834
Lord of Darkness.

186
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,641
To Demon Lord Guy Crimson.

187
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:33,461
Demon Lord Leon Cromwell has arrived.

188
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,303
Long time no see.

189
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,264
My friend, the Platinum Devil.

190
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:21,173
Demon Lord Cromwell.

191
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,810
Or do you prefer me to call
you Platinum Saber instead?

192
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,309
Call me whatever.

193
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,480
Have you been well?

194
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,275
I'm glad you responded to my call.

195
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,661
Let me thank you.

196
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:43,934
Stop it! I told you
I don't swing that way!

197
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:47,708
You're as cold as usual!

198
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:52,098
If you wish, I can become a girl
and let you sleep with me.

199
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,747
Silence.

200
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,200
Oh well, let's move somewhere else.

201
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,825
So, what did you call me here for?

202
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,754
As you know, the banquet of Demon Lords,
Walpurgis will be held soon.

203
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:13,192
I was thinking to implore
you to attend this time.

204
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,736
It sure is rare for you to force
anything upon me like that.

205
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,137
I will have you come even if
I have to owe you a favor.

206
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:25,728
The reason being?

207
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,124
Cautious as usual, aren't you?

208
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,442
Fine, I will explain.

209
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,632
The proponent this time is Clayman.

210
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,707
The little one.

211
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:42,471
But oddly enough, Milim's name
was on the list of endorsers.

212
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:46,976
Milim is one of the oldest and strongest
Demon Lords, up there with me.

213
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,856
She wouldn't lift a finger
for the likes of Clayman.

214
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,897
Which means...

215
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,884
The report of Carrion's death
might not be entirely true?

216
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,861
Oh, you know, don't you?

217
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,863
Clayman overstepped his boundaries.

218
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,951
He tried to harass me without leaving
any evidence behind.

219
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,703
I won't let him pass this time.

220
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:09,942
Setting Carrion's case aside, if Milim
is taking action then it's a bad news.

221
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,798
This might be just
another game for Milim,

222
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,978
but I don't want anyone tipping
the balance of power among the Demon Lords.

223
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:19,082
It'll just give me more work.

224
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,262
Do you think Milim is being
controlled by Clayman?

225
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,887
Thinking about Milim will get you nowhere.

226
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:29,488
A genius like me can't read
the behavior of a moron.

227
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:32,604
You can consider it one of few
weaknesses that I have.

228
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,108
Since you seem to be
interested in the matter,

229
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:40,154
does that mean you will
participate this time, Leon?

230
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,442
Yes, I intend to.

231
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm not interested in a friendly meeting,
but it seems like I have no choice.

232
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,106
Oh, then I'm glad.

233
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:54,627
And here I was thinking of letting you
sleep with me for a night if you refuse--

234
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:55,603
I refuse.

235
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,539
So cold.

236
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,817
You're just so cold.

237
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:06,096
Do you know anything about
this Rimuru guy?

238
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:09,725
The way Clayman puts it,
he's just a self-styled Demon Lord.

239
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:15,230
But if he has the strength to back it up,
I have no problem with it.

240
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,358
So you're saying he's qualified
to be a Demon Lord?

241
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,195
Since Ramiris has taken a liking in him,

242
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,655
I figured he might be
quite an interesting guy.

243
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,075
Ramiris?

244
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,001
I can't stand that spirit.

245
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:28,665
She makes fun of me
every time we meet.

246
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:31,288
I've thought about strangling
her to death countless times.

247
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:34,625
You better not.

248
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,920
If you kill Ramiris,
I will be your enemy.

249
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,213
Figured.

250
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,672
I wasn't serious.

251
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,342
It's not like I can win against
you in a fight, anyway.

252
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,511
Nnn? I wouldn't be so sure.

253
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,098
I say you'd kill me in
one in a million tries.

254
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,599
Don't be ridiculous.

255
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,936
I'm not interested in a fight
I'm not guaranteed to win.

256
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,043
Don't be so modest.

257
00:14:56,068 --> 00:15:00,848
You're strong enough for even having
the possibility of killing me, Leon.

258
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,957
Hmph, that goes without saying.

259
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:05,781
You and Milim are simply
on a different level from us.

260
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,493
And speaking of that.

261
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,496
I heard the Storm Dragon Veldora
has awoken recently.

262
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,403
Oh my?

263
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,957
I am very interested in
the topic you're having there.

264
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,067
Almost forgot you're also here.

265
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,593
One of the four remaining dragons.

266
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,501
The White Ice Dragon, Velzard.

267
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:30,033
The Ice Empress.

268
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:35,020
Oh my, forgetting me already?
Cold as always, aren't you?

269
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:38,522
But I'm glad to see your face here.

270
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:43,293
Is it so? Then it is also a pleasure
to my eye to see your face.

271
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,281
You two never did get
along with each other.

272
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,489
Leon, are you feeling jealous
towards my partner?

273
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,965
Nonsense.

274
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,872
So, Sir Leon.

275
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,500
You're saying my younger brother
Veldora has awoken?

276
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,961
I stopped sensing his presence
around two years ago,

277
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,213
so I assumed he had met his end.

278
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,631
Are you certain?

279
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,550
No mistake.

280
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,928
If so, then why that Evil Dragon
hasn't done anything?

281
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:13,515
Has he weakened to the point
he couldn't replenish energy on his own?

282
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,393
Then who would've undone his seal?

283
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:20,898
As the spy reports it,
Clayman's scheme was the cause.

284
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,691
Clayman, huh...

285
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,901
Seems like he manipulated
Falmuth from the shadow

286
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:28,697
in an attempt to destroy
the nation Rimuru had built.

287
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,324
You sure know much, Leon.

288
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,533
Of course I do.

289
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,995
I'm a former human, unlike you.

290
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:39,041
And apparently, Veldora was sleeping
right around the battlefield.

291
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,126
Just before he disappeared for good,

292
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,620
he was exposed to vast amounts
of blood and thus awakened.

293
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:50,652
The Falmuth's troops were subsequently
massacred by his rage,

294
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,888
and Rimuru survived
through the ordeal.

295
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,473
Or so I heard.

296
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,332
So that's what happened, huh?

297
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,728
Then did his seal get undone by accident?

298
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,397
Who knows, I can't tell you that much.

299
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,543
I see.

300
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,119
Then there is a chance that
the hero's seal was incomplete.

301
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:11,981
That might be the case, but
I also came up with a hypothesis.

302
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,536
Hypothesis?

303
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,954
It's weird that his presence
just disappeared out of nowhere.

304
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,623
But what if someone transported him

305
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,543
alongside the seal into a
subspace of their making?

306
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,332
Interesting!

307
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:27,172
Then someone must've undone
the seal for him!

308
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:32,678
That means that someone would
have a power equal to us!

309
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,674
It's still just a possibility.

310
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:39,192
And Leon, you're thinking that person
might be Rimuru, aren't you?

311
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,020
Precisely.

312
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,938
I see.

313
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:46,067
Then we really need to
ascertain this person.

314
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:49,653
Clayman's scheme and
Milim's suspicious action.

315
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,512
How Rimuru turned into a Demon Lord.

316
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,098
Veldora's revival.

317
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,481
If all of these are connected...

318
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:03,364
Then we must be up for a spectacle
in Walpurgis this time.

319
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:07,528
If so, then why is Veldora
acting so obedient?

320
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:14,536
He seems to have weakened.

321
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,307
His presence is so weak now,
it's nothing like what he was before.

322
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,561
But it is strange that
he didn't go into more rampage.

323
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,286
Running amok was like
the only source of joy for him.

324
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:29,700
Anyhow, I don't care about that.

325
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,801
If you two want to get Veldora on
your side, then do as you pleased.

326
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,491
You're leaving already?

327
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,465
Yeah. That's all you need from me, right?

328
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,856
Just hold on, there's no need to rush.

329
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:47,961
Have you made any progress in
your true goal; targeted summoning?

330
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,088
Not quite yet.

331
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,996
There were hindrance.

332
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,550
Hindrance?

333
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,554
One guy had apparently saved the lives
of some kids who were close to their death.

334
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,306
Before I could take them in.

335
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,766
Oh?

336
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:05,812
Seems like that guy got angry about nations
summoning children from the otherworld.

337
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:09,981
He may start applying pressure
to each of the nations.

338
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,736
So that's the end of that experiment.

339
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,782
Then why don't you just
get rid of that hindrance?

340
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,598
It should be easy for you.

341
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:23,676
That hindrance is the exact Rimuru
we were just discussing.

342
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:25,801
What did you say?!

343
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:27,598
Is that really just a coincidence?

344
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,503
Interesting, don't you think?

345
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,316
That's why I also want
to see him in person.

346
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:37,094
I see, now I'm more interested than ever.

347
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:41,114
Milim might be thinking the same
thing as me right now.

348
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,768
She's a moron, but she's also
quite sharp in some places.

349
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,353
Perhaps.

350
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,272
Well, tonight's Walpurgis could
be a rather raucous occasion.

351
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,832
No doubt about it.

352
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,504
By the way, who is this collaborator
of yours providing your information?

353
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,867
He seems to be a human from the Empire,
I don't know much about him.

354
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,412
He call himself a merchant.

355
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,330
Can you trust him?

356
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,623
Trust?

357
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,270
Why should I?

358
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,502
I'm just making use of him.

359
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,672
If you're fine with that,
then I don't have anything to say.

360
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,424
But don't let your guard down.

361
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:18,457
I'm not letting you die on your own.

362
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,139
You're worried about me?

363
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,207
How rare.

364
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,933
Rest assured, Guy.

365
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,561
I have no intention of dying
before I accomplish my goal.

366
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,354
That's reassuring.

367
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,776
Is that goal of yours
really that important?

368
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,109
Yeah.

369
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:41,145
It is something that I would
prioritize over anything in this world.

370
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,497
I see, that makes me jealous.

371
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,786
Don't feed me with that lie.

372
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,903
But I'll accept your warning.

373
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,168
See you in Walpurgis.

374
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:53,637
See ya.

375
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,926
What an impatient guy.

376
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,004
But that's just like him.

377
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:06,848
But it's pretty uncharacteristic
of him to be so rash like that.

378
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,060
Should I investigate for him?

379
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,551
Stop it.

380
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,442
Meddling with Leon's affair
will just offend him.

381
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,236
I don't want my friend to hate me.

382
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:22,157
We can just help him
when he asks for it.

383
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,309
Understood.

384
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,411
Looks like this Walpurgis
will be a fun one.

385
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,606
Do you want to come, too?

386
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,418
Let's see...

387
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,876
No, I don't think I will.

388
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,086
Perhaps if my brother were there,
but otherwise,

389
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,048
I have no interest in the Demon Lords.

390
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,348
I see.

391
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:41,218
Then keep the lights on for me.

392
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,059
Yes.

393
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,973
Well then, excuse me.

394
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:51,286
Interesting.

395
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:55,036
It has been several hundred years
since I feel so excited.

396
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:59,114
I can feel a big wave of change will come.

397
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:04,356
For Walpurgis!

398
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,950
The more you got hurt

399
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,962
(在過去留下多少傷痕)

400
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,300
(就撒下多少種子吧)

401
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,427
That seed of hope

402
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,989
You plant on both of your hand

403
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,846
(那些雙手灑下的希望之種)

404
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:31,239
Will surely bloom someday

405
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,225
(何時會發芽呢)

406
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:38,358
(不管是永恆或甚麼都無關緊要)

407
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:37,250
Whatever it is,
it doesn't have to last forever

408
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,651
(只要你能微笑)

409
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,802
As long as it makes you smile

410
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:47,450
(我為尋找在剎那間四散的意義)

411
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:47,528
To find the meaning behind
that fleeting moment

412
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:53,456
(決定踏上旅程)

413
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,653
Let's go on a journey

414
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,499
(一同前行吧)

415
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,548
Together

416
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,003
(在那你所留下的黑影上)

417
00:22:55,573 --> 00:23:00,108
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

418
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:04,716
(乘著一瞬之間的塵捲風)

419
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:04,655
Above the shadow you cast

420
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:09,304
(Reincarnate 艷麗綻放的花朵)

421
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,382
Reincarnate

422
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:14,377
The full bloom flower will paint
color on this dreary world

423
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:14,267
(將為這枯燥無趣的世界帶來色彩)

424
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:18,689
(If you were reincarnated)

425
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:18,737
If you were reincarnated

426
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:23,360
(Iʼd be with you wherever you go)

427
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,548
I'd be with you wherever you go

428
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:26,321
(Our souls are connected)

429
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,378
Our souls are connected

430
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:31,994
(Iʼll always by your side)

431
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:32,151
I'll always by your side

432
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:39,294
Next time, "The Starting Signal."
