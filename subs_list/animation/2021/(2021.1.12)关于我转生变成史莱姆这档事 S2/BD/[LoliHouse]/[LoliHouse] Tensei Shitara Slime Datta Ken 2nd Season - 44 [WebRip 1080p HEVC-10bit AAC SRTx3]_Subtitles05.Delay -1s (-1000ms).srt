1
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:23,336
Fate repeats all over again

2
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,711
The voices of my heart say

3
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,874
Time is not enough, it's over

4
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:34,297
Belief that makes me who I am

5
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,656
Light doesn't fade away

6
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,500
Made my mind up now, it's better

7
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:44,985
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,908
Lured by your hands

9
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,492
Even if it rains don't be swayed

10
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,539
Being same as always

11
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:55,227
Want to feel my destiny

12
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:57,852
Open my eyes to be braver

13
00:00:57,877 --> 00:01:01,054
Get up now Get up now stronger

14
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,354
I believe in myself

15
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,580
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

16
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:09,321
I'll never run away

17
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:13,985
I might lose control

18
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:20,164
It's a perfect world

19
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:25,687
Destroy all of it,
in the end it's for our good

20
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,867
Let me shout like flames

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,530
(Episode 44: In the Land of Destiny)

22
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,202
S-Sir Gabiru...

23
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,630
That one is not half bad.

24
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:57,535
I expect no less from
the descendants of dragons.

25
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:03,707
Don't you... ignore me!

26
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,522
It's not like I was ignoring you.

27
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,433
I don't have much opportunity to use
throwing technique against monsters.

28
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,033
So this is rather fun for me.

29
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:27,106
It's been ages since I had a foe
so worthy of that throw!

30
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,471
Dammit!

31
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:32,892
You... you made fun of me so easily!

32
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:36,818
What's wrong, Hermes?
He's pushing you back.

33
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:39,464
Don't talk to me now!

34
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:44,880
Dammit! He's treating me like
a second-class fighter!

35
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:50,046
Who would have thought a man of
your caliber would serve Clayman.

36
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:54,425
I thought Yamza was the best around here.

37
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,595
But seems like my hunch was right.

38
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,264
Yamza?

39
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,933
He is rather capable, I'll admit.

40
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,299
But not enough to serve as my playmate.

41
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:10,900
Spite how I look, I've sparred
with Lady Milim on a regular occasion.

42
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,062
Milim?!

43
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:13,781
Lady Milim, the Demon Lord herself?!

44
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:16,739
So you guys are the Dragon Faithful?!

45
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,866
Yes, that's correct.

46
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,312
No wonder.

47
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:24,372
You guys just seemed so different
from the rest of Clayman's troops.

48
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,920
Oho! That dragonewt
just defeated Hermes!

49
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,089
I knew he could do it!

50
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:35,331
That's our boss!

51
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,343
Sir Gabiru is so cool!

52
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,031
Only natural.

53
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,765
That was quite a performance.

54
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,863
Father Middray! Don't just
laugh there and help me!

55
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:49,897
You lost, fool!

56
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:54,360
And it doesn't seem like that dragonewt
has any intention of killing you.

57
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,702
Just stay there and think about
what you could've done better.

58
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:06,247
That leaves just the three of us, I believe?

59
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:11,878
Your men are wonderful fighters,
given how evenly matched they're with mine.

60
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:17,592
It proves they've honed their bodies
and minds, instead of relying on skills.

61
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:20,636
I suppose I should
appreciate your compliment.

62
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,930
My name is Gabiru.

63
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,552
And you serve Lady Milim?

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,479
I am Middray of the Dragon Faithful.

65
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:30,897
I'm Suphia.

66
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,483
The White Tiger Claw,
Suphia of The Three Beastketeers!

67
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,235
I have no name to say to
servants of Clayman,

68
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,863
but if you're with Lady Milim,
it's another story.

69
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,816
Sir Gabiru and Lady Suphia,
I'll make sure to remember your name.

70
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,204
So what it'll be now?

71
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:49,415
I could take on the both
of you at once, if you like?

72
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,543
But before that, can I ask you something?

73
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,324
Oh, what is it?

74
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:59,425
Well, how could a mere human
like you be so strong?

75
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:04,013
Or perhaps the Dragon Faithful
aren't human, to begin with?

76
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,224
Something seems strange about you.

77
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:12,338
If you're inquiring about our species,
then the answer is simple.

78
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,275
Just like Sir Gabiru over here,
we're dragonewts.

79
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,652
What?!

80
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,403
-Eh?!
-Sir Gabiru...

81
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:23,032
However, instead of evolving
from lizardmen,

82
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:27,411
we're descendent of dragons that
mated with the human race.

83
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,956
But in essence, we're the same.

84
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,958
I see!

85
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,460
Come to think of it, my sister Soka

86
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,838
also changed her
appearance into that of human.

87
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,799
No wonder you're too strong for a human.

88
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,349
That being said,

89
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:45,805
many of us had already lost the
ability to turn back to our original form.

90
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:51,686
Not even my priests are able
to turn into a dragon.

91
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:56,075
There's hardly any difference between
us and regular human beings.

92
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,527
But we still inherit the power.

93
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,821
By worshiping a dragon,

94
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:05,449
we make sure we wouldn't
forget the blood within us.

95
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,577
Any more questions, Lady Suphia?

96
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,744
No.

97
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,638
I only wanted to know

98
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:15,501
if your strength is the result of
a weak human honing themselves or not.

99
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,045
You say you're not much
different from humans,

100
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:22,466
and if so, I must pay respect
to your effort, that's all.

101
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,096
You think the same way as I do!

102
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:32,351
One may be born with strength,
or acquire it from nurture.

103
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:37,106
Majin are often weak because they rely
too much on what they've always had.

104
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:42,028
That's why they judge someone's strength
based solely on their magicule capacity.

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,975
True strength is something
can't be seen with the eye!

106
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,420
I see.

107
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:51,428
So that means I can become even stronger?

108
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:55,207
Yes, precisely!

109
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,085
Nothing beats real combat experience.

110
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,964
I'd be happy to spar with you.

111
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,246
So come at me!

112
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:05,037
Lady Suphia and me at the same time?

113
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:07,889
Are you sure you aren't
being a little too conceited?

114
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,186
Lady Suphia?

115
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,934
We'll tackle him together.

116
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,519
He's strong.

117
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,506
Let's admit that!

118
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,732
As expected from The Three Beastketeers.

119
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:50,638
Your strength does rival mine.

120
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:54,162
But now, my victory is assured!

121
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,841
What did you say?

122
00:07:56,686 --> 00:08:00,147
Did you think this magic sword
was my only trump card?

123
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,483
You're undoubtedly strong.

124
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,694
Strong enough to hold me back.

125
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,333
I'll admit that.

126
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:10,342
However, what if there were two of me?

127
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:22,211
Artifact, Doppelganger!

128
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,088
Is that even allowed?!

129
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,402
Well?

130
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:29,051
If you're smart enough to
bow before me, then I--

131
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,177
So what?

132
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,512
What did you say?

133
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,890
Just as I expect from a majin
who serves one such as Clayman.

134
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,470
What a cheap trump card!

135
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,525
Then... DIE!

136
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,532
Wait, Albis!

137
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:02,543
I permit you to leave,
so move out immediately!

138
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:05,129
You don't need to tell me that, ma'am!

139
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,946
Riders, retreat!

140
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:14,748
You fool! You think you can
take us on alone?!

141
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,361
We will make you regret that!

142
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:27,446
Die! You horde of moron!

143
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,626
How dare you!

144
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,079
Surrender.

145
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,875
Do so, and I will at least
spare your life as a prisoner.

146
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:43,709
No way--

147
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:51,092
M-My doppelganger!

148
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:02,251
I-I can't move my limbs!

149
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:07,361
I can't even defend myself at this rate!

150
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:12,446
So this is the strength of
The Three Beastketeers?!

151
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:15,783
I-I surrender!

152
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,992
I accept your--

153
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,996
You know I would never
permit that, don't you?

154
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:29,501
My paralyzed right arm
is moving on its own!

155
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,802
What is this orb?

156
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,900
I don't recall ever having this with me!

157
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:38,978
Could this be...?!

158
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:40,751
Eh? Stop it!

159
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:42,560
Please stop it!

160
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,146
Great Clayman!!!

161
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,579
What are you doing?

162
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,759
What is going on?!

163
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,048
Huh?

164
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:35,259
Th-This is...

165
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:37,948
Charybdis!

166
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:54,614
Wha--

167
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,618
O-O-Ouch...

168
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:04,196
What's wrong? Is that all you got?

169
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:06,477
I'm still not running out of breath.

170
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,259
Th-That is...!

171
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:22,034
All of you! You may use healing magic!

172
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:25,704
Stand up!
Stand and wake everyone around you!

173
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,681
That thing is bad news,
Father Middray.

174
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,501
The reading I'm getting is huge.

175
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,962
I know.

176
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:39,468
That must be Charybdis, the same thing
Lady Milim defeated not a while ago.

177
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,938
The monster that once revived itself
using idiot Phobio's body as its vessel?

178
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,556
But I thought Demon Lord Milim
destroyed the damn thing!

179
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,310
Yes, Lady Milim had certainly
defeated it before.

180
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,561
Calm down.

181
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,440
It's not the real thing, but rather one
made with a fragment of its power.

182
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,234
Let's see...

183
00:12:55,234 --> 00:13:00,447
It looks unstable, so it's likely
to disintegrate in less than a day.

184
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,658
No, this is the battlefield.

185
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:06,412
If things go wrong,
it might start evolving rapidly.

186
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:10,728
Better not give a monster like
that the food it craves.

187
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,439
Eh? Us, too?

188
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,731
-Really?!
-Much appreciated.

189
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:18,689
I'm back!

190
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,432
You monster!

191
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,476
Those who can teleport out might be fine,

192
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,397
but everyone else... would die!

193
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,232
So annoying!

194
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,657
Curse you Clayman, you bastard!

195
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,005
This is...

196
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,034
It seems to be using
Yamza as its substitute core.

197
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,130
That seems to be the case.

198
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:51,595
And here I was hoping I could
kill that bastard Yamza myself.

199
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,543
But his soul's already been consumed.

200
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,545
With how it is now,

201
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,995
we should keep the damage to
a minimum and wait for it to fall apart.

202
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,675
You hear him.

203
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,635
You may put on your gear.

204
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,012
Don't be greedy.

205
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,057
If buying time is all we need,
that won't be a tall order.

206
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,683
Sir Middray!

207
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,894
Let us help you out.

208
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,687
We fought against it before.

209
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,232
Just watch out for its scale attacks
and you will be fine.

210
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,228
Indeed.

211
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,950
I will also help you guys retreating!

212
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,118
All right! Let's go!

213
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:24,267
Yeah!

214
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,907
Dammit! I must at least
go save those I can--

215
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,917
You're going against your order, Albis.

216
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,796
I told you to retreat when you
feel you're about to lose, didn't I?

217
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,720
Sir Benimaru!

218
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,145
Eh?

219
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:57,457
He slashed it?!

220
00:14:57,511 --> 00:15:00,355
And he stopped it from
regenerating with his black flame!

221
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,153
Charybdis.

222
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,019
Just the right opponent to
test my current power on.

223
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,742
But we don't have time for that.

224
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,129
Let's finish this right away.

225
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,870
My apologies.

226
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:16,333
I was hoping to play with you once
you've achieved your complete form, but...

227
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,337
Vanish!

228
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,391
Hell Flare!

229
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,435
Unbelievable!

230
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,647
Albis, I have a business to take care of.

231
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,855
Return and command our entire force
as the vice-commander immediately.

232
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,777
U-Understood, Sir Benimaru.

233
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,871
Unbelievable!

234
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:52,496
He just pulled off the most
unbelievable thing like it's nothing!

235
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:55,308
What is he, a Demon Lord?

236
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,291
It might be easy for Lady Milim,

237
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,043
but can a regular majin do such a thing?

238
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,212
He's a monster, no doubt.

239
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,548
That looks like Sir Benimaru's attack.

240
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:08,093
Hey, just what's going on?
Someone tell me!

241
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,925
Let's see... I would love to, but...

242
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:15,035
It looks like we don't need to.

243
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:23,233
Hey.

244
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,111
It looks like you've been
keeping my friends company.

245
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,822
Th-This is the guy...

246
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,410
Sir Benimaru, wait!

247
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,300
These people here serve Lady Milim!

248
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:42,461
They're the priests of the Dragon Faithful!

249
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,880
What? Lady Milim's?
Then that means...

250
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,222
Yes!

251
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:50,466
They healed our wounds with
their healing magic, as well!

252
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,082
Everyone is all right!

253
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,714
No need to worry.

254
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:55,035
I see.

255
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,160
It seems I've jumped to conclusions.

256
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:00,521
You seemed to be the quite
a threat in this battlefield,

257
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,363
so I couldn't help but be alarmed.

258
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,693
You didn't jump in conclusions at all.

259
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:12,168
We only perform healing to prepare for
what we thought was an oncoming disaster.

260
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,410
I see.

261
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,244
So what now?

262
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,703
You still want to fight us?

263
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,370
Let's see...

264
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,097
What should we do, I wonder?

265
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:25,730
We would prefer not to cause
trouble with Lady Milim's forces.

266
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,757
Let's see...

267
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,842
I would love to fight you,

268
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,512
but it's not like I want to
wage war with you.

269
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:37,641
I just simply want to see
which of us is superior.

270
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:40,652
I understand that feeling.

271
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,207
Whooooaa!

272
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,855
There, there, there!
Not good, Father!

273
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,821
He is right, Sir Benimaru!

274
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,781
Do you know what
calamity would fall on us

275
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,284
if you hurt Lady Milim's followers?!

276
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,120
Sir Rimuru is Lady Milim's friend!

277
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,747
It would all end in tragedy,
I'm sure of it!

278
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,541
-I know!
-Yes, I know!

279
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,463
I'm sure I'd lose if I don't come at
him with my full power, anyway.

280
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,425
And I don't like engaging
in losing battles.

281
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,427
Quite so.

282
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:21,822
And I'm not sure even I could withstand
a blow like the one that buried Charybdis!

283
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,471
What a surprise.

284
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:34,416
Yamza's betrayal was nothing but expected.

285
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:37,492
But they took down Charybdis so easily!

286
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,564
Right?

287
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,371
Not even we could pull a kill like that!

288
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,417
Clayman's forces are destroyed.
This mission is a failure!

289
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,003
The losses are immense!

290
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:52,799
He really should have just sat down
and played nice like he was told to.

291
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,426
Yes, yes!

292
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,869
Even Laplace warned him, too.

293
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:59,228
Clayman got no one to blame
but himself this time!

294
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,189
Which means...

295
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,619
We'll need to report him about this,

296
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,854
so I'm afraid the playtime is over.

297
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,236
Y-You think we will let you escape?

298
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,619
I knew you guys were bad news.

299
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:23,163
If I can keep you here, I'm sure Albis
and Suphia will show up before long.

300
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,291
We've got Sir Benimaru, too.

301
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,709
It's over for you!

302
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,627
Just give it up already, black kitty!

303
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,986
G-Geld!

304
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:25,557
We weren't ordered to kill you this time.

305
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,018
So we will spare your life.

306
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,259
You better be grateful!

307
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:36,041
If we were serious, neither of you
would even be in this world by now!

308
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,287
A total defeat.

309
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:49,124
I had obtained more strength, but
I suppose there's always someone above.

310
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:54,129
No, Geld. If you hadn't been here,
I'd probably be dead right now.

311
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,299
Sorry to drag you down.

312
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,426
Not at all.

313
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:03,472
We might lost the fight,
but we're still alive.

314
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,974
We just have to win the next time.

315
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,361
Yeah.

316
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:09,479
You're right.

317
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,541
Sir Benimaru, the jesters got away.

318
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,110
I saw.

319
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,273
They might think they're
letting us alive.

320
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,740
How naive of them.

321
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,992
Treat the prisoners with full care!

322
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,557
Heal those who are injured!

323
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:28,580
Geld.

324
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,907
Thank you for keeping Phobio safe and
unveiling what the enemy is capable of.

325
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:41,268
Great Rimuru will analyze this and
unravel the secret of their strength.

326
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,059
I had hoped to settle the score
with them here in this place.

327
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,533
But I was not strong enough.

328
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:54,025
However, I will win next time!

329
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,322
That was tiring.

330
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,994
You're right.

331
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,950
The more you got hurt

332
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:22,427
That seed of hope

333
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,989
You plant on both of your hand

334
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:31,239
Will surely bloom someday

335
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:37,250
Whatever it is,
it doesn't have to last forever

336
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,736
As long as it makes you smile

337
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:47,528
To find the meaning behind
that fleeting moment

338
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:53,653
Let's go on a journey

339
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,458
Together

340
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,963
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

341
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:04,551
Above the shadow you cast

342
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,219
Reincarnate

343
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:14,311
The full bloom flower will paint
color on this dreary world

344
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:18,737
If you were reincarnated

345
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:23,445
I'd be with you wherever you go

346
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,239
Our souls are connected

347
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:32,151
I'll always by your side

348
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:39,252
Next time, "Adalmann, the Index Finger."
