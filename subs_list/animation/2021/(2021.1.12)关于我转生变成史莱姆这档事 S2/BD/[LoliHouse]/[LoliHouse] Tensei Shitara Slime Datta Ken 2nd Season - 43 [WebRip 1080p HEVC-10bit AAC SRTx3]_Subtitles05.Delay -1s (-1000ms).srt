1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:05,476
(Great Forest of Jura - Treant Settlement)

2
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:18,478
I made an orb based on Beretta's
Holy-Demonic Chaos Core...

3
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:21,731
and have Treyni dwell her soul within it.

4
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:30,703
After that, I enclose her holy energy
with an equal amount of my aura.

5
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:38,787
Then finally, I put the completed Chaos Core
into the doll I made with the Dryas tree

6
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:41,376
that was originally Treyni's true body.

7
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:11,406
Thank you very much, Lord Rimuru.

8
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:14,547
Thanks to you, I was able to
evolve into Dryas Doll Dryad.

9
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:19,539
Now I'm able to accompany Lady Ramiris
without any concerns.

10
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,167
So this means Treyni is now
free to go anywhere she wants?

11
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:26,337
So she can leave the Forest of Jura now?

12
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:31,050
Yeah, since it sounds like Walpurgis
will be held in an isolated space.

13
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,180
There is a chance that Treyni can't
enter because of that, so just in case.

14
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,438
Isn't that great, Treyni?

15
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:40,563
Yes, Lady Ramiris!

16
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:44,117
So everything is coming
along for the big event.

17
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,344
The banquet of Demon Lords,
Walpurgis is tonight.

18
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:53,188
It's finally time to put
an end to this whole ordeal.

19
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:17,376
Fate repeats all over again

20
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,751
The voices of my heart say

21
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,914
Time is not enough, it's over

22
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:28,337
Belief that makes me who I am

23
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,696
Light doesn't fade away

24
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,540
Made my mind up now, it's better

25
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:39,025
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

26
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,948
Lured by your hands

27
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:44,532
Even if it rains don't be swayed

28
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:46,579
Being same as always

29
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:49,267
Want to feel my destiny

30
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,892
Open my eyes to be braver

31
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:55,094
Get up now Get up now stronger

32
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,394
I believe in myself

33
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,620
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

34
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:03,361
I'll never run away

35
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:08,025
I might lose control

36
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,204
It's a perfect world

37
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:19,727
Destroy all of it,
in the end it's for our good

38
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:22,907
Let me shout like flames

39
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,832
(Episode 43: The Starting Signal)

40
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,585
I stationed our troops at
the entrance of forest.

41
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,668
Got it.

42
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,210
We had fast lycanthrope warriors
to disguise as refugees

43
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:37,510
and lure the enemy into Geld's trap.

44
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,721
We will take all of them down in one go.

45
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:43,224
The desolated land that
were once my homeland,

46
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:47,019
the ruins of the fallen Orc kingdom,
the Kingdom of Ordic

47
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,656
shall be a suitable graveyard
for Clayman's army.

48
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:58,072
So the country destroyed by Clayman's
scheme will be the place of the battle.

49
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,200
It's like karma.

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,302
Yes.

51
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:05,496
We've also completely
measured the enemy's ability.

52
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,246
Our victory is guaranteed.

53
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,739
But the battle hasn't even started yet.

54
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,836
You sure sound confident about this.

55
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,088
Thanks to your awakening,

56
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,175
I've obtained the Unique Skill
Born Leader.

57
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:21,820
So I'm now able to read enemy's movement
like they're in the palm of my hand.

58
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:24,251
Good grief.

59
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,642
Well, that's just so like him.

60
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:32,671
As such, I came out with a plan.

61
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:33,939
What is it?

62
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:39,614
I figured we might as well destroy Clayman's
castle that's believed to be behind the fog.

63
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,515
Might as well?
It's too dangerous.

64
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,710
It will be fine.

65
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:45,870
Soei and Hakuro will be going.

66
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,095
-They both are geared up to go--
-Dear brother, wait!

67
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,081
What is it, Shuna?

68
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,860
Don't ask me that!

69
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:58,966
Demon Lord Clayman has the dangerous
power to bend people's minds, isn't he?

70
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,158
If Soei and Hakuro were
to fall victim to that...

71
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:04,229
It's fine, I'm sure they will be fine--

72
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:05,254
No!

73
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,237
And if you still insist...

74
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:10,705
I'll join them!

75
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,994
Hey, hey!

76
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:15,066
So that's why, Great Rimuru.

77
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,775
Please give me the permission to go.

78
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:23,491
I don't want to send Shuna
to a dangerous place.

79
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:30,096
But it is the perfect chance to strike
when Clayman is not in his castle.

80
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,250
Great Rimuru.

81
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,455
Please rest assured.

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,932
I shall be with Princess Shuna
and protect her.

83
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,714
So am I.

84
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:43,024
There is a chance Lord Carrion is being
held captive in enemy's stronghold.

85
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,471
I feel we do need to investigate.

86
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,516
Great Rimuru, I'm also angry, you know?

87
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:52,377
It's difficult for me to just
hold my anger towards Clayman!

88
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:55,924
There, there.
I understand your feeling.

89
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,693
All right.

90
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,690
You can go with them.

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,815
Thank you very much!

92
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:06,596
Shuna's safety is a top priority,
you hear me?

93
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:09,783
Thank you very much for accepting
Shuna's selfish request.

94
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,039
I can use transportation spell,

95
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,212
so I can just transport out
if something bad happens.

96
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:17,955
She's right. I might get left behind, even.

97
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:25,354
We have resistance towards mental attacks,
so I doubt we would lose that easily.

98
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:28,598
But if Princess Shuna is with us,
there is nothing to fear of.

99
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,143
We can think about what to do with
Sir Carrion when we find him.

100
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,645
Make sure to have your eyes
on the situation all the time.

101
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,315
You guys will begin
operation at midnight.

102
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,400
Right after Walpurgis begins!

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,255
Understand?

104
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,028
Roger that!

105
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:47,700
On another note, there's around a hundred
of Dragon Faithful joining Clayman's army.

106
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,791
Dragon Faithful? What is that?

107
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:53,039
It is the name of those who worship
the Dragon Princess, Lady Milim.

108
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,791
So they're subjects of Milim?

109
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,565
But she doesn't have subjects, does she?

110
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,182
So they're just simply people who
worship her on their own?

111
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:05,651
Oh well, a hundred of them
should be no problem.

112
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,676
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,799
Well then, let's finish
your suit right away!

114
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,698
Don't move, okay?

115
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,539
Just as planned.

116
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,844
Clayman's army is being
lured into Geld's trap.

117
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:49,428
It's almost more difficult for us to lose.

118
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,430
It appears to be decided.

119
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,018
By this point, I see no way for
the enemy to recover itself.

120
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,436
Say, Lady Albis.

121
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,231
Please just call me Albis.

122
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,551
Sir Benimaru.

123
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,068
You're not my subordinate.

124
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,734
Yes, that's right.

125
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:10,854
However, we lycanthrope are
now under your command.

126
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:12,878
I see.

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,123
Very well. Then I appoint you
as the vice-commander for this battle.

128
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,847
I appreciate it, Sir Benimaru.

129
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,170
That said, there isn't much
work left for you to do.

130
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,105
This is nothing but mere
task waiting to get done.

131
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:28,015
Yes, I agree.

132
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,261
However...

133
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:33,848
I do sense the presence of several
strong members on their side.

134
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,016
Yeah.

135
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,915
Once the outcome is set in stone,
I will send Geld's troops their way.

136
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,176
Hold on!

137
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:41,467
Please let us do that job!

138
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:43,238
We beg you, Great Commander!

139
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,150
The is the land of Lycanthrope.

140
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:48,705
If we leave it all to you,
Great Carrion will scold us a big time!

141
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:54,452
Sir Benimaru.

142
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,704
I leave command of the armies to you.

143
00:08:56,704 --> 00:09:01,250
Please allow the three of us to target
and defeat the enemy's commander!

144
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,609
We beg you!

145
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,756
So that's why you hand the position
of the Great Commander to me?

146
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,923
Oh my, how do you mean?

147
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,019
Very well.

148
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:18,021
I was planning to have you join
the fight anyway, so it's not a problem.

149
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,395
However, if you feel you're
about to lose, retreat at once.

150
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:25,090
I see there are opponents to not
be taken lightly among them.

151
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,544
Yes, we understand.

152
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,821
It's almost time for the trap.

153
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,449
What should we do to those
caught in our trap?

154
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,202
I would love to kill all of them,
however...

155
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:38,746
I would like to leave the judgment
to you lycanthropeers.

156
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,247
Meaning?

157
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,875
Take anyone willing to cooperate
with us as prisoners.

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,963
I imagine Great Rimuru pictures
them as a potential source of labor.

159
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,551
You're going to rebuild
your capital, aren't you?

160
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,478
The more able workers, the better.

161
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,598
He thought things that far ahead?!

162
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,893
Even when facing the cunning Demon Lord
Clayman and his underlings,

163
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,771
he already thinks about what
to do after winning.

164
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,898
Where does that confidence come from?

165
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:09,819
Well, assuming our strategy
goes as planned.

166
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:12,735
It's time.

167
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,478
Geld, you may begin.

168
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,110
Yes, sir!

169
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:19,931
Start it now!

170
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,363
-What's this?!
-What is happening?!

171
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,309
That was close!

172
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,782
Don't let any one of them escape!

173
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,466
We got it!

174
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,783
Vortex Crush!

175
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,278
Sir Gabiru, you're so cool!

176
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:07,691
Hey, that's dangerous!

177
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,971
To think it would be this one-sided...

178
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:37,996
We won.

179
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,407
Wonderfully done, truly.

180
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,446
Of course.

181
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:46,040
Which is why we can't afford
to let our guard down.

182
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,459
I will now go to do my work.

183
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,629
Albis, Suphia, Phobio,
The Three Beastketeers!

184
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,131
You are now free to do whatever you want.

185
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,175
Bring me the head of the enemy leaders!

186
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,856
That's what I've been waiting for!

187
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,208
Now we can finally have some fun!

188
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,600
I can smell those bastards who
tricked me, I will go after them first!

189
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,120
I shall go, too.

190
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,967
We will leave the rest to you,
Sir Benimaru.

191
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,045
Go!

192
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,391
Yes, sir!

193
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,514
We will give you a hand, Lady Suphia!

194
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,903
Oh, Gabiru!

195
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:34,696
Sorry, but you might end up with
the short end of the stick here.

196
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:35,964
No problem!

197
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,752
You guys better be ready!

198
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,184
Father Middray, this looks bad.

199
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,674
They're totally losing over there.

200
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,822
Our side was supposed
to have the initiative,

201
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,032
and yet it's a mess after we started.

202
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:08,205
Weak, too weak!

203
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,665
I had no idea the Demon Lord Clayman's
soldiers would be this incompetent--

204
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,044
That's not the problem, Father!

205
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:18,021
The enemy just had the superior strategy!

206
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,091
You fool!

207
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,969
Any underhanded tactic means
nothing against absolute force!

208
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:25,547
It might be so if it was
a duel or a one-on-one,

209
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:30,144
but in mass combat like this, the army's
command is what will decide the day!

210
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:33,438
And our enemy won with
their ability to spring a trap on us!

211
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,650
You don't have to tell me that.

212
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,785
Anyone can tell that from a glance.

213
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,113
-Anyway--
-I know.

214
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:45,287
They're strong.

215
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:49,384
I don't feel like it, but if they're
going at us, then it can't be helped.

216
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:52,231
Let's give them a warm welcome.

217
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,752
But you sure look like
you're enjoying it.

218
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,839
Roger that.

219
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:10,677
Found them.

220
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,440
Hey.

221
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,478
I owe you one from last time.

222
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,051
Tear, the Teardrop Jester.

223
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,322
Footman, the Angry Jester.

224
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,749
Oh-ho?

225
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:27,951
Well, well, if it isn't Sir Phobio!

226
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,738
Sir Phobio, he who failed
to become a Demon Lord!

227
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:34,333
Sir Phobio, he who lost
to Demon Lord Milim!

228
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:39,679
Thank you so much
for helping us out back then!

229
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:43,675
I'm glad that you remember me.

230
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:48,499
I'd be a shame if I killed you when
you had no idea why you deserve it!

231
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:51,988
Eh-oh? What is he angry about?

232
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,924
How odd!

233
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:57,162
What could this fool be so livid for?

234
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,393
Why is it? Oh, why is it?

235
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,257
Those raging emotions are so delectable,

236
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:06,780
but there exists no reason
for us to die here!

237
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,073
Isn't it? Isn't it?

238
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,184
Shut up!

239
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,797
I was indeed a fool
for letting you trick me,

240
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:15,992
but a fool like me doesn't need a reason
to give you guys the suitable payback!

241
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,948
You want to go with us?

242
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,370
You're weak, you shouldn't
push yourself like that.

243
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:26,077
That's not it, Tear.

244
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:30,278
Sir Phobio was trying to make us
laugh with a little joke of his.

245
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,848
He's fast!

246
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,158
Well, well.

247
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,368
Long time no see, Footman.

248
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,078
Do you remember me?

249
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:56,206
You were the Orc General, was it?

250
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,655
My, look how impressive you've become!

251
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,618
I'm here under Sir Benimaru's order.
Allow me to help you.

252
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,032
Ah, thank you, Geld!

253
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,110
I deemed them worthy as my prey.

254
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:16,768
Report!

255
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,861
White Tiger Claw, Suphia of the Three
Beastketeers confirmed at the rear!

256
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:24,026
And the Black Leopard Fang Phobio
seen in the eastern forest!

257
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,504
The Three Beastketeers?!

258
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:29,907
What now? Should I rely on
the Pointer Finger, Adalmann?

259
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:34,661
But there is no way I can get Adalmann
here in such a short time.

260
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,778
We already past the point of no recovery.

261
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,085
Great Clayman only accepts
subordinates who succeed.

262
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:46,459
If I come back to him alive,
he will just execute me over this defeat.

263
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:52,387
Even if I were lucky enough to survive,
I don't want to turn into a soulless puppet!

264
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,650
If that's the case, then securing
my own safety is a top priority.

265
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,479
As much as it vexes me,
I will admit my defeat here.

266
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,948
But I will reign victorious in the end!

267
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:07,561
Buy me some time!

268
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:10,989
I will return to our homeland and
bring Adalmann back with me.

269
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,534
-Adalmann!
-That Wight King?!

270
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,662
But I thought he was
bound to that place?

271
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:20,707
He should be able to summon dead spirits
and help us regroup our troops.

272
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,126
I will bring him here no matter what.

273
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,587
I leave command to you
while I'm gone.

274
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,361
Y-Yes, sir!

275
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,512
Since I swore loyalty on my own
accord, unlike the other fingers,

276
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,430
I'm not under surveillance.

277
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,977
Were I to go under hiding, Great Clayman
would struggle to track me down.

278
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,573
It's a shame to lose my position as
the head of the Five Fingers,

279
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:44,231
but staying alive comes first.

280
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,953
Maybe I could find some other
Demon Lords to work for--

281
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,245
The transportation spell is not working?!

282
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,087
Is this a Spatial Blockade?!

283
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,282
Hey, is there an enemy nearby--

284
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,587
Paralysis, poison...

285
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,423
...even petrification?!

286
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,908
Impossible! Everything was
completely fine just a while ago!

287
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,880
Albis!

288
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:33,334
This whole area is already
under her control!

289
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:43,420
Very well! I shall face you
with my full power!

290
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:51,676
I will survive this battle
and climb my way up again!

291
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:56,678
Albis, majin who serves
the Beastmaster Carrion!

292
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,219
As the valorous member of
The Three Beastketeers,

293
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:02,306
are you willing to duel with me?

294
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:04,311
Yes, of course.

295
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:09,816
Sir Yamza, head of the Five Fingers
beneath the Demon Lord Clayman.

296
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,236
I shall show you
how out of league you are!

297
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:19,098
This would prove once and for all who
stands above, Clayman or Great Carrion!

298
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:50,669
Fool! Do you really think those
tricks will work on me?!

299
00:19:57,622 --> 00:19:59,115
Got you!

300
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:09,271
An underhanded tactic
like that is not manly at all.

301
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:11,311
Who are you?!

302
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,637
I'm Gobta!

303
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,144
We were in hiding just in case
something like this would happen!

304
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:23,557
Oh my, and you didn't tell me?

305
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:27,179
I was wondering why something
didn't feel quite right.

306
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:30,689
Benimaru ordered us to.

307
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:34,067
But you noticed us from
the beginning, didn't you?

308
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,945
Out of my way, weakling!

309
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:47,657
The same force as my ice magic sword?!

310
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:49,992
You cheeky little weakling, how dare you!

311
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:52,153
This is bad.

312
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,340
I was lucky that he used a magical attack.

313
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:57,007
If it was his sword,
I'd be knocked out in one hit!

314
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,523
This calls for a retreat.

315
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:02,179
We should now go clean up
all other enemy majin.

316
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,245
This Yamza is strong, so don't--

317
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:09,728
He dodged my attack?!

318
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,528
That was close!

319
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,858
Sneaking their minions
into a one-on-one duel.

320
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,654
Oh, how The Three
Beastketeers have fallen!

321
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,365
Then let me serve as
an observer for this duel!

322
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:27,412
Thank goodness! Looks like I can get
away without having to fight this guy.

323
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,269
Oh my, you can have him if you want.

324
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:32,856
No! Please don't mind me.

325
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,365
Just go ahead and fight
to your heart's content!

326
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,570
Sorry we got in your way!

327
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:42,636
Thank goodness!

328
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,818
Now that's the end of my work.

329
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:47,891
There's no way I can compete
against a guy like that!

330
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,950
The more you got hurt

331
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,427
That seed of hope

332
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,989
You plant on both of your hand

333
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:31,239
Will surely bloom someday

334
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:37,250
Whatever it is,
it doesn't have to last forever

335
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,802
As long as it makes you smile

336
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:47,528
To find the meaning behind
that fleeting moment

337
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,653
Let's go on a journey

338
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,548
Together

339
00:22:55,573 --> 00:23:00,108
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

340
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:04,655
Above the shadow you cast

341
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,382
Reincarnate

342
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:14,377
The full bloom flower will paint
color on this dreary world

343
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:18,737
If you were reincarnated

344
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,548
I'd be with you wherever you go

345
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,378
Our souls are connected

346
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:32,151
I'll always by your side

347
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,502
Next time, "In the Land of Destiny."
