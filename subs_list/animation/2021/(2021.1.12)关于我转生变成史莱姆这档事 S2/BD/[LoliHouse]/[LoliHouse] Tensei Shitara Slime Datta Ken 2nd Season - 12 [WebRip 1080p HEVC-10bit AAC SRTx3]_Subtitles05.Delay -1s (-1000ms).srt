1
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:05,390
Starting this moment, we will
start our attack on them!

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,570
We will resurrect Shion and others!

3
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:14,609
Great Rimuru.

4
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:15,641
Mnn?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,890
I believe we should decide on a password

6
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:22,565
to confirm whether you still have you
sanity after becoming a Demon Lord.

7
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:23,961
Password?

8
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:25,828
Yes. For example...

9
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:28,492
"Shion's cooking is shit."

10
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:33,992
I will ask your opinion on Shion's cooking,
and you should answer "It's shit."

11
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,250
What kind of password is that?!
Shion would hate it!

12
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:39,428
That is why.

13
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:42,397
In hope she would get angry
and wake up to complain.

14
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,912
I-I see...

15
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:46,022
Got it.

16
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:47,233
Nnn?

17
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:49,498
Let's make this a success.

18
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,592
Yes.

19
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:11,310
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,315
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

21
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:21,070
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,989
Then it's not as fragile anymore

23
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:30,454
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

24
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:33,499
Beyond the page of the chapter

25
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:36,210
It's welcoming you with a smile

26
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:40,631
Whenever, as much as it takes

27
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:43,634
Let's start a new world

28
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:47,429
We're Storyteller

29
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:51,559
All the love, hope, envy

30
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,477
Even the song of despair we sing today

31
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:57,523
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

32
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:03,529
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

33
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:08,826
That's just sad

34
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:15,666
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

35
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:22,423
My real self, is now reborn!

36
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:27,774
(Episode 36: The Unleashed)

37
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,138
What happened?

38
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,996
What about everyone?
Did I manage to evolve?

39
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,026
Yes.

40
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,431
Evolution to Demon Lord;
Harvest Festival was a success.

41
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:41,944
I see...

42
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,457
Great Rimuru?

43
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,376
Are you awake now?

44
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,361
Good morning, Great Rimuru.

45
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,035
Good morning, Shion.

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,032
I'm glad you got back alive.

47
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:01,766
Yes! All thanks to you, Great Rimuru.

48
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:05,693
Listen, don't make me worry anymore.

49
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,021
It's an order.

50
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:09,691
Understood.

51
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:11,006
Never again.

52
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,927
- Great Rimuru?
- He's finally awake?

53
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:21,759
Great Rimuru!

54
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,608
As you can see, we all have been
resurrected in one piece!

55
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:31,255
We all, without a single soul left
behind, have returned!

56
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:33,774
Good.

57
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,429
Nnn?

58
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:37,773
You all somehow look...

59
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,346
...somewhat different?

60
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,778
Report.

61
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:47,079
Gifts were distributed to all creatures
within your genealogy,

62
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,111
leading all of them to evolve further.

63
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,443
I see.

64
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,971
And also, do you sound much more fluent now?

65
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:54,129
No.

66
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:55,997
I have always been like this.

67
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,581
Ergo, it's just your imagination.

68
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:00,095
I see, so it's all just in my head. Hahaha!

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,895
Like hell that is! You are speaking
more fluently now!

70
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,663
Report.

71
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:09,442
To tell the truth, the Unique Skill Great Sage
has evolved into Ultimate Skill Raphael.

72
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:13,295
Raphael?
Named after an angel, now that's cool.

73
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,026
There is no longer anything I can't answer.

74
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:17,315
I-I see...

75
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:18,806
I will be counting on you.

76
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,254
You are more fluent now, aren't you?

77
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
No. It's your imagination.

78
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,854
So you're really pushing that
idea through, huh?

79
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:27,817
By the way, Great Rimuru.

80
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,011
Just to make sure.

81
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:34,255
Let me confirm whether you still have
your sanity after evolving into a Demon Lord.

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,460
Eeh?

83
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:36,866
Shion's cooking is?

84
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:37,810
Eh?!

85
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:45,017
What is it about my cooking, Great Rimuru?

86
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:49,444
There is no way I can say it's shit
in this situation!

87
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:51,286
Great Rimuru, please answer me.

88
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,656
To see if you still have your sanity!

89
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,521
Benimaru!

90
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,020
Lord of Wisdom, Raphael!
It's your turn now!

91
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:01,973
Find me the best way to deceive Shion
with your marvelous wisdom!

92
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,388
Answer. The answer to that question...

93
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,651
The answer is?

94
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:06,994
...doesn't exist.

95
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:10,827
You piece of crap! Didn't you say there's
no question you can't answer a minute ago?!

96
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,736
So what is it about my cooking?

97
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,691
Ermm, well...

98
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,706
I bet he wanted to eat it.

99
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:22,424
He looked like he really missed your
food when you're still dead.

100
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:23,582
He trapped me!

101
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:26,486
You do? I will gladly cook you food!

102
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,555
Let me provide suggestion.

103
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:31,792
Raphael!

104
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:32,892
Would that be okay?

105
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,036
I see! As I expect from Lord of Wisdom!

106
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,871
Ah, yes, Benimaru.

107
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,448
I do remember the password
that you decided.

108
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:49,435
You told me that when you ask me about
Shion's cooking, I should answer with "It's shit."

109
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:53,680
That's what you told me, right?

110
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,620
Yes, none other than you!

111
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,293
G-Great Rimuru!

112
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:01,089
I remember it perfectly!
The password that you decided!

113
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:04,364
With this, you now know
I still have my sanity, right?

114
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,476
W-Wait, Shion.

115
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:11,102
G-Great Rimuru has only just awoken.
I'm sure he's still in a state of confusion.

116
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:13,348
Understood

117
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:16,467
Sir Benimaru... no, Benimaru.

118
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:19,780
I serve Great Rimuru directly,

119
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:22,508
so I do not need to refer
to you with honorifics anymore.

120
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:28,674
However, I will gladly feed you my cooking
until your stomach ready to burst.

121
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,775
Why did you do that?!

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,819
Just do your best not to die, okay?

123
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:41,375
It's easier said than done.

124
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:47,332
Well, I have been testing some of her food,
so I've developed Poison Resistance lately.

125
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:48,758
Poison Resistance?!

126
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,778
I might die for real this time.

127
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:54,767
Well...

128
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,189
You reap what you sow.

129
00:06:57,677 --> 00:06:59,442
Ah, that's right.

130
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:02,821
This is not the time to do this.
We still have problems to deal with.

131
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:03,933
Problems?

132
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,655
It happens during the past
three days you fell asleep.

133
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:08,797
I have been sleeping for three days?!

134
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:09,865
Yes.

135
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,703
Something serious has happened in
the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania.

136
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:28,240
My name is Milim Nava, a Demon Lord!

137
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,996
I hereby declare all agreements made between
myself and other demon lords are now void.

138
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:37,938
And I declare war to Beastmaster,
Demon Lord Carrion!

139
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,403
A war you say?!

140
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,883
The war will be in one week from now.
You better prepare yourself!

141
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,368
Wait Milim!

142
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:53,315
What the heck are you thinking?!

143
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,759
Did she say war, General?

144
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:59,116
You better let me have the first row.

145
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:00,360
Suphia, wait.

146
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,827
You don't know how much power
demon lord Milim has.

147
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:07,968
The entire Animal King's Brigade could
take her on and be wiped in mere seconds!

148
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:13,654
Phobio, you have seen Milim's power,
so I believe in your judgment.

149
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:17,116
So who do you think is stronger?
Milim or myself?

150
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:23,236
If I'm forced to give an answer...

151
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:28,470
Demon lord Milim does live up
to her title as The Destroyer.

152
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,318
I see. So you're saying
she's stronger than me?

153
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:34,460
Ah, no, I have certainly not--

154
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:39,228
To run from an enemy because of their strength
is not something a demon lord would do.

155
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,337
And here I get the chance to fight
the legendary demon lord.

156
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:46,198
There is no way I would throw
away this opportunity so easily.

157
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:51,323
Get in contact with that slime and have
our people take shelter in Jura.

158
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,993
This place won't be safe once Milim
and myself start our fight.

159
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:58,470
Also, I will be the only one fighting Milim.

160
00:08:58,495 --> 00:08:59,727
Eh? But...

161
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:00,703
Let me fight too!

162
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:01,778
Great Carrion, we--

163
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:06,836
Silence! I am the only one who is capable
of fighting the demon lord Milim Nava!

164
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:11,693
The rest of you should devote yourself
to protecting our people.

165
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,727
I forbid you from joining this battle!

166
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:15,599
Yes, sir!

167
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:18,053
Trust me. I will win.

168
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,256
I don't hate you, Milim.

169
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:23,768
We could've been a great friend.

170
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,005
It's a real shame.

171
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:28,151
Milim's declaration of war.

172
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,645
That was ten days ago.

173
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,427
And finally, three days go.

174
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:44,095
So, Milim. Why are you doing this?

175
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:50,202
You're not telling me someone
is controlling you, aren't you?

176
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,546
If so, it's quite a shame.

177
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:58,086
I wish I could defeat you at your full strength
and prove once for all that I am the strongest!

178
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:07,020
Behold! This is my unique skill,
Royal Beast Form!

179
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:10,951
I am the king of the demonic beasts,
the Beastmaster Carrion!

180
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:24,760
Now, Milim.

181
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:29,135
I have to say this, but now that I have shown
you this form, I will have to ask you to leave.

182
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:31,191
I won't hold back.

183
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,611
This is the end!

184
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,555
Prepare to disappear from this world!

185
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,460
Beast Roar!

186
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:04,264
Destroyer, Milim Nava.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,378
So that's your true combat form, yes?

188
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,158
It was fun. It has been a while
since my left hand went numb like this.

189
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,335
I'll show you my trump card.

190
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,415
Drago-Nova!

191
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:02,220
She's on a whole different level...

192
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:16,145
But... could she possibly be...

193
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,222
Could possibly be what?

194
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,236
I would love it if you tell me.

195
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:23,788
The Sky Queen, Frey!

196
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:25,546
Correct.

197
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,706
You too?

198
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,751
Oh my, me too as in what?

199
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,087
Could you perhaps tell me more about it?

200
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:40,839
So Eurazania has been destroyed?

201
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:42,089
Yes.

202
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:43,681
I saw it with my very own eyes.

203
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:48,769
Our people have evacuated in advance,
so they're all safe.

204
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:51,985
Have you got the refugees
the place to stay and food to eat?

205
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,731
Yes! I apologize for not confirming with
you beforehand, but all have been done.

206
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,671
I see. As I expect of you.

207
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,949
We appreciate your help.

208
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:06,939
But still... demon lord Frey is
working with Milim?

209
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:09,581
It's rare for demon lords to work together.

210
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:14,628
Furthermore, I thought Milim is the type who hate
working with others based on her personality.

211
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,349
Yeah, it is pretty odd.

212
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:20,611
I also don't think Milim would do
something underhanded like that.

213
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:22,469
And about that...

214
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:29,406
Demon lord Frey was not heading to her
domain nor Milim's domain.

215
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:31,314
Nnn? So you're saying...

216
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,111
The direction she goes to...

217
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:35,481
...was demon lord Clayman's domain.

218
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:36,568
- What?
- What?

219
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:40,585
I... I have to go for a moment--

220
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,666
Suphia, wait.

221
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:46,249
If you're going for revenge,
we should do it together.

222
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:48,176
Well, hang on.

223
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:52,453
If my guess is correct,
Carrion is still alive.

224
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:56,047
There's no way Milim would let
anyone cut her fight off like that.

225
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,681
There must be something behind it.

226
00:13:58,124 --> 00:14:01,301
Which is why you guys mustn’t
do anything reckless.

227
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:04,589
If we don't work together, we might
end up destroying the chance we got.

228
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:05,917
Understood.

229
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:06,930
-Yes.
-Got it.

230
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:12,353
Is demon lord Clayman pulling the strings?

231
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:16,965
Worst case scenario, we would have
to deal with three demon lords at once.

232
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,738
Well then, what should we do now...

233
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:26,249
What's wrong?

234
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,617
I'm glad that you are awake, My Master.

235
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:32,241
Nnn? Yeah...

236
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,824
Allow me to express my joy at seeing
you becoming a full-fledged demon lord.

237
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:38,283
Ummnn...

238
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,713
Who are you again?

239
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:47,262
S-Surely you jest...

240
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:51,011
Those words hurt my demon heart
more than anything else could.

241
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:55,479
He looks like a pretty high-level demon.

242
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,469
But I don't know this guy.

243
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:02,788
This person right here is the demon you
summoned by sacrificing the Falmuth knights.

244
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:05,151
Ah, I see. So you're still here, huh?

245
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:07,977
S-Still...?

246
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,267
I heard about how much you
helped out. Thank you!

247
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,171
No, it was hardly worthy of your praise.

248
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,544
And as for--

249
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,129
Sorry for keeping you for so long.

250
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:20,334
You can go home now.

251
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,133
Go... home...?

252
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:24,341
Yeah.

253
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,261
Nn? What's wrong?

254
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,555
Please, do not say such a thing.

255
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:34,722
As I had asked you before, I wish you to
bestow me the honor to join as your follower!

256
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,818
You want to be my follower?

257
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,730
No matter how you look at it,

258
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,521
this guy is not some ordinary
greater demon at all.

259
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,741
He should be something with a higher rank.

260
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,386
Hey, Ranga.

261
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,282
Did I really summoned this guy?

262
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,780
You certainly did.

263
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:51,034
I see.

264
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,638
Okay then...

265
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,746
I can't give you much,
but are you okay with that?

266
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,589
To be able to serve you is all the joy I need.

267
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:00,581
All right then.

268
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,882
I thank you, My Master!

269
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:07,134
Quit with that "My Master" thingy,
it doesn't feel right.

270
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,034
You can call me Rimuru. Just Rimuru.

271
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,173
Rimuru.

272
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,308
Such a sweet tone that name has.

273
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,810
Great Rimuru it shall be, then.

274
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,597
So what's your name?

275
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:22,725
Being a nameless demon is enough for me.

276
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,027
You don't have a name?

277
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,887
I will give you a name as your reward then!

278
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:31,351
Oh my, that is the greatest gift I could have!

279
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,998
Let's see... you're a demon, so
a demon-like name would be great.

280
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,820
Ah, then your name will be Diablo!

281
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,024
Diablo...

282
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,004
It flat-out means "demon,"

283
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,467
but there is a sport-car with that name,
so it shouldn't be a problem.

284
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,644
May you live up to that name
and serve me well.

285
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,398
It took around half of my magicule.

286
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,527
It took 30% of my magicule when I give
that Greater Demon Beretta his name.

287
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,737
So this one took less than I expected.

288
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:09,821
Report.

289
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:13,742
Now that you have evolved, you
have a much higher magicule stores.

290
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,325
Therefore, you can't compare
it simply like that.

291
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,913
How much do I have now?

292
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,414
Ten times more than before.

293
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:24,169
Seems like this guy will evolve
into some real monster.

294
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,838
Oooh!

295
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,092
He looks strong.

296
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:33,428
Diablo. It is now my name.

297
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,279
My heart is now filled with great delight,
Great Rimuru.

298
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,088
I promise to serve you will all my heart
and body from today forward.

299
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:42,931
Nice to have you.

300
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:47,612
So, it appears to me you have
something in your mind right now.

301
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:49,778
If you don't mind,
please let me hear about it.

302
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,074
It's nothing big... well, it is, I guess.

303
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,506
It's about the future.

304
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,821
As in?

305
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:58,185
We got too many troubles at once.

306
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:01,127
Demon lord Clayman's scheme.

307
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:04,148
The clean up for Falmuth kingdom.

308
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:09,663
And dealing with the Western Holy Church
that sees monsters as enemies.

309
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:11,922
I see.

310
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,439
Report.

311
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:16,430
I believe there is no need to worry
about the Western Holy Church.

312
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,431
Why is that?

313
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,391
The Analysis and Assessment of
the Unlimited Imprisonment that sealed

314
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,664
the individual Veldora will
be completed shortly.

315
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:26,606
Eh?! We can seriously
release Veldora now?!

316
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,722
Yes, seriously.

317
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:31,778
It was supposed to take a few hundred years.
Raphael really is something, huh.

318
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:38,758
Releasing Veldora is believed to provide suitable
restraint on the nearby Western countries.

319
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:42,469
True, the Church wouldn't be able to
do anything reckless when that happens.

320
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:45,229
Wait, you are speaking much
more fluently now!

321
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,987
No. It is your imagination.

322
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:48,146
Ah, fine.

323
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:52,547
Anyway, that sure opens up
our path to solution.

324
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,392
Okay, I think we can work this out.

325
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,879
Oh, has an idea come to your mind?

326
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,590
I've decided to become a demon lord,
in both name and deed!

327
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,337
As I expected of you, Great Rimuru.

328
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:07,963
I, Diablo, pledge my eternal loyalty to you.

329
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,905
Hmph! If so, then I, Ranga,
am My Lord's most loyal servant!

330
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:16,375
I got it, okay?

331
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:24,873
With that's settled, Ranga.
I will head off for a moment.

332
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:28,001
Tell everyone else to prepare a party.

333
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:28,877
Yes, sir!

334
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,379
Soei, are you here?

335
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,232
Here.

336
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,999
-Immediately...
-We will look for info about Clayman.

337
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:38,230
Oooh, no need for me to even say it.

338
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:40,806
That's a guy who can do his job, alright.

339
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,560
Okay, I'm going now.

340
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:46,635
After transforming into a demon lord,
all of my skill are now

341
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,608
united by my ultimate skill Raphael,
making it much easier to use.

342
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,086
My Gluttony has also evolved
into Beelzebub.

343
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,615
That means I now have two
ultimate skills under my belt.

344
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,644
This place sure takes me back.

345
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,381
It has been two years since then.

346
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,465
Report.

347
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,738
Analysis and Assessment of
Unlimited Imprisonment is complete.

348
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:21,054
I can finally fulfill my promise.

349
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,141
I will free you now, Veldora.

350
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:30,991
I grew taller?

351
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:37,188
Raphael, make a Body Double of me,
I'll make it as the vessel for Veldora.

352
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,493
Enhanced Replication activate.

353
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,846
Seems like I do look older.

354
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,034
It's supposed to be me, but man,
I look beautiful.

355
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,539
Okay, time to do this.

356
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:23,575
Please work.

357
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:31,604
Report. The soul corridor between Master and
the individual Veldora has been established.

358
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:55,498
I, the Storm Dragon
Veldora Tempest, have returned!

359
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:59,889
Anyone who opposes me will die!

360
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,503
I'm used to losing things

361
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

362
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,053
It's a blurry realism

363
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:30,100
Because it's not about me

364
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

365
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:39,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

366
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

367
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

368
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

369
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

370
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,426
If I can redo this world once again

371
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:09,806
I will paint that story with love

372
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

373
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,979
I will tell you

374
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,356
I will tell you one more story

375
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

376
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,863
I will tell you
