1
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:05,375
We believe Clayman's army will arrive at Eurazania in two days.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,703
So he took the first step ahead of us.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,688
Clayman...

4
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:12,680
He's craftier than I expected.

5
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:16,976
He must've planned this knowing that Walpugris will be held in 3 days.

6
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,603
So he could massacre the Animal Kingdom

7
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:22,804
without any interruption from other Demon Lords.

8
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:46,366
Fate repeats all over again.

9
00:00:46,438 --> 00:00:48,741
The voices of my heart say.

10
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,904
Time is not enough, it’s over.

11
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:57,327
Belief that makes me who I am.

12
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:59,686
Light doesn’t fade away.

13
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:02,530
Made my mind up now, it’s better.

14
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:08,015
Yeah I know it's not an easy road.

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,938
Lured by your hands.

16
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:13,522
Even if it rains don't be swayed.

17
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:15,569
Being same as always.

18
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:18,257
Want to feel my destiny.

19
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:20,882
Open my eyes to be braver.

20
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:24,084
Get up now Get up now stronger

21
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,384
I believe in myself.

22
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,610
Stand up now Stand up now shouting.

23
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:32,351
I’ll never run away

24
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:37,015
I might lose control.

25
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:43,194
It’s a perfect world.

26
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:48,717
Destroy all of it, in the end it’s for our good.

27
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,897
Let me shout like flames.

28
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:57,456
(Episode 41: The Eve of Battle)

29
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,604
Who's your favorite in this?

30
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:09,793
I like this one.

31
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,127
Hey, Raphael.

32
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:18,944
If Clayman successfully killed all the remaining resident in Eurazania,

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,319
will he be awakened?

34
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,701
Answer.

35
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,858
Although inefficient, he will be able to obtain a large number of souls.

36
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:29,967
The success rate would be 78%.

37
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,662
That's higher than a Pi.

38
00:02:33,514 --> 00:02:34,764
We must stop him at all cost!

39
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:39,021
Our nations might have only interacted for a short period of time,

40
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:40,951
but we've formed an alliance.

41
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,319
So I would like to involve myself on this matter.

42
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:46,327
Sir Rimuru!

43
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,483
Benimaru!

44
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,335
Yes, sir!

45
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:52,506
Stop them.

46
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,217
Yeah, you got it!

47
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,342
Ah, I mean...

48
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:56,905
Leave it to me!

49
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:02,999
So that's how we decided to foil Clayman's scheme, but...

50
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,116
No matter how we do it, we won't make it in time.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,991
It will be great if we all can just go there with transportation magic.

52
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:16,488
Great Rimuru, sending an army with transportation magic is too dangerous.

53
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,533
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to say--

54
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,451
Answer.

55
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:23,248
It is possible to transfer objects at a low cost with transportation magic.

56
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:27,827
It works by using a separate dimension to link two points together,

57
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:32,108
but it is unsuitable for transferring organic matter due to heavy magicule irradiation.

58
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:37,131
However, anyone protected by a Barrier would not be affected by the transport.

59
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:40,155
Those are the fundamental rules of transportation magic.

60
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,053
Umm, so what does that mean?

61
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:47,811
In other words, since Majin and monsters have natural magicule resistance,

62
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:51,639
anyone capable of erecting a Barrier can be transported with no problem.

63
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:56,486
A full-transportation spell that includes measures to protect its target

64
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,405
would also be possible.

65
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,741
Just to be sure, can you make such a spell?

66
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,910
Answer!

67
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,686
The spell has already been developed.

68
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,711
What?!

69
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:09,201
By combining it with Extra Skill Spatial Domination,

70
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:11,920
the required magical power has been greatly reduced.

71
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,420
Raphael is now developing new skills and magic without me even having to ask!

72
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:18,091
Raphael, I love you!

73
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,594
Thank you very much.

74
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,553
Great Rimuru?

75
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:22,997
Just like you said, Shuna.

76
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,849
It is too dangerous to use transportation magic on an army.

77
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,184
However...

78
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,311
However?

79
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,358
I just successfully develop a new skill that would make that possible!

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,787
-Oooh? -Oh my!

81
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,950
-Just now?! -Excellent.

82
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:43,288
Raphael did, not me though.

83
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:46,411
If we can send our army in time, then our win is in the bag!

84
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,663
I pity you, Clayman.

85
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,678
You would've won if it wasn't for my evolution.

86
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:55,395
Now I'm asking for your resolve.

87
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:58,951
We can transport our entire army over there at once,

88
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,967
but I haven't tested its safety yet.

89
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,889
But will you still trust me?

90
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,897
That goes without saying.

91
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,374
I have given you my loyalty.

92
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:11,638
As your loyal retainer, I would gladly die if ordered to.

93
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,176
We trust you.

94
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,491
How can we even doubt you at this point?

95
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:21,655
You have saved us once before, you won't be hearing any whine from us.

96
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:25,749
Oh dear, you're making it sounds like I have no choice but to agree.

97
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,897
Please let us rely on your power, Sir Rimuru.

98
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,201
All right!

99
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,264
I hear you loud and clear!

100
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,467
Time to turn the tables on Clayman!

101
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,093
Everything is up to all of you!

102
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:37,428
Win no matter what!

103
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:38,788
Yes, sir!

104
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:50,427
Good work on the meeting, everyone.

105
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,608
I'm sure there will be a lot of work tomorrow, but I'm counting on you.

106
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,662
Yes, just leave it to us.

107
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,195
If only we know Clayman's location.

108
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,398
We could just go straight to him and end this whole thing in one go.

109
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:05,210
But Clayman is going to participate in Walpugris, isn't he?

110
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:06,859
I fear we might miss him entirely.

111
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:07,914
You're right.

112
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,078
-Yes! -Shion!

113
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,218
Why don't we storm that Walpurgis

114
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:16,171
and slash Clayman along with any other Demon Lords who oppose us?!

115
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,030
Clayman himself is one thing,

116
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,671
but fighting other Demon Lords is not a smart move.

117
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,750
I, I see...

118
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,961
Umm, but going into Walpurgis might be a good idea!

119
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:29,805
Hey, Ramiris, you think I can participate, too?

120
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,883
Eh? You mean in Walpurgis?

121
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:36,229
I figured it might be fun to go see Clayman ourselves.

122
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,493
I'm sure the guy won't expect it!

123
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,569
I think it's okay.

124
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,030
But you can only bring two attendants with you.

125
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:48,024
We got a problem because of it before, so that's the rule now.

126
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:51,805
What do you think?

127
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,727
It is a wonderful idea.

128
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:57,922
If you may, I would be happy to join you at--

129
00:06:57,947 --> 00:06:59,289
Diablo, you fool!

130
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:01,774
I won't let anyone else accompany him, but me!

131
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,298
Either way,

132
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:06,217
even if we get into a fight, we can just defeat them.

133
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,961
To begin with, Great Rimuru himself would be more than enough.

134
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,179
Precisely!

135
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:13,211
I thought you were an idiot, but as a recruit, you have potential!

136
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,108
They somehow hit it off, huh.

137
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,110
There, there, no need to go wild.

138
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,664
We haven't decided on anything yet.

139
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:28,615
Besides, I already put you in charge of Falmuth,

140
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,659
so I'm not bringing you along either way.

141
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,244
That's true. I understand.

142
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,633
Still, isn't it dangerous?

143
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:37,828
No.

144
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,877
It's hard to imagine that Lady Milim would betray us.

145
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:44,547
The only thing we know is that she has defeated Demon Lord Carrion.

146
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:48,802
I think it's not a bad idea to pursue the truth on the matter at Walpurgis.

147
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,281
Yeah~.

148
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:55,684
I do think it's impossible that Milim would just do whatever Clayman says.

149
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,853
I mean, Milim is a self-centered gal.

150
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,523
Are you really the one to talk?

151
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:05,750
It's just unthinkable that Lady Milim would betray Great Rimuru!

152
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:08,985
I have no evidence to back it up, but I'm absolutely sure of it!

153
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:10,828
No evidence, huh...

154
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,524
Well, to be frank, I also don't think she betrayed me.

155
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,070
I decide to trust Milim.

156
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:22,210
But that doesn't mean we should just ignore her altogether.

157
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,562
I do think Ramiris made the right guess.

158
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,300
There is a high chance that Clayman is indeed the cause behind all these.

159
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,586
Right? Right, right!

160
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:34,556
That means Detective Ramiris's hunch was right the whole time!

161
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,836
Excellent!

162
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,867
Wonderful, Lady Ramiris!

163
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:46,063
That's why I will attend Walpurgis and try to win as much information as I can get.

164
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,719
But who should I take with me?

165
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,797
I can imagine her going berserk if I don't bring her with me.

166
00:08:55,822 --> 00:09:01,166
Well, it might give her the chance to have her revenge on Clayman for killing her.

167
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,688
All right, I will bring Shion and Ranga with me.

168
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,063
Thank you very much!

169
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,149
Just leave it to me, My Lord!

170
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,297
So you finally decide to take action, Rimuru!

171
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,182
No need to hold back, I shall come along with you!

172
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,477
Demon Lords are nothing to fear!

173
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:21,539
Well, hear me out, Veldora.

174
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:24,789
I want you to stay in this town and help defend it.

175
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,063
What?! But together we can crush those Demon Lords with ease!

176
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:31,071
Defending this town is also an important job.

177
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,172
In fact, it's the most important job there is!

178
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,711
The most important...

179
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:39,922
That's why I'm counting on you to stay here, okay?

180
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,706
Wait, Rimuru.

181
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,793
How about we bring Master Veldora as my attendant?

182
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,953
That'd make me feel a lot safer, too!

183
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:51,219
No, it's not like I want to go there just to babysit you.

184
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:55,189
Uweeeh?! That's so cold of you, Master!

185
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:57,142
Or more like, why is she calling him Master?

186
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,602
Veldora, we're actually planning to spread rumors about you.

187
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,232
We discussed that at the meeting earlier, so you knew that, right?

188
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,320
Of course!

189
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:13,274
Crap, now I can't tell him I wasn't listening!

190
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:17,117
And Clayman must be thinking like this.

191
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:21,492
"That Majin Rimuru is nothing but a small fry hiding behind Veldora."

192
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,203
What did he say?!

193
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,102
Clayman, how dare he?!

194
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,836
Hmph, that puny insect needs to learn his place!

195
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:31,485
Looks like I really should come to and kill him!

196
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,313
Good grief. Calm down, Shion.

197
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:38,012
That was just an example.

198
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:42,180
Having you come with me to the meeting will defeat the purpose of the rumor.

199
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,686
I see.

200
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,031
Well said, Great Rimuru!

201
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,108
He deserves to be punished for taking Great Rimuru lightly.

202
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,861
I'd love to make him atone with my own hands.

203
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,905
But I believe I should let my senior do the honor.

204
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,235
Oh, now that's the spirit!

205
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:02,370
So did they get along or not?

206
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:06,164
So you'll throw the enemy off guard to make negotiation easier, right?

207
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:08,320
Isn't that also dangerous?

208
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:11,421
It's okay, I actually can summon Veldora instantly with my skill;

209
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,423
Storm Dragon Summon.

210
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,672
Oh, really?!

211
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:18,564
I will ask for your help if things go south.

212
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,541
So I want you to defend this town until then.

213
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,445
I see! So I'm basically the hero who swoops in at the last second!

214
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:28,771
Isn't that a bit unfair?

215
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,773
Please call it smart.

216
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:34,750
Besides, that means you now have one extra slot for an attendant, no?

217
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,235
Smart idea, Rimuru!

218
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:40,336
So who are you going to pair me with?

219
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,742
Let's see, how about Haku--

220
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,125
A moment, please!

221
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:45,101
Lord Rimuru!

222
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,985
I hope you would give that role to me!

223
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:49,938
Treyni!

224
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,399
What a girl...

225
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,617
I beg you as well.

226
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:58,510
Please allow Treyni to accompany Lady Ramiris!

227
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:06,797
Well then, Treyni, I leave it to you.

228
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,117
-Yes! -Treyni!

229
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:16,236
Shion and Ranga will go with me to Walpurgis.

230
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:20,282
Along with Ramiris, Beretta, and Treyni.

231
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,661
And Veldora summon as our trump card!

232
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:35,343
Demon Lord Cromwell will also be at Walpurgis,

233
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:38,383
the man who have a strong connection with Shizu.

234
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:42,346
But my target this time is Clayman.

235
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:49,602
Clayman, you made me your enemy.

236
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,855
If you want to fight me, you better be prepared.

237
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,024
Since you lay your hand on my friends,

238
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,112
I will have you pay for the consequences.

239
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:02,492
(The Forgotten City of Dragons)

240
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,773
Those people drive me mad!

241
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:14,648
How dare they propose we work together?!

242
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:18,305
But Father Middray, failing to follow this order would put us in serious trouble!

243
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:23,219
Their commander Yamza have the decree from Lady Milim herself!

244
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,181
Shut up, Hermes. I don't need you to tell me that! I already know!

245
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:31,437
But still, destroying Eurazania? Lady Milim sure can be handful at times.

246
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,774
Watch your mouth, Hermes!

247
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,304
You should never cast doubt upon Lady Milim's action.

248
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,818
Well, that's true, but...

249
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,780
It's getting harder for me because you always spoiling her.

250
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:46,034
But still, Clayman. I can't believe him.

251
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,829
How dare he made Lady Milim write that decree!

252
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,455
You're right.

253
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:54,759
It's Lady Milim's writing for sure, and we can't say no since it's an order.

254
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:59,714
But Clayman's army eat so much they emptied three storehouses already.

255
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,493
That means we only have seven left.

256
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:04,135
Looks like things will be hard until the next harvest season.

257
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,637
Dammit!

258
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,478
A red melon...

259
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,110
Yamza, the Frozen Swordmage.

260
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,314
Keep your cool, Hermes

261
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,407
Roger that.

262
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:34,999
Father Middray, your support of supply is a great help.

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,630
With an army of 30,000, there's just never enough to go around.

264
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:43,954
It's an honor to be at your service.

265
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:49,305
But we're regrettably reaching the limit of what we can provide.

266
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,499
Lady Milim would be saddened if her people were to starve.

267
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:57,032
What are you saying? Your Milim stepped out of the line!

268
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,858
We're trying to clean up after her mess,

269
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,029
so why don't you at least show some respect?

270
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:10,498
Ah, my pardons.

271
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:14,309
We were only thinking about ourselves there for a moment.

272
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:17,054
We will provide you with all the support we can offer.

273
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,335
So please feel free to ask.

274
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,295
He didn't turn into a melon.

275
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,062
Well, if we make them angry,

276
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:26,634
they might use it as an excuse to destroy this country, after all.

277
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,030
I see.

278
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:31,222
Then allow me to give you the opportunity to help us out.

279
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,858
I'm sure you can at least help transport the supplies.

280
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,804
P-Please wait!

281
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:39,960
First, you took our supplies, and now you want to take our pe--

282
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,953
Shut up, garbage.

283
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,632
Oh, looks like you don't know your place.

284
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:58,390
Hurry to die, aren't you?

285
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,789
This bastard's really pushing his luck, huh?!

286
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:15,308
My apologies, Sir Yamza.

287
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,227
I will teach this fool to behave properly,

288
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,148
so I hope you will forgive him for my sake.

289
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,650
Always a pain having an idiot working for you, isn't it?

290
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,178
I will forgive him just this once.

291
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:28,210
We will depart tomorrow morning,

292
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:31,781
so all of you priests better prepare immediately!

293
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:47,590
You utter fool.

294
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,500
That's why I warned you.

295
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,679
I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.

296
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:55,140
Holy magic, Recovery.

297
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:00,726
All right.

298
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:04,524
Even if the priests are gone, it won't affect our people right away.

299
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:09,546
But that man, how dare he hurt a subject of Lady Milim!

300
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,081
Father Middray...

301
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:13,490
But that kick hurt like hell too, by the way.

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,382
You're right.

303
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:17,218
Do you mind if I kill him?

304
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,609
Fool! You won't stand a chance!

305
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:20,680
Yeah.

306
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:24,711
His sword looks like a hassle to deal with, and I'm sure he has more up his sleeve.

307
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:29,929
He's just like Clayman himself; he won't reveal his secret that easily.

308
00:17:29,954 --> 00:17:33,261
A man should secure victory without any secrets or tricks!

309
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,007
You're right.

310
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:39,468
Let's start the preparation right away.

311
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:41,562
Yes, sir.

312
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:48,511
But still, why Lady Milim hasn't returned?

313
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:56,112
How should we protect the people of Eurazania?

314
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,703
We need a safe location.

315
00:17:58,704 --> 00:17:59,954
Propose.

316
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,713
Transporting the resident to a single location would be efficient.

317
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:04,690
Eh?

318
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:07,003
Ah, that's true!

319
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:11,841
It's not like our army is the only thing we can transport!

320
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,553
Brilliant idea, Raphael! Truly, an egg of Columbus!

321
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,495
It's not such a big deal.

322
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,847
A-Are you sure?

323
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:22,425
Anyway, we just have to transport all the residents over!

324
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,456
All right!

325
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:30,956
After that, I had Geld to prepare a place that could accept the refugees.

326
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:34,103
Once it's done, I try out the new spell

327
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:38,377
and deliver the resident of Eurazania to Tempest soon after.

328
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:43,914
Thanks to Phobio, I was able to explain things to the resident pretty easily.

329
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,284
And everything went smoothly.

330
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,229
In the end, we continued to transport the resident without resting.

331
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:55,753
And successfully transported all remaning resident of Eurazania in one night.

332
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,665
Are you okay?

333
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,581
It was pretty exhausting.

334
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,643
How can you keep yourself together

335
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,396
using large-scale transportation magic like that over and over?

336
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,753
Well, about that.

337
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:09,778
Yes?

338
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,870
It's because I'm the leader of Tempest!

339
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,739
That's hardly an answer.

340
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,644
But I guess, that's part of the reason.

341
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,245
Anyway, we got no time to rest!

342
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,058
You guys still have more stuff to do, don't you?

343
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:27,425
Yes!

344
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:28,722
That's right.

345
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:33,214
The battle with Clayman's army awaits us.

346
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:47,061
Our forces includes Albis, Suphia, Phobio;

347
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:51,066
The Three Beastketeers and their army of 10,000 Lycanthrope.

348
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,683
The Goblin Riders led by Gobta.

349
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:58,901
The group of Ogre, a team of guards under Benimaru's command.

350
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:00,777
I named them Kurenai.

351
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,120
And 4,000 Hobgoblin.

352
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,354
I named them Green Numbers.

353
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,126
5,000 High Orcs led by Geld.

354
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,909
The Yellow Numbers.

355
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,755
The Dragonewts led by Gabiru.

356
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,966
The Hiryu.

357
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,886
An army of 20,000 in total.

358
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:24,597
And 100 of Shion's elite guard will stay to defend Tempest.

359
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:29,589
They're a team composed of the revived victims, so I named them Yomigaeri.

360
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:31,761
Great Rimuru!

361
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,649
We are all ready.

362
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,317
Our preparation is complete.

363
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,378
All right!

364
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,269
Well then, let's start transporting you guys right away!

365
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,347
Sir Rimuru.

366
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:43,644
We will never forget your kindness.

367
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:48,748
Now we can smash Clayman's underlings without any worry!

368
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,331
We will let you have him, so please give him a taste of our anger!

369
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,753
I'm counting on you.

370
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,769
There is no need for mercy, Benimaru!

371
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,400
You need to take care of the garbage fast before it starts smelling.

372
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,860
Please be careful!

373
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,698
I will show them hell so that they will never dare to defy us again!

374
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,339
All right!

375
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:24,800
Win!

376
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,847
Victory shall be yours!

377
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,144
Be safe and bring me victory.

378
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,950
The more you got hurt.

379
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:22,427
That seed of hope.

380
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,989
You plant on both of your hand.

381
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:31,239
Will surely bloom someday.

382
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:37,250
Whatever it is, it doesn't have to last forever.

383
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,802
As long as it makes you smile.

384
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:47,528
To find the meaning behind that fleeting moment.

385
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,653
Let's go on a journey.

386
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,548
Together

387
00:22:55,573 --> 00:23:00,108
I ride on that momentary whirlwind.

388
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:04,655
Above the shadow you cast.

389
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,382
Reincarnate.

390
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:14,377
The full bloom flower will paint color on this dreary world.

391
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:18,737
If you were reincarnated

392
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,548
I'd be with you wherever you go.

393
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,378
Our souls are connected

394
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:32,151
I'll always by your side.

395
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,252
Next time, "The Demon Lords."
