1
00:00:01,451 --> 00:00:04,357
The embassy from Animal
Kingdom of Eurazania sent

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:07,810
by the Demon Lord Carrion
has arrived in Tempest.

3
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:12,084
But, a lot happened right
after they arrived...

4
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,920
...and it ended up like this.

5
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:33,413
Well, it's partly my fault, to be honest.

6
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:58,150
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

7
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,155
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

8
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:07,910
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

9
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,829
Then it's not as fragile anymore

10
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:17,294
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

11
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:20,339
Beyond the page of the chapter

12
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:23,050
It's welcoming you with a smile

13
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:27,471
Whenever, as much as it takes

14
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:30,474
Let's start a new world

15
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:34,269
We're Storyteller

16
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:38,399
All the love, hope, envy

17
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,317
Even the song of despair we sing today

18
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:44,363
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

19
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:50,369
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

20
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,666
That's just sad

21
00:01:55,666 --> 00:02:02,506
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

22
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:09,263
My real self, is now reborn!

23
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:14,998
(Episode 26: The Trades with
the Animal Kingdom)

24
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,389
Is that all of Kijin's power?

25
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,788
Entertain me more!

26
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,701
That's my intention!

27
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,272
Prepare yourself!

28
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,373
That is?!

29
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,553
A giant Magic Shot?!

30
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:49,045
Hey, Shion! Wait!

31
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,366
Are you planning to blow
this whole area away?!

32
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,827
Crap, she's not listening.

33
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:57,154
Oh, nice! Come at me!

34
00:02:57,179 --> 00:03:00,318
That Suphia girl seems to be
excited to take it straight on,

35
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:03,443
but not even she would make
it out unscratched against that!

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,147
What should I do?
Should I stop them?

37
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:09,240
Take this--

38
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,545
That's it!

39
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,038
It should be enough.

40
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,100
"Beast Transformation," huh...

41
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,827
Let's end it here.

42
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:30,747
So, did we pass?

43
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,084
Yes.

44
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:34,217
Then it's over.

45
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,444
M-Mister, what does that mean?

46
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:40,741
Seems like they were testing us.

47
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:44,639
We have no complaint.
You guys are pretty strong.

48
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:48,022
You all have the right to stand
on equal footing against us.

49
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:49,803
You guys have convinced me of that.

50
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:55,404
I hereby declare that we will now treat
the ruler of Jura Tempest Kingdom,

51
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:58,037
Rimuru Tempest and his friends
on the same level as Great Carrion.

52
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:58,920
You got it?

53
00:03:58,945 --> 00:03:59,709
Yes, ma'am!

54
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,592
Like what Lady Suphia just said.

55
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,100
It's rare to meet a human like you
who could fight one on one against me.

56
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:07,604
It's my honor.

57
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,479
I was worried what would happen
right off the bat, but...

58
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,737
Good thing it all ended well.

59
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:19,338
Shion, you understand right?

60
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:21,292
Shion?

61
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:23,549
Well...

62
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,330
What should I do about this?

63
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:27,439
What?! It's about to explode?!

64
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,080
Can't you shut it off?

65
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:32,338
I can't! I'm at my limit already!

66
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:36,697
Great Rimuru, please evacuate.

67
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,076
C-Calm down!

68
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:41,532
Slowly, try to slowly
point that upward, okay?

69
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,260
U-Upward..?

70
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:46,416
Spirit! Push it with your spirit!

71
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:48,923
I don't think I can do it!

72
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:52,072
Oh well, that's Shion for you.

73
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:59,018
Shion, shoot it.

74
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:00,784
It's gonna be okay.

75
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:02,916
But...

76
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,526
Believe in me!

77
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,838
Okay! Here I go!

78
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,299
Gluttony!

79
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,190
There, it's over.

80
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,115
Impressive.

81
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:30,799
Seriously?!

82
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:36,145
It is to be expected from My Master.

83
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,713
Are you okay?

84
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:44,400
As expected from the man
acknowledged by Great Carrion.

85
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:49,409
It's a blessing to be able to
form a bond with you and your country.

86
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,785
Same goes for us.

87
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,690
Welcome to Tempest.

88
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:59,120
And thus, we welcomed
the envoy from Eurazania.

89
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,923
That night.

90
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:09,081
We held a modest welcome party
in the newly built Guest House.

91
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,549
This is great.

92
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:18,440
It's seasoned perfectly.

93
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,041
It got the right amount of salt.

94
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:22,150
I can eat these all day!

95
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,174
Delicious!

96
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,760
What a bliss.

97
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:34,416
She sure drinks a lot.

98
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,814
Just who the heck gave
her an entire barrel?

99
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:39,776
Meanwhile...

100
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,502
Is it okay for you guys to
show others that form?

101
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,299
It's not like it's a secret or anything.

102
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:53,870
I-I see...

103
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:55,120
But still...

104
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:58,776
We only show this form in
front of people we trust.

105
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,135
I see.

106
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:01,697
Oh well.

107
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:03,916
But still...

108
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:09,018
To think you would drink this
much of our apple brandy.

109
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,541
"This much"?

110
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,776
You don't make a lot of these?

111
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,752
Ah, sorry. Please, don't mind it.

112
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:19,068
We made those for the guests, after all.

113
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:23,420
But we rely on what the forest has
for us, so we couldn't make much of it.

114
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:27,487
Then I have a nice idea.

115
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:32,752
We have plenty of fruits
in Eurazania.

116
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,455
I'll have our men to deliver
some of it to you.

117
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,581
Really? Are you sure?

118
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:38,565
Yes.

119
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,104
Isn't that great, Great Rimuru?

120
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,213
Yeah!

121
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:48,557
I see.

122
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:52,041
So they want us to pass
some of the goods to them.

123
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,932
How about the rates?

124
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,338
I'll leave the details up to you.

125
00:07:57,448 --> 00:08:00,010
I'm fine with anything as long as
I get to drink nice things.

126
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:04,210
Fruits from Eurazania are of a high quality,
so you can some expect good stuff.

127
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:11,002
So they want us to work
on the numbers ourselves.

128
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:15,173
What would be the right rate
for exchange of goods?

129
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,634
Oh well, let's leave it to
the professional.

130
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:21,737
Shuna.

131
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:23,432
What is it, Great Rimuru?

132
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:24,916
Call Koby for me.

133
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,552
He's a Kobold merchant.
(Kobold merchant - Koby)

134
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:35,311
He opens a shop here in Tempest and is
currently handling the merchant affairs here.

135
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,049
G-Great Rimuru, what do you need me for?

136
00:08:38,074 --> 00:08:40,846
He's Koby, our merchants representative.

137
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,545
He used to do trades in
Demon Lord domain.

138
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,748
I'm appointing him to work
on the deals with you guys.

139
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,901
These two are the envoy
from the Animal Kingdom.

140
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:52,365
Please bring up stuff other than alcohol
that they might be interested in.

141
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,970
B-But the people of weak race are
not allowed to enter the Animal Kingdom--

142
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:59,596
I'll issue you a permit pass,
so feel free to come in.

143
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:02,268
I will also talk to Great Carrion
about you.

144
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:05,831
You look like a beastman anyway,
so I bet you will get along with them.

145
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,557
Anyway, I'm leaving it to you.

146
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,447
Well... ermm...

147
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:13,674
Okay.

148
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,588
I'll leave the rest to you young'uns.

149
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,198
Please excuse us.

150
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,940
Wha-, wait...

151
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,354
Great Rimuru!

152
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,112
Koby should be able to do it well.

153
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,008
Yes, you're right.

154
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:38,760
These kinds of stuff surprisingly go
smoothly with alcohol on the table.

155
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:43,440
And so, we all enjoyed
the party all night.

156
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:48,206
Things seem to go off smoothly for
our first formal meeting with another country.

157
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,799
Several days later.

158
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:57,682
Albis and Suphia returned to Eurazania.

159
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:02,416
We agreed to expand our
technology exchange.

160
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,049
These people remained in Tempest
to learn about our technology.

161
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,776
They're a diligent and kind bunch.

162
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:19,510
Just how does hot water come
out from this "faucet" thingy?

163
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,127
It doesn't look like it gets
boiled elsewhere.

164
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,315
It's Rune magic.

165
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,831
Rune magic?

166
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,229
Where did you put the Rune?

167
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:34,893
We engraved a Rune with heat magic
on the faucet handle.

168
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:36,573
I see.

169
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:40,348
So it will heat the water
when someone with magic turns it.

170
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:42,548
As expected from a Dwarf craftsman.

171
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:45,510
Well, this is nothing much.

172
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:48,612
It came from Mr.Rimuru's idea, after all.

173
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:50,244
(To be precise, it's Great Sage's idea.)

174
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:56,002
You're not going to look around
like the other guys?

175
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:57,861
It's not my duty.

176
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,611
The "Panther Fang" Phobio is
under a house arrest now,

177
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:03,931
and he told me to do something
useful for Lord Rimuru.

178
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,726
So that's why you join the town
security, huh?

179
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:08,369
Indeed so.

180
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:09,893
Grucius!

181
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,971
It's time for patrol.

182
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:12,932
Okay!

183
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,081
See you.

184
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,995
I guess I'll go take a bath
or something.

185
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:24,785
You got a sword training to do.

186
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,752
Yes.

187
00:11:31,643 --> 00:11:33,573
As for fractional division,

188
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:36,049
it's a bit hard to calculate it
as it is,

189
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:38,651
so lets try to turn it into multiplication
and start from there.

190
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,534
To turn division into multiplication...

191
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,440
They're taking the class properly
even without me.

192
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:56,049
And then, more days passed.

193
00:11:56,463 --> 00:12:00,604
Youm and his gang resume
their journey as a Champion.

194
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:05,190
And on the same day, Benimaru and
the rest of the embassy returned.

195
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,198
The Eurazania knights were as expected.

196
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:15,120
Each of them received proper training
from the Demon Lord Carrion himself.

197
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:18,315
To be expected from a Beastmaster, I guess.

198
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,823
Anything else?

199
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:20,768
Yes.

200
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:24,549
Their architecture is not much
compared to the one in Tempest.

201
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:27,580
However, their royal palace was
stuffed with luxuries

202
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:30,065
showing their remarkable
obsession with wealth concentration.

203
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,448
Riguru is doing so great!

204
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,252
Well, anyway...

205
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:42,010
However, it was not a bad thing
for them.

206
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,940
The residents actually wished for it.

207
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:45,215
I see.

208
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,270
Our architecture and crafts are on
a level above theirs.

209
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:54,473
In addition to Kaijin, we got Kurobei
and Shuna after all.

210
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:59,721
However, they have one thing that
is worth paying attention to.

211
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,870
And that is?

212
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:02,096
Their agriculture.

213
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,581
Oho!

214
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:08,284
They possess big fields that are
bigger than our whole country

215
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,215
and it's filled with colorful corps.

216
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:15,088
Can we learn anything from them?

217
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:18,854
I believe it's possible.

218
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,073
Great!

219
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:23,948
We will have the next embassy
to focus on their agriculture.

220
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,075
The food situation in our country
has improved a lot,

221
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:31,604
however, we still have a lot
of trails and errors to go through.

222
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:36,128
As such, this might lead to further
improvement on the situation--

223
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,041
Riguru is so--

224
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:43,237
Well then, I got to prepare for the trip
to the Dwarf kingdom.

225
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:44,909
So I'll leave the rest to you guys.

226
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,159
I'm counting on you.

227
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,245
Yes, sir!

228
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:53,643
Great Rimuru.

229
00:13:57,705 --> 00:14:04,025
If it is possible, could you appoint Riguru
as the head of the next embassy?

230
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:05,916
What do you mean?

231
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,752
I believe Demon Lord Carrion
is a man worthy of our trust.

232
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:13,026
They won't treat our emissary
in a rough manner.

233
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:17,533
Thus, it should be wise for me to
stay here and protect the country instead.

234
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:18,807
I see.

235
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:23,729
So you're saying that it should
be okay to leave the rest to Riguru, right?

236
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:24,737
Yes.

237
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,651
Got it. Then it's done.

238
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,057
Thank you very much.

239
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:33,729
But to think that you would
trust him this much.

240
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,900
Carrion must be a great king,
beyond his prowess.

241
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,306
Indeed.

242
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:42,416
The truth is, I tried to pick a fight
with him, but he laughed it off.

243
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,877
Wait, what did you...?

244
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,135
I couldn't use big moves like Hell Flare,
so they took me down pretty easily.

245
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:54,478
I still have long to go.

246
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,596
Oh my...

247
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:58,370
Ah, but I won against Phobio.

248
00:14:58,486 --> 00:14:59,877
I see...

249
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:03,370
Well, it sure is amazing that
you won against Phobio...

250
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:09,041
No good. As I thought, it was
wrong to let this guy go outside.

251
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,659
So after this and that...

252
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:15,471
The following day.

253
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:19,268
This time, I departed to Dwargon.

254
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,213
Hey, Ranga! Too fast!

255
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,057
Yes! Understood!

256
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,260
Ranga!

257
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:35,088
This time, we got Gobuta, Gobuzo, and
all six of Goblin Rider to accompany us.

258
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:36,541
Shuna and Shion.

259
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,370
And then, Kaijin, and Garm, Dord, and Myrd,
the three Dwarf brothers.

260
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,215
We're happy to be given the opportunity to go
and relax in Dwargon after such a long time.

261
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,034
It's true. You guys think so too, right?

262
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,557
Indeed!

263
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:57,127
I'm happy that you guys feel like that.

264
00:15:57,152 --> 00:16:00,791
Our country got this far thanks
to you guys, after all.

265
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:05,643
As a craftsman, it's really
a wonderful word to hear.

266
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:06,541
Yeah.

267
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:09,627
We're really lucky to meet you guys.

268
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,221
Mister!

269
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:19,252
By the way, we got the presents for King
Gazel packed on the two carriages behind us.

270
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:24,084
It would've been much easier to just
pack it all inside my stomach, but...

271
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,795
The modus is also important
in such occasion.

272
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,300
She scolded me.

273
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,133
As expected from the Ogre princess.

274
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:36,221
She learned stuff from Vesta recently,
and is now quite knowledgeable in manners.

275
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:42,589
By the way, it would've much better
to leave Shuna behind, but...

276
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,220
Princess Shuna and Great Rimuru
will go on a trip together?

277
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,721
No, it's not a trip. It's for a job.

278
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,581
That's unfair! Unfair!

279
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,690
It's unfair that only Princess Shuna
gets to play with Great Rimuru--

280
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,620
A job, okay? It's a job...

281
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,127
Ms.Shion is mad!

282
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,807
Please calm down!

283
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:06,448
Well, she would cry, scream,
and rage and all...

284
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,198
So, can I leave her in your care, Rigurd?

285
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:15,345
T-This is nothing...

286
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,463
I'm worried about Rigurd and others if
I left Shion behind, so I took her with me.

287
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:25,198
Well, she got the looks of a skilled secretary
as long as she keeps her mouth shut.

288
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:28,635
Everything should go well
if I keep watching on her.

289
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,932
Great Rimuru, look.

290
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:37,616
The road that got destroyed
during the battle with Charybdis

291
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:39,565
has been mostly fixed.

292
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,245
You're right. They sure work fast.

293
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,362
As expected from the Orcs.

294
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,807
Right according to the plan.

295
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:57,557
Sir Geld, we need more cobblestone.

296
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:58,823
Got it.

297
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:00,651
I'll contact the people
at the quarry later.

298
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:01,557
Thank you.

299
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:03,377
That is...?

300
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:12,109
So today's the day of your departure
to the Dwarf kingdom?

301
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,041
Yeah.

302
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:16,534
You guys fixed the road,
so it's been a nice ride for us.

303
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,338
Thank you.

304
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,635
We worked on the road from
the Dwarf kingdom area.

305
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,737
So everything from here on
is a completed street.

306
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:26,706
Looks like it will just gets
better for us.

307
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,182
Good job.

308
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:29,885
Thank you very much.

309
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:31,073
So.

310
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:37,471
This is...?

311
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:38,674
A beer.

312
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:40,596
Beer?!

313
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:43,096
Don't drink too much, okay?

314
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:44,096
Yes, sir!

315
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:47,838
And so, the trip went smoothly.

316
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,401
Four days after the departure.

317
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,853
We arrived in the Armed Nation of Dwargon.

318
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,932
Open the gate!

319
00:18:55,957 --> 00:19:00,158
They've got such imposing demon beasts,
are they someone important?

320
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,784
Are those even a demon beasts?
I've never seen it.

321
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:05,172
Their carriages seem to be made
with unique technology.

322
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:07,569
Hey, Brother.

323
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,327
Looks like you're doing well.

324
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:11,589
Kaido!

325
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:13,597
Long time no see!
How are you doing?

326
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:16,378
I'm having fun working for Mister Rimuru.

327
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:17,589
I bet so.

328
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,448
I can tell just by looking.

329
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:21,276
How about you guys?

330
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,819
Thanks to you.

331
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:23,663
Yeah.

332
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:25,600
So.

333
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,585
Where's Mr.Rimuru?

334
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:32,202
He's the state guest, after all.

335
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:34,561
I better greet him first.

336
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,686
What is he talking about?
I'm here...

337
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:39,671
Ah, I see.

338
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:42,132
He only knew me in my slime form.

339
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:44,938
This is him.

340
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:48,110
This is him.

341
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:50,297
Him.

342
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,561
Well, a lot happened.

343
00:19:56,616 --> 00:20:00,483
Mr.Rimuru... I'm glad that
you're doing well...

344
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:03,546
Ermm... well, please, over here.

345
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,850
Well, that's to be expected.

346
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,108
And so, we safely get into Dwargon

347
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:15,210
and are now heading to meet King Gazel.

348
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,429
I'm glad that you're doing well,
Mr.Rimuru.

349
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:22,882
Same goes to you, Mr.Dorf.

350
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,655
You can drop the formalities with me.

351
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:27,835
Well then.

352
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,702
Our king is waiting for you.

353
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:34,751
He's Dorf, the Leader of the Pegasus Knights
who assisted us during the fight with Charybdis.

354
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:38,000
Pegasus Knights are the king's
top-secret unit,

355
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:41,242
so he usually disguises himself
as a civil servant like this.

356
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:50,741
The ruler of Jura Tempest Federation,
Rimuru Majesty has arrived!

357
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,999
Please, come in.

358
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:10,460
The king of the Armed Nation of Dwargon,
Gazel Dwargon.

359
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,061
Long time no see, Rimuru.

360
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,177
I see.

361
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,806
Thanks for the work.

362
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:32,434
It was a very intriguing report.

363
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:33,880
Thank you.

364
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:39,941
I don't mind returning your
heart at this point.

365
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:47,567
But it would be great if you could do
one more work for us.

366
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,989
What do you need me to do?

367
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,216
Great Clayman.

368
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,654
It's nothing big.

369
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:58,779
It's a very simple thing, in fact.

370
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:01,489
Mjurran.

371
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:16,353
I'm used to losing things

372
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:21,024
I said it like it's someone else's problem

373
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:24,903
It's a blurry realism

374
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:29,950
Because it's not about me

375
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,038
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

376
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,209
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

377
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:43,463
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

378
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:48,009
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

379
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:55,642
If I were to live for someone's sake

380
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:59,938
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

381
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:04,276
If I can redo this world once again

382
00:23:04,276 --> 00:23:09,656
I will paint that story with love

383
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:13,910
You'll know how this story's gonna end

384
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,829
I will tell you

385
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,206
I will tell you one more story

386
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:22,502
You'll know how this story's gonna end

387
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,713
I will tell you

388
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:39,352
Next time,
"Heaven, Once Again."
