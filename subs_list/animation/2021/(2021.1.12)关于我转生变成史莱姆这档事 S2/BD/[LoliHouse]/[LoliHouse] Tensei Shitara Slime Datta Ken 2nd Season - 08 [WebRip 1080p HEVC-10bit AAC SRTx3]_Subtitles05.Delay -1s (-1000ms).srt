1
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:06,968
Demon Lord Clayman is known
as the "Marionette Master."

2
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:09,132
He rules over his subordinate like puppets.

3
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,578
That includes me.

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:16,211
My duty was to investigate Tempest.

5
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,969
I used Youm to infiltrate this town.

6
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:25,508
And under Clayman's order, I cast
that great magic, Anti-Magic Area.

7
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:32,671
My heart was stolen by Clayman
using his secret spell, Marionette Heart.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,680
Ever since, I have no choice
but to follow his order.

9
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:39,570
I see.

10
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:42,953
So he literally has the power
over your life and death.

11
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:47,248
So why would Clayman
meddle with our country?

12
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:50,006
He once told me...

13
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:52,583
"This finally gets interesting."

14
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:58,017
"There were some unexpected things,
but a great war will begin"

15
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:04,724
At first, I thought it's about
Demon Lord Milim's attack on Carrion.

16
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:11,411
But seems like he's referring to
the war between Falmuth and Tempest.

17
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:13,881
Clayman...

18
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:18,092
He manipulates his subordinates as
he likes and avoids getting his hand dirty.

19
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,021
What a nasty guy.

20
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:23,295
From the looks of it, she's a Wizard.

21
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:27,084
But in this Anti-Magic Area,
she's as weak as a regular person.

22
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:28,321
That means he tossed her away.

23
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,623
Mister, please forgive her!

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,248
I beg you too!

25
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:36,646
She had no choice but to
follow what Clayman told her to!

26
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:44,513
I will think about Mjurran's
treatment later.

27
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:47,373
Until then, I will have you
under arrest in this Guest House.

28
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:48,701
Understood.

29
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,459
We will assign a guard to watch her.

30
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:51,584
Mister...

31
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,732
Sorry, Youm.
My mind's still not clear now.

32
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,740
If you're worried, I don't
mind you accompanying her.

33
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,546
Would that be all for now?

34
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:09,339
Yes.

35
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:12,607
Then let's pay the wounded a visit.
Show me the way.

36
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,385
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:33,272
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

38
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:38,277
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

39
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:43,032
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

40
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:45,951
Then it's not as fragile anymore

41
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:52,416
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

42
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,461
Beyond the page of the chapter

43
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:58,172
It's welcoming you with a smile

44
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:02,593
Whenever, as much as it takes

45
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:05,596
Let's start a new world

46
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:09,391
We're Storyteller

47
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:13,521
All the love, hope, envy

48
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:15,439
Even the song of despair we sing today

49
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,485
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

50
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:25,491
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

51
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:30,788
That's just sad

52
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:37,628
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

53
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:44,385
My real self, is now reborn!

54
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:50,021
(Episode 32: Hope)

55
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:56,779
How's everyone?

56
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,381
Great Rimuru!

57
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,263
The potion won't work.

58
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,763
The effect got blocked by
a Space element skill.

59
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:08,124
Even if I heal them, the effect
won't reach their injury.

60
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,209
I see.

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,146
Great Rimuru...

62
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,115
Please don't worry about us.

63
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:21,834
Neither I nor my incompetent disciple
is weak enough to die from this.

64
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,928
I'm not worried in the slightest.

65
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:27,435
Come on, show me your wound.

66
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:30,092
Great Sage.

67
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:33,303
The effects of the Space element
have been confirmed.

68
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,744
Use Gluttony to eat its effect?

69
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:36,940
Yes, of course.

70
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:43,877
Eh?

71
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:45,478
I'm saved?

72
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,013
Amazing, Great Rimuru.

73
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:49,560
Thank goodness!

74
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:51,615
Great Rimuru, welcome back!

75
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,154
H-Hey, Gobta!

76
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,717
Oh! You're fine, too, Geezer?

77
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,810
Do you want to sleep once again?

78
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:02,845
M-Master! I'm glad you're all fine!

79
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,014
That's why, please wait!

80
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,092
Ah, by the way, where's Shion?

81
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,685
She didn't go off on her own
for revenge, didn't she?

82
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,959
Actually, she might really do that, huh?

83
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,060
W-Well...

84
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,662
Great Rimuru...

85
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:34,584
Benimaru only said one thing.

86
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:36,920
"Please follow me."

87
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:41,623
And headed towards the plaza
where the dead bodies were enshrined.

88
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:56,810
...Gobzo?

89
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:58,045
Gobzo!

90
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:19,529
Shion protected a child who
was targeted by the attacker.

91
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:24,318
But she wasn't able to move as
she wanted because of the barrier.

92
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:29,170
Gobzo protected me.

93
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,102
The attacker just laughed at him,
and then...

94
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:43,935
Great Rimuru!

95
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:50,912
My bad.

96
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,748
Can you guys leave me
alone for a while?

97
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,099
Understood.

98
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,634
Come on.

99
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:24,570
Please call us anytime.

100
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,155
We will come right away.

101
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,205
Warning.

102
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:38,498
Powerful aura will put weakened
monsters under pressure.

103
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,710
Yeah...

104
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,300
I see.

105
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,310
I gave the Anti-Magic mask to Chloe.

106
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:50,857
Is the analysis done?

107
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:52,060
Complete.

108
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:53,891
Do you want to duplicate it?

109
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,767
Yes.

110
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,795
How did this happen?

111
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,974
Report. Incalculable.

112
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:09,323
Just what were we supposed to do?

113
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,584
Report. Unintelligible.

114
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:14,748
Was it a mistake to make contact
with human?

115
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:17,240
Report. Unanswerable.

116
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:21,193
Tell me. What did I do wrong?

117
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,607
Report. Incalculable.

118
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:24,849
Unintelligible.

119
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,465
Unanswerable.

120
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:31,887
My head is filled with strong emotion.

121
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,912
But at the same time, I'm extremely calm.

122
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,982
Not a single tears comes out.

123
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,888
Ah, I see...

124
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:45,537
My heart is already that of a monster.

125
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,523
Report.

126
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,752
No results found.

127
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:06,756
Failed to find any magic related
to a complete resurrection of the dead.

128
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:08,382
I see.

129
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,678
What about the barrier?

130
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,637
Report.

131
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:17,475
The analysis of the two barriers
covering the town is complete.

132
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,513
Removing the compound barrier is difficult.

133
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:23,771
But the Great Magic, Anti-Magic Area
can be removed.

134
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,443
Execute?

135
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,498
No. Not yet.

136
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,740
What I really want to remove
is this compound barrier.

137
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,958
But it sure has troublesome property.

138
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,750
I can't let them be like this forever.

139
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,818
Their dead bodies will eventually rot,
be reduced into magicule, and disappear.

140
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,490
At the very least, I can have them
sleep peacefully within me.

141
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:06,545
Rimuru!

142
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,945
So you came?

143
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,446
Please wait for a moment.

144
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:15,013
I need to put everyone to sleep now.

145
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,118
A-Actually!

146
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,619
The chances are slim.

147
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,372
Actually, there might not
even be a chance.

148
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:25,232
But there is a fairy tale about
resurrecting someone from the dead!

149
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,584
Fairy tell?

150
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:30,297
What the heck is that?

151
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,310
Why are you telling me that?

152
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:34,301
Stop it.

153
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,435
Don't give me hope.

154
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:41,392
You're telling me there is
more I can do for them?

155
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,662
For them?

156
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:45,904
No... that's not it.

157
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,959
I just don't want to lose them.

158
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,208
You might think it's just
some made-up stories,

159
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,490
but this one is based on real fact...

160
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,545
Rimuru?

161
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:01,615
Sorry for startling you.

162
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,154
I'm just happy.

163
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,166
Resurrection, huh.

164
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,303
It does sound like a fairy tale.

165
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,950
If the chance is not at zero,
it's worth a try.

166
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,843
Tell me more about it.

167
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:16,927
Eren.

168
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:25,122
The Western Holy Church groups
are camping near the town.

169
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:28,678
Each group is protecting
what looks like a magic device.

170
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:32,756
Looks like those devices are
what created the barrier.

171
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,748
Can you neutralize them?

172
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:36,739
I can take down at least one group.

173
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,241
Got it. You don't have to force yourself.

174
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,702
Just keep a watch on the surrounding area.

175
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,503
Yes.

176
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,663
Kept you waiting, Eren.

177
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:48,209
Tell me more about that
resurrection fairy tale.

178
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,126
Okay.

179
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,301
It's fine.

180
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,529
This is a fairy tale passed down in
the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

181
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,513
A story about a certain
girl and a dragon.

182
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:14,154
Her parents were a dragon and a human,
and she was raised as a Dragon Princess.

183
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:18,444
One day, her dragon father made
a small copy of himself

184
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:23,022
and gave it to his daughter to be her friend.

185
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,185
However...

186
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:31,043
The small dragon was killed by a king
who wanted to take over the Dragon Princess.

187
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:36,715
The girl grieved, mourned, and raged.

188
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,474
With the power she inherited from her father,

189
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:46,576
she killed the king, several hundred thousand
of his people, and finally his whole country.

190
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:50,982
After that, the girl evolved
into a Demon Lord,

191
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:55,482
and following that, the small dragon
was miraculously resurrected.

192
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,388
But...

193
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:02,032
The small dragon had already lost
its soul after its death.

194
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:06,495
It is now nothing but an evil monster
who would destroy everything on its path.

195
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,849
A Chaos Dragon.

196
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:15,498
The girl once again mourns, and seals
the dragon who was once her friend.

197
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:21,443
This tale was the start of the Dragon
Princess who now became a Demon Lord.

198
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:25,678
The story ends here.

199
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:31,795
She destroyed an entire country
and evolved into a Demon Lord.

200
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,333
Following that, the small dragon she
bonded with got resurrected.

201
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,873
It's true that monsters just
evolve out of nowhere.

202
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,896
Just giving them a name was
a huge deal for them.

203
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:47,771
But there's no point in resurrecting
them as soulless monsters.

204
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:52,912
This town is being surrounded
by a barrier, right?

205
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:59,662
If this barrier is also keeping
the souls of the dead inside...

206
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,062
Report.

207
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:05,240
The soul of dead monsters would usually
scatter and disappears.

208
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:08,482
However, there is a chance that
the compound barrier is stopping them.

209
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,977
(Probability of the souls remaining)
The probability for that is 3.14 percent.

210
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,937
As low as value of pi...

211
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:17,191
No, it's the opposite.

212
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,506
There is over three percent chance
they can be resurrected.

213
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,497
All I have to do is to evolve
into a Demon Lord.

214
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,779
Thank you for telling me that, Eren.

215
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:30,959
But are you sure?

216
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,599
You're basically telling me
to become a Demon Lord.

217
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:35,349
And also...

218
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:40,982
The truth is, my real name
is Eryune Grimwalt.

219
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:44,951
I'm a noble from the Sorcerous
Dynasty of Thalion.

220
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:46,982
So you're actually a noble lady?

221
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,851
The two of us left our country to serve
as Lady Eren's bodyguard on her trip.

222
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,520
Really?

223
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,990
We're sorry for keeping it a secret.

224
00:14:56,015 --> 00:15:00,084
I always looked up to adventurers who
look so free, so I left my country.

225
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:05,717
But only a select few in Thalion
knows about that story I told you.

226
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:10,740
If you become a Demon Lord, people will
eventually finds out that I'm involved.

227
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,693
But that's okay!

228
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:15,374
I also want to save everyone
in this town.

229
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:20,379
I also can't accept what Falmuth and
Western Holy Church did here.

230
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,771
If that's what Lady Eryune wants,
as her bodyguards, I have no objection.

231
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,084
Me neither.

232
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:27,865
You have good comrades.

233
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:29,044
Makes me jealous.

234
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:31,879
Yeah.

235
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:35,678
If you need something from us,
just let us know.

236
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:37,904
You have done so much for us, after all.

237
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,607
This time it's our turn to help you.

238
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,951
Thank you.

239
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,952
To keep the monsters' soul
from dissipating,

240
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,163
I then put on the third barrier.

241
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,631
Just in case something were to happen.

242
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,171
Demon Lord, huh...

243
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,087
Report.

244
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:07,170
The individual Rimuru Tempest
has already obtained a Demon Lord Seed.

245
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:10,262
A Demon Lord Seed? What's that?

246
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,305
Answer.

247
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:15,609
The Demon Lord Seed refers to whether one
has the qualification to evolve into a Demon Lord

248
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,859
based on their magicule and possessed skills.

249
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:22,149
It was obtained from consuming
the Orc Disaster.

250
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,920
By fulfilling the requirement, you can
evolve into a "True Demon Lord."

251
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:26,987
Really?

252
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,037
So what's the requirement?

253
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,325
Guessing from the fairy tale,

254
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,536
nutrients are needed to germinate the seed.
(Germinate Seed) (Nutrients)

255
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,955
The nutrients would be a human's soul.

256
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,791
Over ten thousand worth of it is needed.

257
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,396
I see.

258
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Great Rimuru.

259
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,085
What is it?

260
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:50,334
I just received a report from
the far recon.

261
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:56,131
The allied force of Falmuth and Western
Holy Church is heading towards Tempest.

262
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,894
Approximately twenty thousands of them.

263
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,814
Perfect timing.

264
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,123
Perfect... timing?

265
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,560
No, it's not a big deal.

266
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:08,237
Thank you for the report.

267
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,321
It's nothing.

268
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,280
Excuse me.

269
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:12,724
Well then.

270
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,115
Mjurran.

271
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,755
I've decided on your punishment.

272
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:20,506
I will have you dead.

273
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,826
Mister!

274
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,678
Please wait! Mjurran is just--

275
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,963
Grucius!

276
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:29,545
What are you doing, Youm?
Take Mjurran with you and get outta here!

277
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,888
Mjurran, let's go! Hurry--

278
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,396
I loved you, Youm.

279
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:41,701
You're the first man I've fallen
for in all my life.

280
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:45,842
Don't fall by a bad woman
again next time, okay?

281
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:48,735
Goodbye.

282
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,695
Mjurran!

283
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,146
Mjurran!

284
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,029
Mister! I beg you! Stop it!

285
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:58,653
I will amend for her! I will do anything!

286
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,717
Good determination.

287
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,982
I will make up for it for
my whole life!

288
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:06,185
No way! No! Mjurran!

289
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:23,020
Okay, looks like it went well.

290
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,396
Eh? Why am I still alive?

291
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:29,154
I think you're dead for
about three seconds.

292
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,428
Well, I did say I will have you dead,
but I have no intention to kill you.

293
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,523
Report.

294
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:39,411
The individual Mjurran's pseudo-heart
successfully operates normally.

295
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,773
(Operates normally)
Great.

296
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:44,255
I learned about this
when I put on the third barrier.

297
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:49,796
Clayman is using the temporary heart he
put on Mjurran to wiretap her surrounding.

298
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,860
Wiretap?

299
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:56,070
This emits encrypted electronic signal
and delivers it to Clayman.

300
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:59,765
So to deceive him, I need to make
it looks like I just killed Mjurran.

301
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,038
I'm sorry for making
you guys go through this.

302
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,143
It's fine.

303
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,729
Then... what's this beat on my chest?

304
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:09,399
It's an artificial heart I made
based on your temporary heart.

305
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,429
And of course, there's no wiretap in it.

306
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,278
Now you're free.

307
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,031
Clayman can't do anything to you now.

308
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:19,868
Isn't that great, Mjurran?

309
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,562
There's nothing that binds you anymore!

310
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,937
Rimuru...

311
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,593
No, Great Rimuru.

312
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:31,710
No words can I use to express
my gratitude to you.

313
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:36,051
If you wish for my loyalty,
then I will gladly give it to you.

314
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,710
No, you don't have to.

315
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:41,359
But I want you to help me with something.

316
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,648
What would that be?

317
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,442
Just like how you just died and
back alive,

318
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,763
there's a chance we can resurrect
Shion and others.

319
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,523
...Can it be done?

320
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:54,046
It's still a matter of chance.

321
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:57,601
And I want to do everything I can
to boost that chance.

322
00:19:58,413 --> 00:19:59,835
Will you help me?

323
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,046
Understood.

324
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,663
I will do my best to help.

325
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:05,562
Thank you.

326
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:09,601
So what do you plan to do
after we're done with that?

327
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:15,155
I finally get my freedom back.

328
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:20,835
But I don't mind being confined
for a short human lifespan.

329
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,888
Eh?

330
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,187
Does that mean...

331
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:28,228
I don't need your pity!

332
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:32,945
Besides, Youm's human. So he'll
live for like a hundred years or so.

333
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:35,101
After that is my turn.

334
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,351
What did you just said?!

335
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,734
You're really thinking about that,
you shitty werewolf?!

336
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,741
Hah? What did you just say,
you shitty human?!

337
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,826
- You hear me, I said "shitty werewolf"!
- By the way, Youm.

338
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,163
- You hear me, I said "shitty werewolf"!
- I've got a favor to ask of you.

339
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:46,249
Ah, yes.

340
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,093
I will do anything for you.

341
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:50,843
Be the next king of Falmuth for me.

342
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,953
Oh yeah, just leave it to me!

343
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,380
Eh?

344
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,423
King?

345
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:03,889
So we will kill the Falmuth army along with
their king who is heading this way.

346
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:07,225
But of course, that would put
their people in a bind, right?

347
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,242
That's where you come in.

348
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:14,483
I want you to govern Falmuth as their
new king and form a relation with us.

349
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,443
You made it sounds easy.

350
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,986
But me? A king?

351
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,237
It's fine.

352
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,365
I will be a Demon Lord after this,
so you might as well join me.

353
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,716
Great Rimuru is asking you
because he trusts you.

354
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:29,515
I will help you too, so why
not try to live an eventful life?

355
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,460
Count me in, too.

356
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,601
I will be by your side
waiting for the time you die.

357
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:36,626
What?!

358
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,918
Got it. I will do it.

359
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:42,082
Just leave it to me.

360
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:42,907
Great!

361
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,524
Sorry for keeping you all waiting.

362
00:21:54,157 --> 00:21:56,142
The meeting now starts.

363
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:00,478
Our topic for today is about our
approach towards humans from now on...

364
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,282
...and resurrection of Shion and others!

365
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,503
I'm used to losing things

366
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

367
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,053
It's a blurry realism

368
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:30,100
Because it's not about me

369
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

370
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:39,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

371
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

372
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:48,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

373
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

374
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

375
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,426
If I can redo this world once again

376
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:09,806
I will paint that story with love

377
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

378
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,979
I will tell you

379
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,356
I will tell you one more story

380
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

381
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,863
I will tell you

382
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,252
Next time, "With Everything."
