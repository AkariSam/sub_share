1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:10,041
800 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,907
No!

3
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,832
Grandpa, help!

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,031
Stop crying.

5
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:37,740
The demons are gone.

6
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,073
No, Grandpa.

7
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,948
I feel sad because I need grandpa's protection all the time,

8
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:47,125
and I am useless to this world.

9
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,865
That's not a big deal at all.

10
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,240
While you're under protection, accumulate your experience.

11
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,073
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

12
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,906
But don't forget.

13
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,615
After we are gone,

14
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,156
it's your job to protect

15
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:08,167
the new Idatens.

16
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,581
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

17
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,992
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

18
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,657
Well,

19
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:58,073
that's about how strong they are.

20
00:02:58,082 --> 00:02:59,282
What do you think?

21
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:01,115
I'd like to say they're weak,

22
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:06,240
but they seem to be more difficult
to deal with than I thought.

23
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,282
Really, sister Piscalat?

24
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:11,823
I think even I can take them down.

25
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:15,198
Kori, don't bring the fish into the conference room.

26
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,604
But I agree with you.

27
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,240
We're not supposed
to be afraid of such crap

28
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,457
and live in a humble way like human.

29
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,282
It's stupid.

30
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's just destroy the world.

31
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,948
Nepto, be quiet, please.

32
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:31,542
Or I'll kill you.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,250
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,865
I totally understand.

35
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,740
But let's make something clear.

36
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,582
First, put your hands up
if you think you can beat these two.

37
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:48,282
Almost everyone.

38
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:52,000
What about this kid?

39
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:55,698
What if

40
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:59,698
there are a lot of Idatens as strong as this kid?

41
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:04,042
What if there's a master twice as strong as him?

42
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,865
Nickel and Brandy.

43
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,740
Looks like you're the only ones left.

44
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,073
Umeyo, Miku, Bacode.

45
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:19,240
What's the population of humans and demons now?

46
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,990
There are 364 of us.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,365
There are 80 million human soldiers.

48
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,572
The total human population is 220 million.

49
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,197
The human population grows steadily.

50
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,031
You can have as much work force as you want.

51
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,156
The problem is the population of demons.

52
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,615
Only 364 more people in 100 years is not enough.

53
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,146
You're still young.

54
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,906
You may have a few more kids to grow our number.

55
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,281
It's more than that.

56
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,615
We have to stop living in the shadows,

57
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:56,156
because they are aware of our existence now.

58
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,572
Then we must attack soon.

59
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,947
Right.

60
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,615
Actually, the other day when I blew myself up,

61
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,740
I set up a transmitter on this kid.

62
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,990
Transmitter?

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,156
Yeah.

64
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,627
When Hayato was back from chasing that doctor,

65
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:12,656
he's got a transmitter stuck to him.

66
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,615
But I don't know if it's because of the impact,

67
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,572
it's not functioning right.

68
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,490
It stays at the same spot the whole week.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,822
And the source of the signal disappeared a few days ago.

70
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,281
I disabled the transmitter's bugging function,

71
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,365
and stuck it to Rin.

72
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,531
But it was gone a few days ago.

73
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,865
I think they might have noticed.

74
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,281
They might send assassins immediately.

75
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,447
We don't know how many of them there are,

76
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:46,156
so we have to send our best cards.

77
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,906
I guess the assassin they sent over

78
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,750
must be stronger than Hayato.

79
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,156
Rin has never left the seal,

80
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,697
so they must bring the fight to her.

81
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,531
Isli, Paula.

82
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,447
Let the training begin.

83
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,791
Yes.

84
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,072
Let's go.

85
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,365
Hey, Isli, wait.

86
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,156
Are you going to leave the enemies to Rin?

87
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,365
What if she loses the battle?

88
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,490
You've been here a week.

89
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,447
Do you think she can be easily defeated?

90
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,406
I don't think so.

91
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,615
But...

92
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,490
And, Paula,

93
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,115
If Rin is defeated,

94
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,865
we have no chance of winning at all.

95
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,531
Then it's going to be you,

96
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,572
- Nickel. - Okay.

97
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,875
Old woman...

98
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,375
From the ground?

99
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,916
Too naive, Hayato.

100
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,697
Paula.

101
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,541
Old woman, I'm here.

102
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,791
How about that, old woman?

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,875
I haven't been hit for 200 years.

104
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,197
Your turn, Isli.

105
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,958
Are you running out of your clever tricks?

106
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,656
Darn it.

107
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,531
She's unharmed even if I didn't miss the target.

108
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,250
I didn't stand a chance of winning from the start.

109
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,291
Okay, I'm going.

110
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,791
What's going on?

111
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,333
Only four of you?

112
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,490
What is that thing?

113
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,072
- Human? - She ran away.

114
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,115
But it feels like

115
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,697
a huge demon covered in human skin.

116
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,197
Hey, who are you?

117
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,990
Judging by your outfit, are you the old man's companion?

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,500
What is a human doing here?

119
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,166
- One down. - You...

120
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,750
How could you suddenly attack my stomach?

121
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:34,917
That's weird.

122
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,782
Right,

123
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,907
you won't die from such injury.

124
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,990
Then let's do some experiment to see

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,707
what kind of injury is deadly to you.

126
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't underestimate me.

127
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,322
Let's see.

128
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,292
I wonder what kind of torture is deadly to you?

129
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Are you going to die now?

130
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:20,407
There came a strange human.

131
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:23,375
From now on, let me be your rival.

132
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,750
I see. You are their leader.

133
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,447
Wait, old woman.

134
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:35,822
Stay out of this.

135
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:37,207
He is my rival...

136
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,615
Isli,

137
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,740
take Hayato and Paula away from here.

138
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,750
Okay.

139
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,667
You look miserable.

140
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,322
Rin, be careful.

141
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:53,197
He is not a human,

142
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:54,322
but a demon.

143
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:55,457
What did you say?

144
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,167
Don't look around.

145
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,990
Your hands stretch so long.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,375
Is it because you don't want to take my attack?

147
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:21,115
So fast.

148
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,782
Since I can't attack from afar,

149
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,792
I will...

150
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,115
Disgusting.

151
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,207
Take this!

152
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:54,792
Enough!

153
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,615
But your hands are wasted.

154
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,542
What can you do with your feet only...

155
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,907
What?

156
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,832
Why did she recover?

157
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,657
It's unbelievable.

158
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,657
He is almost as good as Rin.

159
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,240
Isli, why are we staying here?

160
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,490
Let's escape to somewhere farther.

161
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,907
No,

162
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,197
we are within Rin's sphere of influence.

163
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,082
If we go any further, we will be in danger.

164
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,782
That boy with glasses is smart.

165
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,532
If shooting from here makes the ground collapse,

166
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,572
they will manage to escape.

167
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:56,250
And there is someone who can confront Nickel head-on.

168
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,990
Even if I pierce through her throat, it's not a fatal blow.

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,240
This is thorny.

170
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,917
I can understand why Piscalat said it was difficult.

171
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,792
Wait a minute. Let me ask you a question.

172
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,667
What are you?

173
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:45,032
I don't know why you ask me this.

174
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,782
I am a demon.

175
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,115
Do you really think I'm a human?

176
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,292
Well, you look like one.

177
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:56,365
I saw a lot of demons 800 years ago.

178
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,240
Among so many of them,

179
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,615
no one can speak human language or have intelligence,

180
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,832
or have the same look as you.

181
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,653
Does it mean almost all the demons

182
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:13,490
are like that monster without intelligence?

183
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,125
That is to say, it is the doctor...

184
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,532
Someone has given us human appearance and intelligence.

185
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,490
You should have heard of it, too.

186
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,240
The name of the Demon Lord

187
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,990
is Demon King Over M.

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,365
I knew it.

189
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,615
He's Oobami, so he calls himself Demon King Over M?

190
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,865
He uses the abbreviation
and it becomes the Demon Lord's name.

191
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,532
So lame.

192
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,740
When did you set up the bug?

193
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,740
Just now.

194
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,197
And I think I know the real identity of the Doctor.

195
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,207
He's probably a human.

196
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,740
Demon Lord?

197
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,532
He just planted certain memories in them

198
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:54,032
to keep the whole demon tribe under his control.

199
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,532
Rin's following reaction is the evidence.

200
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,072
Who is it?

201
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:01,042
Never heard of it before.

202
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:08,032
Whatever. I don't know the details.

203
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,207
You are not a human anyway.

204
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:14,240
Since you are a demon,

205
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,157
I'll try my best to wipe you out.

206
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:19,032
She got a sword out of nowhere?

207
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:22,782
Too many unexpected things happened.

208
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:27,115
Swords forged by human can't hurt Nickel.

209
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,917
But the sword in her hand doesn't seem like one.

210
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,157
What's that?

211
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:33,907
Where did that sword come from?

212
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:36,322
Just like how I put on my glasses and clothes,

213
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:38,625
you can also change your clothes at will.

214
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:43,799
But if it's not a necessary battle,

215
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,957
Rin won't take out her weapon.

216
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,072
If there is a way to wipe me out, give it a try.

217
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:54,072
Sister.

218
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:58,322
But I might have a few hands cut off.

219
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:02,865
Whatever. The broken hands will be gifts for you.

220
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,625
I'll take my chance to launch maximum attack with my tail.

221
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:14,157
I don't think you would still have time to regenerate.

222
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,500
I'll cut you apart in an instant.

223
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,572
You're just like that Demon Lord.

224
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:30,667
You know nothing about us Idatens at all.

225
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:34,822
Do you really think if you send one demon here,

226
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:39,407
it'll be enough to confront a fully trained Idaten?

227
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,865
I've never seen one demon defeated Idaten on his own.

228
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,365
What?

229
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,697
I can't move my body.

230
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:48,947
Isli, Paula.

231
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:51,417
You can come back now.

232
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,157
This is

233
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,822
a binding spell or a sealing spell?

234
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,865
Binding spell.

235
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,822
I remember my grandpa used it.

236
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,365
But I can't.

237
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,532
Is this some kind of joke?

238
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,782
What on earth did you do?

239
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,240
Why can't I move?

240
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,667
Of course you can't move.

241
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,167
Because your head is separated from your body.

242
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:28,740
800 years ago,

243
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,947
the threat posed by the demon tribe is gone,

244
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,365
and it's been a long period of peace.

245
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,947
During those stable years,

246
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:37,947
Rin is the only Idaten survivor.

247
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:43,240
However, Rin was swallowed up by great "fear" inside her.

248
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,615
It's scary.

249
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,532
Why? What am I afraid of?

250
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,490
Grandpa's seal is perfect,

251
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,657
and demons will never show up again.

252
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,322
But what if the seal is undone?

253
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,962
What if there are still surviving demons?

254
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:58,490
Grandpa and everyone are gone.

255
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,365
No one can protect me.

256
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,125
Now, it's just me.

257
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:05,500
And I can't do anything about it.

258
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,198
And for quite a long period of time

259
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,666
Rin had been frantically escaping from her fear.

260
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,323
Through the years,

261
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,490
after confirming that there were no demons left,

262
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,073
Rin started taking real actions.

263
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,791
And that was 50 years after the demons are sealed.

264
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,833
Rin finally started to pursue strength,

265
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,906
and that is, absolutely invincible battle power.

266
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,865
She was not sure how strong she's got to be.

267
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,800
It was just to resolve the restlessness in her heart.

268
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:47,781
During these 350 years, she kept training herself brutally.

269
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,323
But the fear in her heart wasn't really gone until

270
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,000
200 years later.

271
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,198
That's when the first Idaten in the peaceful era,

272
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,406
Prontea, finished her training.

273
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,865
It was on this day that she felt
the peaceful time had finally come.

274
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,666
She smiled again for the first time in 600 years.

275
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,115
What?

276
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,656
How's that possible?

277
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,531
What happened, Gizati?

278
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,073
How is it going?

279
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,156
Is Nickel defeated?

280
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,073
Piscalat,

281
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,990
it is not as simple as you thought.

282
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,198
Nickel was killed in an instant.

283
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,250
Now we have no chance of winning.

284
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,125
Do you think I didn't notice?

285
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,781
Wait.

286
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,406
What should we do now?

287
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,573
Brandy,

288
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,948
you are next?

289
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,281
Nickel was killed in an instant.

290
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,990
How can I possibly win?

291
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,948
You always say you are stronger than Nickel.

292
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,990
It's true, but...

293
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,125
- We'll have to tell the Demon Lord the truth.
- I was just bluffing.

294
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,323
I guess

295
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,323
this guy should be the strongest among the demon tribe.

296
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,000
That is to say,

297
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,791
Rin is invincible now.

298
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,583
You're awake, Hayato.

299
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,781
Even if demons are so strong,
they still can't conquer the world.

300
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:28,323
It seems the Zobul Empire is weaker than it looks.

301
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,791
I see. Just like me and Prontea.

302
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,250
There are only two of them.

303
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,250
But demons with intelligence...

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,031
He mentioned something else just now.

305
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,698
Demon King Over M?

306
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,458
I remember my grandpa...

307
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,781
- What's wrong with you? - Old woman.

308
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,781
Let's start training now.

309
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,291
I can't take it that I was knocked down
by someone other than you.

310
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,323
Before you fully recover, lie down, idiot.

311
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,166
Paula, where is Isli?

312
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,073
Right, where is he?

313
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,031
Mr. Isli,

314
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,115
previous monsters have been collected

315
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,073
and sent to the lab.

316
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,906
Samples are now under detailed investigation.

317
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,031
Really?

318
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,198
Thank you.

319
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,240
Please carry on the investigation.

320
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,990
I will send new samples later.

321
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,281
- The doctor said the cost of the research...
- There will be no limits.

322
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,281
He can spend tens of billions.

323
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,115
Just buy any research equipment he needs.

324
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,990
But he must come up with some results.

325
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,375
Next is...

326
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,073
- Hello. - Prontea.

327
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,781
Isli, I haven't heard from you for a long time.

328
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,240
What's up? How's Paula?

329
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,823
Is nature still the only thing she's interested in?

330
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:05,406
By the way, the Idaten theory you deduced is really amazing.

331
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,031
I can really use magic-like skills.

332
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,281
You are remarkable, Prontea.

333
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,365
I will visit you soon.

334
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,500
Maybe today.

335
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,156
Nickel was killed in an instant.

336
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,416
What should we do now?
