1
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:11,624
How are the escaped demons doing?

2
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:15,285
I'm sorry but we haven't spotted anything.

3
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:18,487
Really? But two years have passed since then.

4
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:21,112
They should have planned something.

5
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,278
I have a question.

6
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:25,506
If you didn't fuse with humans,

7
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:26,821
what kind of demons would you be?

8
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:33,265
We would be giant monsters with tentacles all over

9
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:35,481
and without a set form.

10
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:38,904
What about Kori? He's got a lot of eyes.

11
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,487
We all have more than one pair of eyes.

12
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:46,070
But after we fuse with humans, those eyes
are hidden inside our bodies.

13
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:47,737
Excuse me.

14
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:51,539
I have an eye that can see things in my mouth,

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,539
but it's useless.

16
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:59,362
Excuse me, Mr. Isli.

17
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:03,520
It has a thin eyelid just like frogs'.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,594
Could you open your mouth wider?

19
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,570
I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,885
No, Bacode. It's not what you're thinking.

21
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:13,135
Sorry, I was too focused.

22
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:13,918
What is it?

23
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:16,112
Well...

24
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:21,362
So, you can't control your baby

25
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,737
and you need our help?

26
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:28,034
I see. Is this the plan he was talking about?

27
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:32,412
Pisara, please save our kid.

28
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:34,665
How old is he?

29
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:36,879
About two months.

30
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:38,962
Then you have to give it up.

31
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:43,090
Demons older than two weeks can no long fuse with humans.

32
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:48,195
A lot of demons who failed to fuse have been punished.

33
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,846
Don't you know that?

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,528
How come...

35
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,153
Hey, Buzz.

36
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:55,519
Do you know any other demons on the run?

37
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,465
Just as I told you,

38
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:00,275
we didn't tell anyone that we would run away.

39
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,609
Something feels wrong.

40
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:05,405
Melianor, you don't know where they are either?

41
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:07,862
No, I don't.

42
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,070
I've been with Buzz all the time.

43
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,830
Pisara already has doubt about what I said.

44
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:17,112
Should I run away with Melianor?

45
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:22,487
If that's the case... you're useless.

46
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,028
Melianor...

47
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,528
Fish tastes much better than that.

48
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,403
Bastard!

49
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,362
You've become stronger.

50
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:41,106
Is he stronger than Nickel, Kori?

51
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,346
Who cares?

52
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:47,237
If Nickel is still alive, I want to fight it out with him.

53
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:52,534
So they cut off all the connections
and escaped to a deserted island?

54
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:55,862
That would not be a right way to go.

55
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,466
Escaping while avoiding all the risks,

56
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:01,120
including ways to collect the enemy's information,

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,028
is like living a life doing nothing for fear of failure.

58
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:06,320
The only result will be...

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,258
FAILURE

60
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,825
failure and nothing else.

61
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:23,316
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

62
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,976
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

63
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:47,942
Episode 10 Demons

64
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:10,737
Gil, are you alright?

65
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:13,528
Yes, I can still take more...

66
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:17,471
Your waist is twisted. I guess that's all for today.

67
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:20,682
What a drag. You guys can't stand up already?

68
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,446
And the old hag shows no motivation, either.

69
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,326
Prontea doesn't show up often.

70
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,725
Looks like you're bored, brother Hayato.

71
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,112
I'll be your opponent.

72
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,156
Who are you?

73
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,115
DISAPPOINTED

74
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,028
He changed a little, but he looks like Kori.

75
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,487
Oh, Kori.

76
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:44,821
Be more serious with me.

77
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,196
Let's do it then.

78
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:48,752
Kori... who?

79
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,665
Brother Isli taught me

80
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:55,778
how to use my strength in a right way.

81
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,112
You mean the guy whose face can transform?

82
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,821
Bring it on however you want.

83
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:15,225
Disgusting.

84
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:35,555
Hey, why don't you go somewhere else...

85
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:46,608
Why is this guy so strong?

86
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,526
Paula is mad. Let's go somewhere else.

87
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,649
Before we leave, tell me

88
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:55,987
what kind of training you took that makes you so strong.

89
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:58,406
Training? There's no such thing.

90
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,158
I have just grown up.

91
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,886
Like a lion, the little one is much weaker

92
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:06,233
than the older one, right?

93
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,747
The same is true for me.

94
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,401
It's so unreasonable that

95
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,817
demons can be stronger when growing up.

96
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:17,151
It's also unreasonable that

97
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,927
Idatens can be stronger by trainings.

98
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:22,346
Do you think Hayato will defeat Kori?

99
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:24,672
I think so.

100
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:28,608
If I'm as strong as Hayato,

101
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,442
I can definitely win.

102
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:34,185
That body armor can actually taste things.

103
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,776
If I apply chili sauce all over me,

104
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,526
he can't fight at his best,

105
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,199
just like how I defeated Pisara.

106
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,699
Don't remind me of that, please.

107
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:50,483
But I hope Hayata can win the battle

108
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,151
without those tricks.

109
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:57,548
Compared with a fighter who has been through hard training,

110
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,968
a wild bear seems to be stronger.

111
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:05,055
Hayato got his super strength through countless training.

112
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,858
I hope he could fight like the bear.

113
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:11,978
It's time to eat.

114
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,274
Here you go.

115
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:19,151
Merku, how's everything going?

116
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:22,733
There is no aftereffect after fusion.
They're growing up well.

117
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,567
They are your future husbands.

118
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,410
You need to feed and raise them with all your heart.

119
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:29,913
I'm still struggling with that idea.

120
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:33,666
Miku, do I have to make love with these two kids?

121
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,605
Merku, turn on the TV.

122
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:36,905
TV?

123
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:43,510
Look. We have clearly shot the giant monster.

124
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:47,484
- Under its attack, the ship looks like - This is...

125
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:48,566
- Buzz's or Raqi's... - it's made of paper.

126
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,684
Whatever... it's one of their kid.

127
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:53,144
I've been waiting for this.

128
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:55,900
Once there are demons causing riots,

129
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,942
Idatens will focus on them.

130
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:02,109
I'll take the chance to meet the Demon Lord,

131
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,150
and launch all the plans.

132
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,105
Delivery.

133
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,316
Thanks.

134
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,123
A strange robot, a small camera and a digital camera.

135
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,317
Why did you buy these?

136
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,836
I'll take a picture of this robot,

137
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:18,796
and then post it on my blog.

138
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,067
(IMPULSIVE SHOPPING I BOUGHT A STRANGE ROBOT IMPULSIVELY)
Done!

139
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:20,859
What's done?

140
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,216
A radio speaker is put inside the robot,

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,900
and the robot can move its arms and legs.

142
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,485
With this small camera,

143
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:30,099
it can be Demon Lord's body for now.

144
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:31,865
Can't we use something better?

145
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,192
That'll be expensive.

146
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:36,692
But how will Demon Lord know that we posted the blog?

147
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,706
After a while, he will reach out to us.

148
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:44,321
Before escaping, I've already planned this,

149
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,033
so I wrote something in the letter to Demon Lord.

150
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,953
What? Then he can just call us.

151
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,538
That won't work.

152
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:57,734
The communication companies run by Zobul
must have been controlled.

153
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:01,505
Also, he won't know my new number after I escape.

154
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:03,859
Then what did you write in the letter?

155
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,966
A strange word.

156
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,889
(LIKE PACCHU ROGE ITS MEANING IS UNKNOWN)
Look. That's the word I put in my blog.

157
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,067
What does it mean?

158
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,192
It's meaningless. I made it up.

159
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,977
That's why it's useful now,

160
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,541
because you won't get any results
if you search for it online.

161
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:25,275
So, the first blog coming up with these words in it,

162
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:29,067
no matter how dumb, must be written by me.

163
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,166
In this way, he can reach out to us,

164
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,765
and the enemies won't find out.

165
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,580
But Miku, after he finds the blog,

166
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,900
should we tell him our address?

167
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,317
Won't it be dangerous?

168
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,109
Merku, what are you talking about?

169
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:50,275
Did you forget how I got this address?

170
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,609
The personal information here has long been exposed.

171
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,466
You can find it anywhere.

172
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:57,966
This is a great strategy, right?

173
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:02,745
She had planned all these before escaping.

174
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,192
At that moment, she had anticipated
the collapse of Zobul Empire,

175
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:07,725
the lost contact means,

176
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:11,196
the way to occupy a place in an Internet cafe,

177
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:15,326
and even a careless way for him to find us.

178
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,121
Miku.

179
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,525
How dare you run away by yourself!

180
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,192
Hi, it's faster than I expected.

181
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:23,754
Demon Lord, long time no see.

182
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,442
Screw you, dumbass.

183
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:31,010
Her long-term scheme kinda disgusts me.

184
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,931
You have searched at the right time.

185
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,812
Hi, Merku.

186
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:38,707
We've determined the time to search it long ago.

187
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:43,274
Once demons have attracted Idatens' attention,
I'll start searching.

188
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:45,666
That's even included in the scheme.

189
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,192
Actually, I started earlier than that.

190
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:51,150
It's after Buzz and Melianor were killed.

191
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:54,450
The monster on the news was their kid, right?

192
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,804
They must have come to them to save their kids.

193
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,335
So, Demon Lord, please tell me what you've known.

194
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,004
Why are you having that face?

195
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,677
Well, I just feel everything is awful.

196
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,609
Pisara and others have been brainwashed.

197
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,942
The only ones left are

198
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:19,745
Kimochi, Ferrandia, Colot and Raqi.

199
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:22,770
They're useless. Let's give up.

200
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,775
Don't say that again!

201
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:27,817
Anyway, I need a lab.

202
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,820
I can do nothing here.

203
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:32,359
I think Kimochi will prepare that for you.

204
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,616
You just need to meet with him.

205
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,534
How?

206
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:39,038
How about the same way you met with Miku?

207
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:42,625
Then we have to have the keyword in advance.

208
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:44,734
How about using a secret code?

209
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:48,339
The enemy knows compilation of Zobul's codes.

210
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,025
Miku, do you have any idea?

211
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:51,926
Yeah.

212
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:52,650
What's it?

213
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,150
He calls you regularly, right?

214
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,650
Demon Lord, what did you tell him?

215
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,317
Well, I told him the list of surviving demons,

216
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:01,859
and that Pisara and others were brainwashed,

217
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:03,817
Buzz was killed and so on.

218
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,775
Would those words help?

219
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,024
Hold on.

220
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,567
Next time he calls you, tell him this.

221
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,806
What the hell is that?

222
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,650
PEACEFUL LIFE

223
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:26,745
Who is it?

224
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,400
Please take your note now.

225
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,734
That's how we'll meet.

226
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,009
Zobul's 3B code.

227
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,192
The password is...

228
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,525
- Zobul's 3B code? - 264338373

229
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,484
- Use keywords and passwords to write an article.
- 8337389987

230
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,350
- Is it Caesar cipher? - 28368.

231
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:44,645
Why does he tell me this?

232
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:48,225
I thought they've already got the pre-determined keyword.

233
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,109
The keyword is...

234
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,265
the password of my favorite game when I was little.

235
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:00,650
It's "sososesou ochikon kosekichisau otokesoso".

236
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,828
What the hell is that?

237
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:06,265
But Idatens can't possibly figure that out.

238
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:07,739
Damn.

239
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,254
I can't believe they contact each other like that.

240
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,509
They used the keyword only they know as the code.

241
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:18,428
Others besides Miku may also figure that out.

242
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,181
This way of thinking is not special.

243
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:22,234
But...

244
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:25,775
Why does Demon Lord know the password?

245
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,524
You call that a password? The OCHIKON part

246
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:32,145
sounds like a little OO.

247
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:33,275
Does not!

248
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:36,317
Little OO... Little OO password!

249
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,197
Miku, stop it.

250
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,692
It must be Miku.

251
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,900
She remembers all the nasty details.

252
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,706
It's disgusting.

253
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,734
Here you go. I've figured out the password.

254
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:53,567
The place selling radios at the Shimau toy store
in the Djourou train station.

255
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,046
The station is so deserted.

256
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,429
DJOUROU

257
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,693
SHIMAU TOY STORE

258
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,720
Where is the radio?

259
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,379
Hi, Kimochi.

260
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,538
We finally meet.

261
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:17,125
Demon Lord, long time no see.

262
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,230
Thanks.

263
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:25,025
Demon Lord, you must have met Miku and the others.

264
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,567
Where are they?

265
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,775
They told me to not tell you.

266
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,900
We won't meet with them?

267
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
What's the point anyway?

268
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,934
It'll only give Idatens a chance to kill us all.

269
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:39,187
We also need to be careful for being brainwashed.

270
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:41,606
If one is caught, all of us will be doomed.

271
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:48,155
So, only Demon Lord needs to know where we are.

272
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,317
So, I have to do this eventually.

273
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,609
Merku, you want to do that with Kimochi?

274
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:54,202
SHOCKED

275
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,039
If you can make sure it's safe,

276
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,360
you can have coitus in the forest over there.

277
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:03,129
Coitus... I am still reluctant even if you change a word.

278
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:07,234
Although I wish it could be done before the kids grow up,

279
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,009
IT'S SO NICE TO EAT NATTO THIS WAY
I don't think it'll happen.

280
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:12,804
Miku proposed that. What do you think, Kimochi?

281
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,640
Merku and Miku will do that with me?

282
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:18,351
Hey, I can tolerate it if you have fun with female humans.

283
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,202
If you cheat on me with our kind, I'll kill you.

284
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,107
Yes, I get it.

285
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,317
Ferr is so faithful.

286
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,609
Miku, stop being an ass.

287
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:31,740
How about foursome?

288
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:34,234
We can use this to come up with something.

289
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:34,899
Leave us alone.

290
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:37,775
You haven't changed at all.

291
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:41,708
Never mind. How do you plan to meet Raqi and Colot?

292
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,421
We don't have to.

293
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:48,506
We don't need Raqi at all.

294
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,192
She's a dumbass after all.

295
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,984
A small mistake can kill us all.

296
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:54,263
So we don't need her.

297
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,067
But if we leave her alone,

298
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,025
she might be useful.

299
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,525
Got it!

300
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,442
Raqi, I'm back.

301
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,519
Your body...

302
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,233
You've lost a lot of weight when I went out to hunt.

303
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:10,904
Where is our kid?

304
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:12,656
I just delivered it.

305
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,534
And I trashed it in the sea.

306
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:18,453
Forget it. It's a monster anyway.

307
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:22,039
It's not important, Colot.

308
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,601
SEVEN YEARS LATER

309
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,276
Whale...

310
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:55,782
I haven't seen any whales nearby for a hundred years.

311
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,743
But, it has been eaten.

312
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:11,339
Where is it? Did it run away?

313
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,579
Demon. Is it?

314
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,526
Ouch...

315
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,240
I lost!

316
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:33,983
Great!

317
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:35,733
I win today, too!

318
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:41,037
Gil is gradually catching up with Hayato.

319
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:44,067
She grows at a remarkable speed.

320
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,660
Maybe it's because she absorbed a lot of

321
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,877
thoughts of human demons before being summoned.

322
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,776
That's great news.

323
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,140
But we've got a problem here.

324
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:58,721
What a drag.

325
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,890
It's the fourth.

326
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:04,643
Yeah, it's definitely the product of pure demons.

327
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,401
But, it's strange.

328
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,733
According to master and Pisara,

329
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,816
there shouldn't be so many new ones.

330
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,028
I heard it takes a long time for human demons to take shape.

331
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:18,019
If the fusion fails, it will be disposed of.

332
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:22,577
The reason why pure demons grow fast in number
should be sufficient food.

333
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:27,608
Demons used to be starved to death or eat each other.

334
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:30,901
There are all kinds of creatures now.

335
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:32,880
Food is available everywhere.

336
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,048
We can't think in the same old way.

337
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:39,135
Right. It's getting harder.

338
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:41,055
Any updates?

339
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:45,226
It's all trash information.

340
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:47,603
To be honest, I believe it may backfire.

341
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:52,316
REPORT AWARD ONE HUNDRED MILLION

342
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,943
(NATIONAL WANTED LIST MIKU UMEYO KIMOCHI FERRANDIA)
A wanted list?

343
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:01,151
What a mess. They are panicked.

344
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,483
Miku, I'm home.

345
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,983
I bought some food.

346
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,567
Tita, welcome home.

347
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,332
What's up? Are you hungry?

348
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:10,460
Or do you want to have fun first?

349
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,067
I wanna have fun now.

350
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,151
Naughty boy.

351
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:19,551
You want to have fun with me or Merku?

352
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,108
We really live a dirty life,

353
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,192
so dirty.

354
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:24,890
You don't like it?

355
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,434
I don't like myself for enjoying it.

356
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,692
She's the one on the wanted list, isn't she?

357
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,442
The wanted girl with a reward of 100 million.

358
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:40,483
Take a nice picture.

359
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,233
- Hey... - I found her.

360
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,742
- Right, in the central avenue. - What about the reward?

361
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,026
- Miku is on Central Avenue. - There are a lot of witnesses.

362
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:48,497
Turn the camera.

363
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:52,075
Look. You can get a closer picture.

364
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:54,026
Is she the real one?

365
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,108
Yes.

366
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:57,673
I can confirm that based on her appearance and voice.

367
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:00,217
But what does she want?

368
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:01,692
What a drag.

369
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:05,519
If I catch her, I'll get the reward.

370
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,940
Sorry, but you can't touch me.

371
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:19,358
- Alright, it's time for me to run away. - Run!
