1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,708
The seal that Rin has been guarding

2
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,460
has an exact model.

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,207
The size is about 1 over 800 of the original one.

4
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,625
Basically, it's a simulation model.

5
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:22,582
Prontea,

6
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:23,917
what's sealed inside?

7
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,417
Two thousand cockroaches.

8
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,832
It's the scariest seal in the world.

9
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:32,292
I don't mind those roaches.

10
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:37,542
Is it possible someone else could break the seal?

11
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:42,792
This flag is the antenna that holds the seal.

12
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,457
If the flag is destroyed,
whatever is in there is gonna come out.

13
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:48,500
I see.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,332
That's what Rin believes,
so she's been guarding the seal for 800 years.

15
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,582
But...

16
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,792
Hey, the roaches are coming out.

17
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,832
That's the truth.

18
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,957
All killed.

19
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,542
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

20
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,027
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

21
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,250
(IN FAST EXPLANATION)
The correct cause of death is starvation,

22
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,167
which is different from the suspended animation state
by keeping the temperature low.

23
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,667
It's not different from cockroaches
being stuck in roach traps.

24
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,542
After being trapped inside for a few days, they'll die.

25
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,707
So do the demons.

26
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,750
They won't survive a year.

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,832
They all died 799 years ago.

28
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,707
To be honest, Idatens sacrificed their lives for nothing.

29
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:53,125
In fact, Idatens only needed to take turns
to seal them for one year.

30
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,240
But it's not just Rin.
Other Idatens didn't know that either.

31
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,667
Actually, there is no difference.

32
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,875
In this case, it's unnecessary for the demons
to break the seal to turn the table.

33
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,917
(IN FAST EXPLANATION)
It's not true. Because the Demon Lord was born out of it.

34
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,957
It's incredible that the doctor exists.

35
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:06,750
How on earth does he actually

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,832
manipulate the machine that
can truly express human emotions and habits?

37
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:10,457
Does he use hundreds of buttons and handles
for precision operation?

38
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,625
Or does he make the machine synchronized with human
so that it can sweat and blink?

39
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,750
Current technology can achieve neither.

40
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,332
But there's a way to achieve
such complicated operations.

41
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,957
It's what Prontea once used, operating it with mind.

42
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,082
This method is feasible.

43
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:21,457
Isli, you mean

44
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,457
the Demon Lord is an Idaten?

45
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:26,207
(Episode 6 Smoke)
I've checked it with General Pisara.

46
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,042
The way they found us was

47
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,707
to hack into the cameras in this country,

48
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:35,000
even the ones not connected to the internet.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,250
No one can do it except Idatens.

50
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,250
Instead of trying to figure it out by myself,

51
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,080
why don't I just ask you?

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,819
Who are you?

53
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,917
What's wrong, Miku?

54
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,719
Are you doubting me?

55
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:53,125
Yeah, I really care about your identity.

56
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:57,180
It's the first time someone has asked me so directly.

57
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,457
The Demon Lord is an Idaten.

58
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,625
How about this?

59
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,520
Paula's assumption is the closest
to the correct answer.

60
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:09,082
The Demon Lord is an Idaten
born out of the demon tribe.

61
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,500
There are three conditions for an Idaten to be born.

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,917
The thoughts of a large number of creatures,
the soul asking for help,

63
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,583
and hundreds of years.

64
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,166
The Idatens who sacrificed their lives,

65
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,041
the weak and dying demons,

66
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,208
and 800 years.

67
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,958
This seal perfectly satisfies these three conditions.

68
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,420
He was born out of the thoughts of dying demons,

69
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,139
so he protects the demons.

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,959
He also acquired intelligence from the dead Idatens.

71
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,125
Whatever. Check me up as you please.

72
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,916
Tell me if you find anything,

73
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,600
because I don't even know who I am.

74
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,680
Because he was born
after recombination and decomposition,

75
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,199
his memory is chaos.

76
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,680
His body can't leave the spell, either.

77
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,560
I don't think he can understand his own identity.

78
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,333
That's why he can only send out thoughts

79
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,480
and let people know his existence through machines.

80
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,300
This is the true identity of the Demon Lord.

81
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,125
What should we do next, Isli?

82
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,583
Now that we know where the Demon Lord is,

83
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,000
it's all about whether we should kill him or not.

84
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,125
You're fast but weak.

85
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,208
So...

86
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,333
In this way, I'm the only one who can attack.

87
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,291
You don't even have the strength to escape.

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,125
It's not over yet...

89
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,458
No, it's over.

90
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,208
Fast speed and good response.

91
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,625
But attack like this

92
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,083
doesn't work at all.

93
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,041
How about this?

94
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,583
Are you an idiot?

95
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,041
Even if you're fast, for linear attack,

96
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,916
I can knock you down as long as the timing is right.

97
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,319
Is this the end?

98
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,708
Damn. I didn't expect myself to be so weak.

99
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,750
How should I use this body?

100
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,000
A teenager seems worried.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,666
You're disgusting.

102
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,041
Why do you come out of the ground?

103
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,375
It doesn't matter.

104
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,779
You want to know
how to improve your attack power, right?

105
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,541
Yeah.

106
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,625
Good, then let me start the explanation.

107
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,666
FOR GROWING GOOD BOYS SCALE

108
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,791
What the hell is this?

109
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,541
As you can see, it's a common scale.

110
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,291
Paula, stand on it.

111
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,583
36 kilograms.

112
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,250
Is there any problem?

113
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,166
Can you turn your weight into "zero"?

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,125
Like this?

115
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,041
No wonder you're good at silent moving.

116
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,208
(IN FAST EXPLANATION)
In this way, you can walk around,

117
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,750
speed up or walk on walls and ceilings
without making a sound.

118
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,666
When attacking, you do the opposite.

119
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,541
As you can see, Idatens are free from the physical laws
such as conservation of mass and air resistance.

120
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,041
In the battle, they can make their weight
close to zero and speed up,

121
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,041
and put on several tons of weight when attacking.

122
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:12,791
It's very simple for Idatens.

123
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,750
Every Idaten can lighten his or her weight.

124
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,791
Even Hayato, who is not good at silent moving,
can also manage to move for a kilometer or two.

125
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,458
But "putting on weight" is another thing,

126
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,833
because it needs strong imagination,
like taking out weapons from your body.

127
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,750
To put on a few tons of weight,
you may need hundreds of years of training.

128
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,916
It only takes a few years
to put on a few hundred kilograms.

129
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,000
Putting on dozens of kilograms only takes a few hours.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,458
If you are a fast learner,
you will learn it in two days.

131
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,208
Paula should be able to learn it soon.

132
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,583
That's true. My weight has increased to 90 kilograms.

133
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,625
Okay, let me have a try.

134
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,125
My original weight is 65 kilograms.

135
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,375
Let me try to get heavier.

136
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,958
It hasn't changed at all.

137
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,019
Aura alone is not enough.

138
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,125
You need to use imagination.

139
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,319
Imagination.

140
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,250
Try this.

141
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,500
Hayato, listen.

142
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,416
Remember the weight of your feet on the ground now.

143
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,208
Imagine this weight is your weight.

144
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,333
Prontea.

145
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,000
Isli.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,666
It's less than a week before Zobul's attack.

147
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,879
Is there a point in this training?

148
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,625
If the training doesn't work,
they don't need to join us in this battle.

149
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,291
I'll train them after that.

150
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,958
Anyway, there will be a final battle
with the Demon Lord one day.

151
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,291
It's all about whether we should kill him or not.

152
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,791
Let's not kill him for now.

153
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,000
He's the integration
of the majority of demons and Idatens.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,582
Who knows how strong he is?

155
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,000
What if our master and I work together?

156
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:45,875
I'm just not sure if we can win.

157
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,082
But one thing is for sure...

158
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:51,457
The Demon Lord can't develop his strength in the seal.

159
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:54,667
That is to say, no matter how long it's been,
he won't even get stronger.

160
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:58,582
You mean we should put aside the trouble,

161
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:01,875
and think about the solution later on.

162
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,082
But this is not my style.

163
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,375
I won't stop you if you want a fight with them.

164
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,707
But if you want to break the seal,

165
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:10,875
convince Rin yourself.

166
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:15,000
And after the seal is removed, Rin can move freely.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,832
You're right.

168
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:18,917
Let's take some time to find a perfect countermeasure.

169
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:20,457
Even so,

170
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:24,279
one day we still have to fight the Demon Lord.

171
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,332
It seems that I have to start practicing, too.

172
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:30,542
I hate it. I really want to continue with my research.

173
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:34,000
How much longer do you want me to carry this?

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,332
Until your body memorizes this weight.

175
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:41,292
Since you still say "how much longer",
you haven't remembered it yet.

176
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,917
Put on weight and try to hit me again.

177
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,332
Let's see how much weight you can achieve.

178
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:54,207
I can change from 36 into 90 kilograms,

179
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,125
so my weight can be multiplied.

180
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,042
You do get heavier,

181
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,207
but slower, too.

182
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:10,707
You shouldn't increase your weight until the last moment
of hitting the target.

183
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:13,957
It's hard.

184
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,250
Paula can put on weight,

185
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,667
but can't accurately grasp the timing.

186
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:24,417
It seems there is still a long way to go
before they can use it in the battle.

187
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:28,457
This guy probably knew it from the beginning.

188
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:36,042
Will it ever end or not?

189
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:41,707
General Pisara.

190
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,417
Let's fight one more time.

191
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,792
It doesn't matter to me.

192
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,957
He's really so impatient.

193
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:52,500
Judging by the way he behaves,

194
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,750
I don't think he's grasped it yet,

195
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,082
and he also can't find out where his problem lies.

196
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:03,792
Put on weight, as heavy as...

197
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:04,832
that rock.

198
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,667
What?

199
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,625
Awesome!

200
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,542
I really got stronger.

201
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:28,125
Prontea, you're super strong.

202
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,625
Oh, thank you.

203
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:33,917
Why?

204
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,500
Now let me be your opponent

205
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,207
to prove the hit just now was not a coincidence.

206
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:45,750
It's just as I wish. Let's do it.

207
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,667
What?

208
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:58,125
He can even well manage the continuous hits
that is hard to handle.

209
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,167
This guy is indeed a genius.

210
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,207
I got it!

211
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:10,207
When Hayato attacked before,
he never resumed his weight, did he?

212
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:14,820
In a sense, this is just right.

213
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:18,792
Illusion alone can increase the weight of attack.

214
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,167
Prontea.

215
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,292
You're right.

216
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,332
Are you kidding me?

217
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:31,750
The weight of his attack before
is only a few kilograms.

218
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,457
It means he has made it that far in just 80 years.

219
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,792
This is really unbelievable.

220
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,832
Awesome. Your attack is perfect.

221
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,332
You win.

222
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:57,000
Awesome!

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,167
Is this the kind of Idaten who pursues pure strength?

224
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:07,125
Okay, three of you, come together.

225
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,457
Do you need a rest?

226
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,332
Hayato, it's not necessary.

227
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,820
Let me be your opponent.

228
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,167
Instead of carrying the rock,

229
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,667
my way is more suitable for him.

230
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,957
It's fighting with bare hands. I'll go easy on you.

231
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:27,082
I won't dodge your attack.

232
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:30,332
You just try and hurt me.

233
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:33,542
Really? I just complimented you,

234
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,457
but it turns out you are still so annoying.

235
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:38,457
Don't underestimate me.

236
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:56,019
Damn. It's still hard to defeat him.

237
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,159
He's a monster.

238
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,139
He's too strong.

239
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:03,100
And we wanted to be enemies with them.

240
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,419
I'm still scared at the thought of it.

241
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,340
Sister Pisara.

242
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,917
It's almost time for regular communication.

243
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,059
What shall we do?

244
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,179
Now there are two options.

245
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,332
We can remain silent and not contact them,

246
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,759
or we can lie to buy some time.

247
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:18,980
But...

248
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,799
According to the tape, they are not threat at all.

249
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,957
Isn't he inexplicably weak?

250
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:42,667
He's strong actually,
but he doesn't know about it at all.

251
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:46,375
If he is at his best,

252
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,375
compared to me, who's stronger?

253
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:53,292
I don't think he can defeat you.

254
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,457
Right.

255
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:57,000
That's for sure.

256
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,750
But others may lose.

257
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,792
No, they already have.

258
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,500
What does that mean?

259
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,375
Pisara and the other two
didn't make the regular contact.

260
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,542
Miku will see right through those crappy lies.

261
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,957
So it's better to keep silent.

262
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:21,917
Those three were not defeated, were they?

263
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:27,332
No, maybe they're captured alive and
have leaked our information.

264
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,332
No way.

265
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:32,457
Even if Nepto and Pisara are caught,
they won't tell anything.

266
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:33,667
But there is also Kori.

267
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:37,875
He should not be able to withstand torture
and leak information.

268
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:41,457
Kori gets tortured.

269
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:44,125
Pisara gets sexually abused.

270
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,417
Nepto gets...

271
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,167
I really desire it.

272
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:53,250
Brandy, I can't think.

273
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,250
I'll go to the bathroom and have a rest.

274
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,917
But why are you taking that thing to the bathroom!

275
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,042
Well, I'm going to masturbate.

276
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:03,125
Don't put it so plainly!

277
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,457
She's got no manners at all.

278
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,917
Speaking of those three people...

279
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,667
Demon Lord, and my dear.

280
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,000
Are there any updates?

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,582
Not at all.

282
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,582
Nepto and others didn't contact us either.

283
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:22,207
It seems that they are defeated.

284
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,207
Nickel is gone.

285
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,792
You are the only one left in our main force.

286
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:29,582
Please, Brandy.

287
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:32,082
Yes, leave it to me.

288
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,750
Miku, did you find anything?

289
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,750
Miku looks so serious!

290
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,399
It seems we really are in a crisis!

291
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,639
She's just in the Zen mode.

292
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:56,832
Paula, if you're free,
do you want to come with me to Sabayel?

293
00:16:56,832 --> 00:17:02,082
If we have more people,
it's easier to convince the humans there.

294
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,291
Sure.

295
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:13,916
Damn it. It doesn't work no matter how I attack.

296
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,500
Hey, Hayato.

297
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,000
In addition to adding weight,

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,458
there is also a simple way to increase attack power.

299
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,708
What are they teaching him?

300
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:30,041
Why do you want us here alone?

301
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,083
What's wrong?

302
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,083
Mom.

303
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,125
(FIRST PRINCE KIMOCHI)
There's a reason I ask you to come here.

304
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,583
(SECOND PRINCESS RAQI)
There's a reason I ask you to come here.

305
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,940
(THIRD PRINCE BUZZ)
There's a reason I ask you to come here.

306
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,559
I'll just get this straight.

307
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,208
You three, leave the country right now.

308
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:47,291
Before you leave, you can take a demon you like.

309
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,875
Are there any questions?

310
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,208
Why?

311
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,583
And why do we need to sneak away?

312
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,083
It's to avoid the extinction of the demon tribe.

313
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,708
Now Nepto and the other two are captured alive.

314
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,458
We don't know when the information about the demons
will be leaked.

315
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,083
We can only act in secret for now.

316
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,375
Why is it the three of us that should leave?

317
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,250
There are other brothers and sisters.

318
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,250
This, of course, is because

319
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,208
you three are my own children.

320
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,958
Hey, what are you laughing at?

321
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,833
No, I'm sorry.

322
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:25,083
Mom, you just mentioned demon extinction
and that our information may be leaked.

323
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,208
These reasons sound like a big deal,

324
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,500
but in fact, you just want your children to run away.

325
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,250
You are obviously a laissez-faire parent.

326
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,083
I didn't expect you to care for your children.

327
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,666
It surprises us so much.

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,125
Stop talking and leave now, or I'll kill you.

329
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,833
I know, mom.

330
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,583
I'll run. I'll run right away.

331
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,041
Mom, don't push yourself too hard.

332
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,791
Please be careful.

333
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,708
Okay, you should be careful, too.

334
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:07,625
They didn't expect me to care for my children.

335
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,375
I didn't expect it, too.

336
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,041
Lord Kimochi is awesome.

337
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,833
Ferrandia.

338
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,333
It's time to travel. Why don't you come with me?

339
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,166
I'm not like you. I'm busy.

340
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,119
(FERRANDIA BOSS OF THE SEVENTH PROSTITUTE STREET OF ZOBUL)
I don't have time to have fun with you.

341
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,666
Just come with me.

342
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,583
This is an order from Princess Brandy.

343
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,299
They're just baits.

344
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,541
It seems you are not going to have any fun.

345
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,000
(MELIANOR MAJOR OF ZOBUL AIR FORCE)
Buzz, what can I do for you?

346
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,958
It's...

347
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,625
Should I tell her the truth?

348
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,125
Or should I confess my feelings for her first
and tell her after she says yes?

349

350
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,875
(COLOT BUTLER OF ZOBUL ROYAL FAMILY)
Yes, Ms. Raqi?

351
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,750
Please take me away.

352
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,166
I'm getting more desperate.

353
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't want to die yet.

354
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,791
I really want to run away.

00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,319
Deities.

356
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,819
If you can't watch this,

357
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,599
please save us.

358
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,333
Faithful believers,

359
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,583
the world needs redemption now.

360
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:26,500
The Zobul Empire that carries out military violence

361
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,083
is no longer grateful for the God.
Hotayena only cares about pleasure.

362
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,875
They are all blasphemous wickedness.

363
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,583
And we must save these people

364
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,625
with death.

365
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:47,208
Their souls can only be saved by the purification
of us messengers of God.

366
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,916
Redeem demons.

367
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,833
Purify demons.

368
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,958
Limited wealth and resources

369
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:57,416
should be solely owned by authorities.

370
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,833
And it's just us,

371
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,625
the messengers of God, qualified to manage everything.

372
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,625
What?

373
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,250
Although I have heard about it for a long time,
this statement is really too much.

374
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,666
To put it plainly, people who have different ideas from you
are not qualified, right?

375
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,750
What are you talking about? That's rude.

376
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,750
Who are you anyway?

377
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,000
Hello, nice to meet you.

378
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,666
We are the Deities.
