1
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,875
Do you think you can take me down
if you two come together?

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,125
Run!

3
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:21,917
Hayato!

4
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,292
I'll chew you up!

5
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,832
Let him go!

6
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,582
- Damn it!
- Stop, stop!

7
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:32,292
You can't see the front, can you?

8
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,042
Well, then I can also defeat you!

9
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,375
I didn't expect it would work.

10
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,625
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

11
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,000
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

12
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,542
You guys are so mean!

13
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,707
Who cares!

14
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:24,957
Nice shot.

15
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,582
Hello, demon.

16
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:35,667
Do you know you can't look at the sun
through a magnifier?

17
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,042
To be honest, I don't know what that means, either.

18
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,875
I can't believe he's tricking me.

19
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,875
It looks like the flash bang works for you guys.

20
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,207
Is the exit blocked?

21
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:53,832
Alright.

22
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,292
Before your eyes recover, let's have a little talk,

23
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,042
just to kill the time.

24
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:03,292
General Pisara, you are smart.

25
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:05,250
To kill an opponent as weak as I am,

26
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,082
you lured me here to wipe me out once and for all.

27
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:13,457
It means you understand the situation now.

28
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:17,957
You've been aware that the demons don't stand a chance.

29
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:21,792
I know what you're thinking.

30
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,750
You plan to kill the three of us
before we grow stronger.

31
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,207
Next, you'll just wait
until you are ready to handle Rin.

32
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:30,875
Am I right?

33
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,707
Whatever.

34
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:39,542
You all have to die today anyway.

35
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,792
Yeah, I could have been killed by you.

36
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,542
But the demons attacking the other two of us

37
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,875
will be knocked down by Prontea.

38
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:08,159
It seems that you have done your best.

39
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,360
I get it.

40
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,792
It's my turn to attack this time.

41
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,833
It turns out bare hands are the most powerful.

42
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,125
Rin is not the only one who can defeat the demons.

43
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,000
It's the demons that are too naive.

44
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,151
Demons used to have no intelligence.

45
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:41,166
It's a tribe posing threats
with population and brutality.

46
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,625
So what?

47
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,416
No matter what you say,
it won't change the fact that you're going to die.

48
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,500
Keep talking, idiot.

49
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,708
Will I?

50
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,791
As long as I make my escape,
I can get Prontea to come here.

51
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,000
You'll be the one to die.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,375
That's it. Keep talking.

53
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,125
One more thing.

54
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,041
Having intelligence sometimes hurts yourself.

55
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,375
Idiot, it won't work if you use it for the second time.

56
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,333
What are you doing?

57
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,041
Do you think this will harm me?

58
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,208
That's true.

59
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,375
Just tearing your clothes has taken me a lot of effort.

60
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,416
You have nice boobs.

61
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,875
Nasty!

62
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,458
See? You'll freak out over such boring little things.

63
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:45,583
The most important task of demons
is to produce more offsprings.

64
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:46,899
So I guess,

65
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,958
Your strangely high intelligence has also increased
your self-esteem as a result.

66
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,500
Because you no longer undertake the task,

67
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,625
you become ashamed when naked.

68
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,416
It's like a virgin who has never seen the world.

69
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,541
Bastard.

70
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,208
I'm gonna kill you!

71
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,583
I will definitely kill you!

72
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,541
Go to hell!

73
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,750
What?

74
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,208
It doesn't work for me.

75
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,291
The very first demon attacking us
already showed it to me.

76
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,416
Was it Nickel?

77
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,125
What on earth do you want this time?

78
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,958
What? He just stands there without doing anything.

79
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,541
What on earth does he want?

80
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,860
Poison.

81
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:45,041
He has intended to release toxic gas from the beginning.
That's why he kept talking?

82
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,333
But why does the toxic gas work for me?

83
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,208
The poison that's not effective immediately
is effective for pure demons.

84
00:06:55,208 --> 00:07:00,000
But you have human brains.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,625
The human mind can endure a certain degree of pain,

86
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,416
but can also easily succumb to pleasure.

87
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:11,291
Yes, it's a mixture of
anesthetic and aphrodisiac in high concentration.

88
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,916
If you had just taken the risk to attack me directly.

89
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,875
I would be dead now.

90
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,875
Because of the intelligence you are not familiar with,

91
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,291
you are scared of taking risks, so you failed.

92
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,458
You can't hear these anyway.

93
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,833
The opponent can't do anything with
Hayato's defense and regeneration.

94
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,916
- and Hayato can't give the critical strike.
- This is so disgusting.

95
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,875
Hayato will win in a few hours.

96
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,458
But this is too boring.

97
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,250
Let's do the final experiment.

98
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,666
Paula, can you hear me?

99
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,208
Prontea.

100
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,708
Fight with that sword.

101
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,708
This sword is the same as master's,

102
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,958
but my sword can be used without me.

103
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,916
To put it plainly, I'm lending you my power.

104
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,208
Okay.

105
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
It seems that you are equipped with the best weapon
at the start of the game.

106
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,375
Paula, lend the sword to Hayato.

107
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,625
Hayato, here you go.

108
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,957
Hold on.

109
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,167
Wait, I surrender. I lost. Please don't use that.

110
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:41,250
Please, spare my life.

111
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,875
What's the point of defeating you
with this kind of thing.

112
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,207
Come on.

113
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,542
Let's settle this with our bare hands.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,042
He's not interested at all.

115
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:58,417
It seems he simply wants to be stronger.

116
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,875
What do you want to do to me?

117
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,042
Now that I have captured you alive,

118
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,500
of course I want to do something fun.

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,417
Don't. Please just kill me.

120
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,957
What are you thinking?

121
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,500
Don't worry.

122
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,582
Maybe those nasty things are even better.

123
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:26,417
But I'm a scientist.

124
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,875
The bed that excites me is the operating table.

125
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,957
And what I insert is the scalpel.

126
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,917
I was born naturally.

127
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:37,167
I didn't know what I was before I met Hayato.

128
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:41,875
To find out who I am,

129
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,250
I have dissected countless human beings.

130
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,042
I am very good at playing with human brains.

131
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:52,966
Episode 5 Nasty

132
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:59,417
No anomalies are found in the first fleet

133
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,167
- What's in your mind, Brandy?
- No anomalies are found in the second fleet.

134
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,167
- She's not even moving. I'm tired.
- No anomalies are found in the third fleet.

135
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,957
- Then get Miku here to take a look.
- No anomalies are found in all fleets.

136
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:10,207
Get Miku?

137
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:15,125
You have been played by the soldiers for so many days,

138
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,625
but you still look so tough.

139
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,792
I won't give in to humiliation.

140
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:22,625
I advise you to stop this now...

141
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,332
What are you doing? Stop...

142
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:29,832
Violence is indeed useless to you.

143
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:34,667
Because of your strong heart,
you won't give in even if you are humiliated.

144
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,792
But you came twice yesterday.

145
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,332
I didn't!

146
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,667
You're scared.

147
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:47,167
The pleasure of your first orgasm is so strong.

148
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:50,917
No matter how painful it is, you can take it.

149
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,917
But you are so easy to succumb to pleasure.

150
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,750
Don't. Stop it!

151
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,625
Okay, I'll stop.

152
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:02,250
I stopped.

153
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,667
Why do you stop before I was about to come?

154
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,139
That's not true!

155
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,250
Miku, go to the control room.

156
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,625
Brandy.

157
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,167
Come on, I'm at a critical moment of the training.

158
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,875
Do I have to go?

159
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,625
Gradually, I'm about to let her enjoy
the pleasure of continuous orgasm.

160
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,279
Stop it now and come here.

161
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,625
Okay.

162
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,542
You're in good luck.

163
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,292
Queen Brandy.

164
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,875
Your country manipulates people at will.

165
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,332
You will be punished by God one day.

166
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,417
Aren't you afraid of God?

167
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,220
God? God is scary.

168
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:55,332
Honestly, I didn't expect them to be that strong.

169
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,207
What do you mean?

170
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,875
I don't know.

171
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:05,625
If you are really the messenger of God,
just ask him yourself.

172
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,542
You can't stand up already?

173
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,500
Then I win.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,917
I hate it.

175
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:31,207
It took six hours, which is faster than I thought.

176
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,667
Got it.

177
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,375
Welcome, Nepto, Kori.

178
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,625
Please gratefully take
Mr. Isli's brain-washing operation,

179
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,582
and become one of us.

180
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,350
IN OPERATION

181
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,186
DEMON GANG

182
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,792
ALL KILLED

183
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,917
(RECRUIT PETE HUMAN)
No anomalies were found on all the monitors.

184
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:57,832
The target is not moving.

185
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:00,667
Hi, are you looking for me?

186
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,457
Miku, what do you think about it?

187
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:04,750
Let me see.

188
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,832
It's nice to have a young boy here.

189
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:09,875
How old are you, little brother?

190
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,417
What are you doing?

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,542
Let me ask you again. What do you think about it?

192
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,917
I have to watch it a little longer
before getting a clue.

193
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:24,125
How dare she behave like this in front of the Emperor?

194
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,000
Why did the Emperor get a trainer here?

195
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:29,960
Both of them are done.

196
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,250
Are they okay?

197
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,750
Don't worry. They'll get used to it.

198
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,000
All right, please tell me

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,832
the population of demons left
and more information about the Zobul Empire.

200
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,750
Okay, no problem.

201
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:50,292
(IN FAST DESCRIPTION)
There are 359 demons left,

202
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,667
three of which are dangerous ones.

203
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:52,500
They are Brandy, Queen of Zobul Empire,

204
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,332
Takeshita, Emperor of Zobul Empire,

205
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,167
and Umeyo, the birth mother.

206
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,375
These three are stronger than me and Nepto,

207
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,792
especially Brandy.

208
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:57,542
Umeyo's strength lies in

209
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,667
her power to suppress the new demons,

210
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,542
take them into her body temporarily,

211
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:01,582
and fuse them with human beings,

212
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,750
so that the demons will have
human shape and intelligence.

213
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,667
They take the women of Zobul

214
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,792
and train them for this purpose.

215
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,207
At first they let the soldiers do whatever they want,

216
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,750
but they were so abusive
that the women became infertile.

217
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,707
Some of them even committed suicide.

218
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:09,500
This became pointless.

219
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,207
So now the soldiers are only allowed to
rape women in the war.

220
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:14,082
In this way, there are a lot of soldiers
volunteering to go the forefront of the battlefield.

221
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,167
What's wrong?

222
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,667
No. I thought information like this

223
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,832
will make you a little upset,

224
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:26,042
but you look like as if you don't care.

225
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,957
I thought Idatens side with humans.

226
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:32,042
We do.

227
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:36,250
But we don't interfere with
human rights and moral ethics created by themselves.

228
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,917
Then there won't be so much trouble.

229
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:42,375
The long-haired guy and the monster on the island

230
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,707
can just go and destroy Zobul and human beings together.

231
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:48,500
No, destroying Zobul without any plan

232
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,042
will harm the balance of human society.

233
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,625
It's also very hard to fight Hotayena and Sabayel.

234
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:58,792
Anyway, for anything related to human, leave it to me.

235
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,667
You guys just follow my plan.

236
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,000
Go back to Zobul as spies and
secretly pass on information to me.

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,332
I'm afraid this might be hard.

238
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:08,457
Why?

239
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:11,207
Is it required that they must come back dead?

240
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,582
This is one of the reasons.

241
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:15,917
The other is that Miku is in Zobul.

242
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,582
She is another tough opponent.

243
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:24,417
Little brother, tell the sixth fleet
to stay 15 kilometers away from the shore,

244
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:28,207
and then tell the first to fifth fleets
to be two kilometers nearer.

245
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,082
Miku, will this change anything?

246
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,625
I guess,

247
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,542
in this way, the mysterious woman
won't be crossing her arms any more.

248
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,957
And she may move her feet, too.

249
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:43,582
What does she mean? I don't understand it at all.

250
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:45,875
Miku? Who is she?

251
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,332
Is she strong?

252
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:49,292
No, not strong.

253
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,957
Her job is to train the captured women.

254
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:56,167
I think even the twin-tall-hair girl can defeat her.

255
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,625
Me?

256
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,917
Let me start with the basics.

257
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,082
(IN FAST DESCRIPTION)
The way we demons fuse

258
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,875
is to pair humans with demon babies
during their growth.

259
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,707
And the fuse happens slowly.

260
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:05,082
This method is more natural.

261
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:07,250
Therefore, the transforming part and force
can be very unstable.

262
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,500
In order to eliminate the unstable elements,

263
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,750
the fusion process is interfered,

264
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,832
and thus Miku and Bacode were born.

265
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:12,000
As far as the result is concerned, it is a failure.

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,792
They can't transform,
and they have lost most of their strength.

267
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,082
But it's not all bad.

268
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:16,707
Some strength flew into the nervous system
and created some side effects.

269
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,250
Bacode can handle a large amount of information.

270
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,625
Miku has the super power to perceive.

271
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:28,750
You see? She's moving!

272
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,457
I think they can see it immediately
that we've been brain-washed.

273
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:37,042
She really moved. Why?

274
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,000
And what does it mean?

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,707
Well,

276
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,542
let's talk outside.

277
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,375
Just now, the mysterious women

278
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:50,167
has been maintaining a posture that can
wipe out all the fleets in an instant.

279
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:54,667
So I changed the fleets formation so that
they can't be annihilated in that way.

280
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,707
Don't you think it's strange, Emperor?

281
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,167
No, what's strange?

282
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,000
If she doesn't want to kill any humans,

283
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,166
she could just run away rather than posture like that.

284
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,625
Why does she insist on staying there?

285
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,625
There is only one answer.

286
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:15,041
She's there protecting something.

287
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,333
What on earth is she protecting?

288
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,583
How is it? Any updates?

289
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,833
Demon Lord.

290
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,541
Have you fixed your body?

291
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,125
Yeah, I just did.

292
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:34,083
That brat ruined it without any mercy.

293
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,416
She's protecting something?

294
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,791
I think it should be the previous seal
of the demon tribe.

295
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,208
The previous seal of the demon tribe?

296
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,750
It's the seal that trapped
the demon tribe 800 years ago.

297
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,208
If it's destroyed,
we can reverse the situation at once.

298
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,875
Miku, do you think so?

299
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,333
Not really.

300
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,416
Emperor has done a lot of readings,
but is not smart enough.

301
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,125
There will be three problems.

302
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,625
PROBLEM 1

303
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,750
First, we don't know how to unseal it.

304
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,083
(PROBLEM 2)
Second, how to destroy the island protected by Rin.

305
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,666
No one can do it at present.

306
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,458
That's true.

307
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,458
(PROBLEM 3)
Resurrecting tons of demons who have no intelligence

308
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,500
will not only bother them, but also me.

309
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,208
They will attack anyone.

310
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,666
Right.

311
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:36,791
But It's really interesting that we already know
the location of the seal.

312
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,416
I was looking forward to the war,

313
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,833
but now it seems that we can only take other measures.

314
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,500
How do we destroy the island protected by Rin?

315
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,375
Rin.

316
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:54,875
How did the Demon Lord know the name of that Idaten?

317
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:01,250
The doctor, Demon Lord Oobami...
What's his real identity?

318
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,250
Demon Lord.

319
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,708
(IN FAST DESCRIPTION)
He gives us human shape and intelligence.

320
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,291
He's the leader of the society.

321
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,125
But he only shows up through the program.

322
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,375
No one knows his true identity.

323
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,041
70 years ago, when Takeshita and I were young,

324
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,416
Demon Lord, at that time as Emperor Obama,
reigned over the Zobul Empire.

325
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,416
Demon Lord is just an ordinary human being.

326
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,250
He used the demon tribe in order to dominate the world.

327
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,416
This story was once popular among the demon tribe.

328
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,500
But one day he used the excuse that
it will be doubtful if he is still alive at this age.

329
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,458
He gave up the throne to Takeshita,
and faked his own death.

330
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,416
After that, as Oobami,
he enrolled in the chemistry class in the army.

331
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,250
He said it's the only way to buy more time
to increase the number of demons.

332
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,166
But this job will take hundreds of years,

333
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,083
while his life span is too long to be like a human.

334
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,541
During the process, the guy in the program
might have been changed.

335
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,750
If this is a systematic organization,

336
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,833
it possibly makes most people pretend to live a long life,
so that they could win over the demons.

337
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,291
Hold on.

338
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,166
Is it...

339
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,041
But how is that possible?

340
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:44,500
Suppose the Demon Lord is human,
but he lives way too long.

341
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,833
If he is a pure demon, he should not have intelligence.

342
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,875
The Demon Lord is an Idaten.

343
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,041
How about this?

344
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,541
Then why should he be your enemy?

345
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't know the specific reasons, too.

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
By the way, just like we are
a collection of human thoughts,

347
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,416
Demon King is an Idaten born naturally
from demons' thoughts.

348
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,583
Does that make sense?

349
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,250
It is impossible.

350
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,333
If Demon Lord is an Idaten,

351
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,833
he should have known more about Idatens.

352
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,250
We've been talking for too long.

353
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,458
Let's have a rest.

354
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,125
I agree.

355
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,583
Can I leave this difficult meeting?

356
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,958
Hey, let's resume our training.

357
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,375
Let me have a word with Prontea first.

358
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,250
Is that alright?

359
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,208
Sure.

360
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,833
Wait, what about my training?

361
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:47,416
Don't worry. I left you some homework.

362
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:51,375
Why don't you knock down these three people first?

363
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,666
I see. This homework is really good.

364
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,416
General Pisara.

365
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,916
Yes.

366
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,083
Is the Demon Lord...

367
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
That's right.

368
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,875
Isli, this is really not you.

369
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,583
Why do you pause the meeting at such a bad time?

370
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,791
Did you find something?

371
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,166
Yeah, I know everything.

372
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,791
The doctor that they call Demon Lord...

373
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,875
I already know what he really is.
