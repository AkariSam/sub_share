1
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,079
The target runs into a mall.

2
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm here. What should I do?

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,019
There are police outside.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,199
Could you go inside and get her?

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,100
Okay.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,240
Where is she?

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,140
This is weird, Isli.

8
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,759
I've checked everywhere, even underground,
but still couldn't find her.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,000
Is she tricking us?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,020
Or is she hiding somewhere?

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,460
No, why would she do that?

12
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,640
Miku said that

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,820
(Episode 11 Blood)
making the other side wonder about

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,480
how we get away and why we're doing this
would mean our winning.

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,620
Well, she's totally right.

16
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:24,418
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

17
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:42,037
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

18
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:52,979
I didn't see anything close to her kind.

19
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,939
Where is she?

20
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,639
You're fast, but not so strong.

21
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,740
You...

22
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,889
Paula, get away.

23
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,560
Demon!

24
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,400
Ah!

25
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,280
Master Rin, Kori is our friend...

26
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,479
Don't kill him...

27
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,960
Pau... Paula, are you okay?

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,419
I think so... but I'm not sure...

29
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,020
Close her wound, tightly.

30
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,360
She should recover soon.

31
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,659
Really?

32
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,020
Who are you?

33
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,199
Are you one of them?

34
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,680
Well...

35
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,740
What's going on?

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,740
Hey, old hag. What brings you here?

37
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,240
You're finally yourself?

38
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,680
Paula is seriously injured... but it's not new.

39
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,379
Those demon-like creatures appearing lately,

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,781
the demon

41
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,209
that is regarded by Paula as a friend and takes care of her,

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
and

43
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,600
the old man with my grandpa's memory,

44
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,279
what's going on here?

45
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,500
Why are there so many police?

46
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,399
It's said a criminal ran inside.

47
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,740
It's said someone was killed.

48
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,259
That sounds so scary.

49
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,529
It seems her trick is working.

50
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,120
Hayato!

51
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,100
Yes, old hag?

52
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,500
What on earth is going on? Tell me!

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,100
Huh? From me?

54
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,860
Hey, Kori,

55
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:58,990
could you stop touching my boobs?

56
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,319
What? Well...

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Sorry.

58
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,079
It hurts.

59
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,560
Eh, that's why?

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,100
Well, concerning what's going on...

61
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,920
we smashed the demons' base,

62
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,666
and Isli and Prontea are chasing down the ones
that got away.

63
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,600
That's what's going on.

64
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,583
He knows how to summarize!

65
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,958
That's it?

66
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,869
Then I have a question.

67
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,666
There was a man with my grandpa's memory.

68
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,800
Why?

69
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,108
What? What are you talking about?

70
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,170
Damn.

71
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,463
General Pisara.

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,300
Cut off the connection of all the devices,

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,259
cameras, bugs and others on the island where Hayato is.

74
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,055
If it shows in the computer, Demon Lord will see it.

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,519
I'm trying my best to not let him learn about Rin's past.

76
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,458
It should be impossible for them

77
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,608
to figure out that "Demon Lord is a sealed Idaten".

78
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,110
But, Miku is another story.

79
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,988
She needs only a bit of a clue...

80
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,074
The more they talk, the more information gets leaked.

81
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,411
Should I ask Kori to come back...

82
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,208
and delete some of his memories?

83
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,670
It'll be the best if we can catch two. One will do, too.

84
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,298
As for the right time...

85
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,800
it should be when Kori comes back to Zobul.

86
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,958
According to Demon Lord,

87
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,250
he's the only Idaten who can make some operation plans.

88
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,875
Right, others don't even know as much as the public.

89
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,519
So, getting rid of him is enough.

90
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,920
You can't get me with just power.

91
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,875
(NO PIPELINE)
People should be obligated to buy women.

92
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,416
(ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING BY JUST HAVING SEX)
We can't do normal jobs.

93
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,800
A rich man should be able to have over a thousand wives.

94
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,166
- What's going on with the march? - Obligation! Obligation!

95
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,083
They have been controlled by Miku so long
and get used to that type of work.

96
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,588
They don't want to do normal work anymore.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,466
Miku has left us a big mess.

98
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,552
General Pisara, you should take a break.

99
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,012
Thanks for worrying about me.

100
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,682
But these years, you haven't taken a break.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
I'd feel bad if I go rest.

102
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,791
Well, we're made differently.

103
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,916
Go. I'll see you later.

104
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,903
Okay, then I'll take a little break.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,447
He's an amazing man.

106
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,201
He's been working without any sleep or breaks,

107
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,000
so different from other men.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,480
All this time we've been staying alone,

109
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,290
he's never thinking about harassing me or whatever.

110
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,375
Actually, we can get closer...

111
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,750
Stop! What am I thinking?

112
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,916
General Pisara, are you okay?

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,899
What's wrong?

114
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,833
Shut up! I'm tired.

115
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,958
Right, it's because I'm tired.

116
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,416
Yep, I'm gonna take a nap.

117
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,062
You're dead if you dare to disturb me.

118
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,100
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,416
SHOWER ROOM DO NOT ENTER

120
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,875
Nice timing.

121
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,333
Since we've known our enemies,

122
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,180
we just need to focus on strengthening our power.

123
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,004
Shoot, this is the same like before.

124
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,333
Well, since the monster hag is back,

125
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,300
they probably don't need me anymore.

126
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,559
Speak of the devil. Here's the returning command.

127
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:40,625
Paula, I don't think you need me here anymore.

128
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm going back to Zobul.

129
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,792
Okay, safe trip...

130
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,792
Also, they want me to bring you back, too,

131
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,822
but they didn't tell me why.

132
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,082
Really? I'll go.

133
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,679
And if it's okay, I don't wanna come back anymore.

134
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,253
What's wrong with the exhaust fan? It's getting so foggy.

135
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,673
System administrator, wait for my punishment.

136
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:10,174
What a drag.

137
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,919
This is...

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,299
the same drug used right then...

139
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,440
Who is it...

140
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,399
How is it possible?

141
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,340
Only I can open this door...

142
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:38,535
The drugs for human brain are instantly effective.

143
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,789
It's just a normal soldier. Why?

144
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,125
How dare you... poison me.

145
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,240
Don't look!

146
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,625
Pisara, don't be shy.

147
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,059
I've seen your nude several times during check-ups.

148
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,846
Are you... Demon Lord...

149
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,375
Having a mechanic body is the best.

150
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,100
I can be anyone.

151
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:12,620
The place where demons are found

152
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,638
are almost all around this area.

153
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,500
General Pisara is so slow.

154
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,600
She must be having a tight sleep.

155
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:26,875
Sorry for being late.

156
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,052
I have a question.

157
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,047
Where is Prontea now?

158
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,759
He's around the Gainer Coast,

159
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,679
looking for Raqi and Colot...

160
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,500
Really? This is enough.

161
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,667
You bastard.

162
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,399
Don't worry. This won't kill you now.

163
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:53,500
A death like this won't satisfy me.

164
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,239
Pisara is mad?

165
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:59,139
Damn, my brain-washing doesn't work on her anymore.

166
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,955
What? Do you plan to put explosives on me

167
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,875
or blow this room up?

168
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,833
Or contact Prontea?

169
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,649
You need to use the gadgets in your body,

170
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,792
but if you can't start them, all of them are useless.

171
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,139
Why can't I start them?

172
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,082
So, if I turn off all the electrical equipment,

173
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:20,639
you can't do anything.

174
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,349
Peter? No, is it Demon Lord?

175
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,133
I see. That Miku was also you.

176
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,625
You changed your face and clothes in the mall...

177
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,860
Bingo.

178
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,100
If you found it out right then, the plan wouldn't work.

179
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,375
Merku, Demon Lord's plan is going very well.

180
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:43,660
Really? Then I don't have to
make simulated human skins anymore.

181
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,957
To be honest, when I was found in the fitting room,

182
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,083
I thought my plan was going to fail.

183
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:54,457
So, someone saw what he's doing.

184
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:57,519
Why didn't he find that?

185
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,222
You two are back.

186
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,062
You need to go to Mr. Isli now.

187
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,532
Kori, I'll ask you to come back when things are done.

188
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,484
Why don't you go and eat something?

189
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,739
Although Pisara said there are no missions for now,

190
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,200
they may need me soon,

191
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
like helping Prontea to find wild demons...

192
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:28,899
What's going on? I feel so sleepy...

193
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,292
Kori is such a gullible boy.

194
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:39,042
It'll be easier for me to operate on him when he's asleep.

195
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,298
Paula!

196
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,167
Where is she?

197
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,724
It's like she doesn't plan to come back.

198
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:50,417
Maybe she ran away because the old hag was too harsh.

199
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,125
Rin's training is indeed hard.

200
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:54,820
Yep.

201
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,152
She probably went back to Zobul with Kori.

202
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,679
I'll ask her.

203
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,455
How could you use humans' tool so easily!

204
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,860
Are you an intelligent Idaten, like Isli?

205
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,085
What are you talking about? It's just a phone.

206
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,919
She doesn't pick it up.

207
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:20,500
Hey, Gil. It's rare to have you calling me.

208
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,740
You're asking me where Paula is?

209
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,625
Well, you shouldn't ask me that, but Isli...

210
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,500
What?

211
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,440
You can't reach the command base?

212
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,940
How's that possible?

213
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:41,611
Isli-kun! General Pisara!

214
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:44,207
Damn, they got us.

215
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,491
But who started it? And how?

216
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,399
With Pisara, Isli won't be defeated easily.

217
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,582
Even if facing a strong enemy,

218
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,207
he should be able to run away by sacrificing General Pisara.

219
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:06,053
That was close.

220
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:07,750
Hey, Demon Lord.

221
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,500
What will happen
if my brain-washing is removed 30 minutes later?

222
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,320
You'll die for sure.

223
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:18,292
Damn. That's brutal.

224
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,707
Should I be angry or worried?

225
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:24,980
Who's it? What happened?

226
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,990
What do you mean?

227
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,207
We can't reach Pisara and Isli.

228
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:32,779
And we got the news that the command base exploded.

229
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,600
Nepto, what are you doing?

230
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm signing treaties and agreements
in the name of the new country

231
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,000
with Sabayel and Hotayena...

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,375
These are not important. Come here now!

233
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,919
No, I'll go to you.

234
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,332
What happened?

235
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,514
No idea. It must be something bad.

236
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,044
Miku has brought a lot of troubles as an enemy.

237
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:56,187
It is going as planned.

238
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,039
We have Pisara and Kori back.

239
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,984
And they still don't know that.

240
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,582
What's our next move?

241
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,875
Well...

242
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,658
let's make no move...

243
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,370
No, you can go more wild.

244
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,000
Right...

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,667
We've finally got two Idaten samples.

246
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,707
How about studying them first?

247
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:23,589
Thoroughly.

248
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:28,019
Alright. Do you know what's gonna happen to you?

249
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,241
Answer me, little girl.

250
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:33,875
I guess I'll be killed.

251
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:38,270
Killed? What a cute answer.

252
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:41,740
The correct answer is that you will have a check-up first,

253
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,625
like whether you're hiding something here,

254
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,082
and so on.

255
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:48,500
So, torture?

256
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,125
What a drag. It will be painful.

257
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:56,500
You'll see what's more painful than death... what?

258
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,940
She's not screaming.

259
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,700
Ouch!

260
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,501
Hey, don't kill her.

261
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,957
Stop acting like it's nothing to you.

262
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:05,582
Ouch!

263
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,301
That's not what I was expecting.

264
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,677
You're next.

265
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:13,806
Anal examination is far from enough.

266
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,076
Let's see all you organs, from esophagus to stomach.

267
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,082
Also his mouth.

268
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:21,500
Pull out all his teeth.

269
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,250
No, cut all his parts below the eyes.

270
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,296
I like how you scream.

271
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,827
The flesh returns to the earth.

272
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,720
The spirit returns to the Lord.

273
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:41,899
We, born with sins, will see you leave.

274
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,259
These are what you say to mourn the dead.

275
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,090
Is it okay to use my way?

276
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,480
Yes, sister.

277
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,159
The form doesn't matter.

278
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,599
What matters is our heartfelt mourning.

279
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,620
Sorry to ask you to do this.

280
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,779
It's fine. That's all I can do.

281
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:12,160
And lately, the boundary between good and evil
has been more than blurry to me.

282
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,734
Reconcile with demons?

283
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,916
Right, isn't it great to resolve everything without battles?

284
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,999
They did care for me.

285
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,167
I believe if you talk it through,
you'll understand each other.

286
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,740
Then reconcile.

287
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,119
Then, we must make it

288
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,880
a place capable of providing
thousands of human babies for demons.

289
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,665
No!

290
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,750
You can't do that?

291
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,166
Then demons need to stop breeding before they die.

292
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,200
How about that?

293
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,653
This is not reconciliation.

294
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,192
It's just a declaration of death sentence.

295
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,319
For Idatens, humans and demons to reconcile,

296
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,140
there must be a solution acceptable to all.

297
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,166
Demon Lord, is everyone here?

298
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,791
It's an abandoned ranch, but it has a facility underground.

299
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,458
That's where Idatens' experiments are going on.

300
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,480
Please let me offer a hand.

301
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,859
I have a lot of feelings for them after all.

302
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,666
Kori, long time no see.

303
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,440
Kori...

304
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,539
According to the god,

305
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,528
Zobul was meant to produce humans who can fuse with demons,

306
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,460
and demons are just trying to expand their race.

307
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,583
This may be too much for the first day.

308
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,414
Don't you die, guys.

309
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Recover soon. Then I'll cut you open again.

310
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,208
I'll use try different ways to torture you again and again.

311
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,839
Kori, so sorry. Today's experiment is already...

312
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,224
What's wrong? You don't look right.

313
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,224
Probably because my brain-washing is just removed.

314
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,500
I'm tired I guess...

315
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,000
Why? My brain-washing should have been removed.

316
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,250
It's better to take a nap and sleep it off.

317
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,900
Ouch...Ouch...

318
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,750
So, please watch them.

319
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,839
Okay.

320
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,944
According to the information provided by Pisara,

321
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,519
the true identity of the Demon Lord is confirmed to be

322
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,720
the Idaten born in the seal.

323
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,666
I'm bored. You'd better have a baby soon.

324
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,509
That's easy for you to say...

325
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,166
I can't agree with their doings as a human being,

326
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,279
but as a creature, I can't deny that

327
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,259
there's a way for all the creatures to co-exist.

328
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,896
I haven't come up with anything yet,

329
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,380
but... isn't there one?

330
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,153
Prontea said that

331
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:06,791
Isli and Paula may be taken away by the enemies.

332
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,998
What?

333
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,480
By whom?

334
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,916
No idea.

335
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,791
Where should we save them?

336
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,083
No idea...

337
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,631
Are they really captured?

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,340
No idea...

339
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:19,279
Are you kidding me?

340
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,958
What do you know at all!

341
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:25,625
Stop! If the phone breaks, I really won't know anything.

342
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,160
- Hayato, stop her! Save me! - Hey, calm down, old hag.

343
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,875
Shut up.

344
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,541
What's going on?

345
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,833
Rin, where are you going?

346
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,000
Of course

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,416
I'm going to look for Isli and Paula.

348
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,059
Does she know where to look for?

349
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,708
Isli! Paula!

350
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,541
Where are you?

351
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,583
Where! Are! You!

352
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,541
Where are you!

353
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,958
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace
