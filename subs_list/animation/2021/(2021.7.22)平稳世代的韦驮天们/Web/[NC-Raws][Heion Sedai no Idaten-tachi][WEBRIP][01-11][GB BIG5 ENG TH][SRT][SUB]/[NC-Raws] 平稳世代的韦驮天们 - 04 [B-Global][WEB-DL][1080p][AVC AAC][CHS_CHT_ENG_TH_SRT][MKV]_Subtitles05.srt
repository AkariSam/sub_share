1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,990
There were actually four Idatens.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,448
The one not mentioned in the files
is remarkably strong.

3
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:20,657
It's said she's an Idaten who has lived for 800 years.

4
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,782
An Idaten that existed before the demons died out.

5
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,448
I didn't expect that
there would still be an Idaten alive.

6
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:29,532
Do we still have Nickel's bug?

7
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:32,198
I remember it's buried inside him.

8
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:35,865
There's been no sound since G-Thirdteen was killed.

9
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:40,281
I think someone has found it
and destroyed it on the spot.

10
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,573
Although it's buried inside,

11
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:46,000
I can spot it as long as it emits radio wave.

12
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:50,656
So it means they've already known it from the beginning,

13
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:55,957
and left it there as a trap to test our strength.

14
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,823
That doesn't sound like good news.

15
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:01,573
What if they come after us...

16
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:03,823
Lord Brandy, please save us.

17
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,031
Stop this nonsense.

18
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:06,947
I can't do this.

19
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:09,364
I don't think I'm good enough yet.

20
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,739
Please don't count on me like that.

21
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,082
Are we all going to be wiped out?

22
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,447
(SHIVERING)
I have felt what adversity is like for the first time.

23
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:21,582
Why are you so excited?

24
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,364
Shut up!

25
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,656
SILENCE

26
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,864
It's true that we can't beat them now,

27
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,781
but we can't hide from them forever.

28
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,552
Or the three weak Idatens

29
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,322
may one day become super strong freaks.

30
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,822
Pisara, Nepto, Kori.

31
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,822
You three

32
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:45,156
go and kill those three Idatens.

33
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,697
You are allowed to use our army to search
and keep an eye on them.

34
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,156
Use the human army?

35
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,239
Yes.

36
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,989
I don't think they're going to attack human soldiers.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,239
We'll hide behind the human soldiers,

38
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,281
and take them down one by one once they separate.

39
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,447
I see.

40
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:01,989
We have human spy on them,

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,822
and attack them when we have the chance.

42
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,239
As long as they side with human,

43
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,573
this is the safest strategy for us.

44
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:11,282
Kill them all.

45
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,448
Since demons hide in the land of mankind,

46
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:15,448
we can't tell who are the demons.

47
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:17,740
Then wipe out the whole country.

48
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,698
It's amazing how she proposes such a horrible solution
with a straight face.

49
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:25,082
The demons will be so shocked.

50
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:38,625
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

51
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,990
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,073
Episode 4 Oriole

53
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:04,365
Isli, where is the place called Zobul?

54
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,198
I'll go and raze it to the ground now.

55
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,240
Calm down, Rin.

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,198
We still don't know the true identity of those demons
and their population.

57
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,823
To come up with a comprehensive countermeasure,

58
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:16,990
why not go and get Prontea?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,416
Prontea?

60
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,240
We do have a larger chance with him.

61
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,531
But I sent him to travel around the world.

62
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,031
I don't know where he is now.

63
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,947
Prontea, he...

64
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,156
Yeah, that's why we need to look for him.

65
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,958
Just give me a week, please.

66
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,740
What are you talking about, Isli?

67
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,865
Prontea is in Hotayena the whole time.

68
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,697
I'll explain it to you later.

69
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,833
Then you'll have one week to find Pronte...

70
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,115
I'm ready, old woman.

71
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,791
Let's get back to the training.

72
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,541
Why are you kicking me all of a sudden?

73
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,406
That stupid apprentice.

74
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,240
He is able to kick Rin all by himself,

75
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,541
and she even moved by a few inches.

76
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,822
What's wrong, old woman? It's over already?

77
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,406
Keep coming.

78
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,156
What is wrong with him?

79
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,031
I'll go make him quiet.

80
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,072
He's recovering faster now.

81
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,656
We are a cluster of collective consciousness.

82
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,906
A stronger mind comes with greater effect on the body.

83
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:27,666
It is determination rather than losing
that makes an Idaten even stronger.

84
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,822
Jeez, why are we spying on those remote islands?

85
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,322
Don't say that.

86
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,740
I heard there're three little kids over there.

87
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,531
This girl with the bunches

88
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,281
though a little too young, is so cute.

89
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,822
Look at her breasts.

90
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,447
If only I can lay my hands on her.

91
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,781
- None of them on the ship has noticed me.
- Do whatever you want, sir.

92
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,197
It seems that they are all human beings.

93
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:56,041
Tens of thousands of people have here surrounded
within only half a day.

94
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,615
When I was young, the population of all the countries
only totalled a few thousand.

95
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,031
There are way too many humans now.

96
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,656
Even if I want to wipe them out,
I may still miss several of them.

97
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,072
It seems that it is better to wait for Prontea to come.

98
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,365
General Pisara.

99
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,656
This woman was been spotted again.

100
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,990
According to the reports from the navy,

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,115
She's all over the place.

102
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,865
Why is it just her?

103
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,947
- They wouldn't have separated already, would they?
- Where was she?

104
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,490
- Did they separate right after the fight with Nickel?
- She vanished and reappeared out of nowhere.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,281
Are they trying to lure us into a trap?

106
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,958
Or are there other reasons?

107
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,240
There are lots of warships.

108
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,197
It's more than I imagined.

109
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,240
Let's walk from the bottom of the sea to Hotayena.

110
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,865
Why not just ask Prontea to come here?

111
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,197
As long as Rin is nearby, he won't come.

112
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,490
Now even if Rin kills Zobul,

113
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,531
it is still difficult to wipe out all the demons.

114
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,240
At present, it seems difficult to kill them altogether.

115
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,322
And even if the Zobul Empire disappears,

116
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,365
we still have to avoid the war
between the other two countries.

117
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,447
If these problems are solved,

118
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,656
we can leave the rest to Rin and Prontea.

119
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,947
The analysis is roughly correct,

120
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,156
but Isli hasn't found out that

121
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,531
he doesn't know everything about the "Demon Lord",

122
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,791
which leads to some errors in strategy analysis.

123
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,656
General Pisara, bad news!

124
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,615
We found Lieutenant G-Thirdteen's body.

125
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,490
Oh, okay.

126
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,031
That's it?

127
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,406
Hold on, something is wrong.

128
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,906
Demon Lord, one question.

129
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,583
Where's the body of Minotaurs?

130
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,406
We had failed to recycle it last time.

131
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,865
Now we've found G-Thirdteen's body,

132
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,156
but not Nickel's.

133
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,990
I have a theory.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,490
Has the Minotaurs' body already been recycled by Idatens?

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,156
This means Nicole's body may also be
at their recycling place.

136
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,240
I think they are looking
into the true identity of demons.

137
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,615
I see. Then they will also
do the research through humans.

138
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,958
And the recycling place should be in Hotayena.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,583
It reached the finish line!

140
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,657
This man is so tall.

141
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:42,197
Our new champion, how did you do that?

142
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:45,740
In fact, there is nothing special
about the transformation.

143
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,365
For me, manipulation is the key.

144
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,490
Got it.

145
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,447
What is your goal of the next game?

146
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:55,615
I won't participate anymore.

147
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,365
Because I have already got satisfactory results.

148
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,832
This is the end of the experiment.

149
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,822
It's you again, Isli.

150
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:06,740
What's up?

151
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,782
Paula and I are on the coast of Zeyo.

152
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,032
Is Paula there, too?

153
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,500
OK, I'll be right there.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,625
Where is he?

155
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,532
Hello, Prontea.

156
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,750
Prontea, long time no see.

157
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,250
I haven't seen both of you for a long time.

158
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:30,792
Idaten... flames.

159
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,822
How is the magic power, Isli?

160
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,947
Don't spit fires all of a sudden.

161
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,957
Is this all you got with your flames?

162
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,072
Sort of.

163
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,832
But I think it's much better than a flamethrower.

164
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:59,115
Looks like you aren't here to hang out with me.

165
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,707
Let's hear it.

166
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,782
Hotayena, the country of freedom,

167
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,907
is home to all the enterprises in the world,

168
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:09,322
and also advocates free competition.

169
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:13,917
It is the safest place in the world for the rich.

170
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:15,947
It's the tall big brother.

171
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:18,365
Big brother, teach us the trick now.

172
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,947
Sorry, I'm occupied today.

173
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:21,782
Prontea, you are so popular.

174
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,990
Because big brother is very capable.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,115
He can find the tricks in no time
that aren't on any of the guide books.

176
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,740
He's a deity.

177
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,282
Tricks not on any of the guide books...

178
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,532
So that was a success, too?

179
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:35,572
Sort of.

180
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:39,947
But it's not as good as you thought.

181
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:42,697
Paula, where are we?

182
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:44,157
Hayato, behave yourself.

183
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,072
This is a city where human beings live.

184
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:49,115
What? Why am I here?

185
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,947
Where is the old woman?

186
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,947
- Is he an Idaten, too?
- The old woman...

187
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:54,572
- So is the head in the box?
- Where are you?

188
00:10:54,582 --> 00:10:58,072
- I'll explain it to you later.
- Where are you, old woman?

189
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:01,197
- Who's the old woman he's talking about?
- What about the special training?

190
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,542
- I'll explain it later, too.
- Show yourself, old woman.

191
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,407
Are they in this country?

192
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,072
But how are we going to find them?

193
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,072
There are many human beings in this country.

194
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:13,407
Don't worry.

195
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:17,447
It's human and the Demon Lord's job to search for them.

196
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,750
Our job is to kill.

197
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,865
Your room has changed a lot.

198
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:34,322
Yeah, these computer images
are linked to my consciousness.

199
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:37,990
Isli discovered a new possible skill of Idatens.

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,167
I'll be the one to make it an reality.

201
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,990
That's where magic comes from.

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,282
I'm not yet capable of putting the theory into practice.

203
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,782
So I really appreciate your efforts.

204
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,615
Don't mention it.

205
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,197
We're going to take this guy to the old woman, aren't we?

206
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,532
What's with this kid's attitude?

207
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,197
And who is the old woman?

208
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,407
Prontea.

209
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:03,332
Please calm down and listen to me.

210
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:07,197
The old woman Hayato talked about

211
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:08,542
is Rin.

212
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,457
It's the same old reaction.

213
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,822
I'm so sorry, master.

214
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:20,865
I shouldn't play video games all the time at home.

215
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,447
But I can't help it.

216
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:25,157
There are no demons anywhere.

217
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,740
What? Why are you taking me to her?

218
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,072
Let me guess...

219
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,157
She's mad at me, isn't she?

220
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,072
I can't do this.

221
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,322
I just can't. I'm going to be killed.

222
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,115
Please don't kill me. I'm sorry.

223
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,407
Help, master.

224
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,822
It's all my fault.

225
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:37,657
I'm so sorry.

226
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,740
Please spare my life.

227
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,447
Master.

228
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:45,282
I'm sorry. Before he calms down, just ignore him.

229
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:46,917
It should take a while.

230
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,407
What is this?

231
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:52,282
Monitors across Hotayena,

232
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:58,072
from official monitors
to individual monitors of ordinary citizens.

233
00:12:58,082 --> 00:13:00,907
Did you hack into the surveillance system?

234
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:06,032
But how did you find individual monitors
that are not connected to the Internet?

235
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,072
Who knows?

236
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:10,792
We don't know what kind of technology Demon Lord used.

237
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,407
That is to say, my master is not mad at me.

238
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,657
Is this true?

239
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,072
It's true.

240
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:21,990
We use the excuse of looking for you

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,282
to get a week's buffer time.

242
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:25,990
So I want to ask you a favor.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,615
In order to win the battle against the demons,

244
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,822
we need you to hack into the computers of Zobul Empire
with your mind,

245
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:33,407
and find out the population of the demons.

246
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,947
There's not much to do anyway.

247
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,782
There should be plenty of time.

248
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:38,865
By the way, Hayato,

249
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,750
would you like to ask Prontea to help with your training?

250
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:45,157
Ask help from this guy who is scared of the old woman?

251
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,447
Is he really that good?

252
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:49,657
Why do you call her that?

253
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,322
Aren't you scared of him?

254
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,197
Will she give you a break
if you stop calling her old woman?

255
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:57,365
Either way, it'll turn out the same.

256
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,072
She is a violent old woman.

257
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:04,240
Isli, how long has he been with our master?

258
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,782
About 80 years,

259
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,115
and he hasn't given in yet.

260
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm really impressed.

261
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,167
Alright.

262
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,240
I'll look into this.

263
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,792
And I'll leave the rest to you.

264
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,782
Okay, your name is Hayato, right?

265
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:28,115
Anyway, let's start the special training now.

266
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,792
Paula, come along, too.

267
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,032
Once Hayato and Prontea make some move,

268
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,072
the demons will notice it.

269
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:40,907
The demons should not be able to defeat Prontea.

270
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:44,457
If only I can catch one of them alive.

271
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:47,197
Emperor Takeshita.

272
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:52,740
On screen 2034, go back for about 4 seconds.

273
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,072
Okay.

274
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:56,197
Bacode, did you find them?

275
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:59,947
Handling large amount of information is my expertise.

276
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:01,197
This is the moment.

277
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:04,947
You and the Emperor should be able to see it.

278
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:06,282
I see.

279
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:08,782
The first one is the boy with glasses.

280
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:12,240
Pisara, go get him.

281
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,457
Got it.

282
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,990
What's with this super weak flame?

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,875
How could it work for me?

284
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:33,832
What's this? Ice?

285
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,292
Explosion Wave!

286
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,197
What the hell are you?

287
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,907
Some old man using magic?

288
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,947
Is this all you got?

289
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:58,157
Or do you still have some tricks up your sleeves?

290
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,740
Either way, it annoys me.

291
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,947
I did use my full strength.

292
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:06,240
But I just learned how to attack with magic.

293
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,157
That should be enough to bring down Isli and Paula.

294
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,292
He's already hard to be defeated
by training with our master.

295
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,447
I rarely have the opportunity to practice that.

296
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:21,667
Stay with me a little longer.

297
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,875
I just said it won't work for me.

298
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,542
What?

299
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,657
My attack doesn't work for him, too?

300
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,167
I get it.

301
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:50,490
Magic combined with ordinary attacks seems to
have auxiliary effects.

302
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,957
I know why Isli brought you to me.

303
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,990
You are strong but you have obvious shortcomings.

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,167
I'll tell you right now.

305
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:07,948
What should I do if I have to
bring down this living creature, Dr. Kajikama?

306
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,916
Well,

307
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,198
according to your proposal,

308
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,698
I think using poison is the quickest way.

309
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,573
How many doses of poison is expected to use?

310
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,031
Well,

311
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,531
tetrodotoxin should work.

312
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,573
Make him eat about 50,000 puffer fish,

313
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,615
and he will probably die.

314
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,281
There must be a better way.

315
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,781
Even with military drug weapons,
it will take tens of minutes to kill him.

316
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:41,281
Anyway, the research results are organized as usual.
Take them.

317
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,990
Here you are.

318
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,615
It's easier after making sure that poison works.

319
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,500
Please carry on with the research.

320
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:56,281
Have you ever heard of Dr. Oobami
when you were in the Zobul Empire?

321
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,750
Oobami?

322
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,740
Of course I do.

323
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,031
The Zobul Empire does all the research
by following that old man's instructions.

324
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:09,416
For example, duplication of certain creature
or reproduction via vitro fertilization.

325
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,281
I see.

326
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,791
He is studying mass production of demons.

327
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,916
Mr. Isli, something is wrong.

328
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,666
Something going on in this warehouse?

329
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,750
Only... in this way can I... be saved.

330
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,083
Even if you're weak, you're still an Idaten.

331
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,031
Idaten runs very fast.

332
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,156
But there's no way out for you.

333
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,115
Let's have fun.

334
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,490
This guy is Pisara, General of the Zobul Army.

335
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,740
Although my raid failed,

336
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,791
you have no place to run within this space.

337
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,416
Darn it, I can't see anything.

338
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,573
That guy can move around even in the dark?

339
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,448
But there's nothing I can do here.

340
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,948
Lucky for me.

341
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:43,125
Let's see how can I escape the attack from the entrance.

342
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,823
It'll be too bad if I can't hit him from here.

343
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,291
It's gonna be harder than I thought.

344
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,531
Why are you so easy on me all of a sudden?

345
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,906
Show me all you got.

346
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,740
Otherwise, it won't work for me at all.

347
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,323
It's not working.

348
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,916
But I attacked with almost the same strength as you.

349
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,281
What?

350
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,156
This is your weakness.

351
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,125
That is to say...

352
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,740
Have we squashed them?

353
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,000
They are weaker than the Demon Lord described.

354
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,865
We have drawn the demons' attention.

355
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,615
The training will continue after we defeat them.

356
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,958
Is that okay, Hayato?

357
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,115
Okay.

358
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,240
Darn it.

359
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,083
This guy is such a horrible monster.

360
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,708
What?

361
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,083
It's not working.

362
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,490
Magic doesn't work for demons.

363
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,531
This guy is quite strong.

364
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,041
As for him...

365
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,115
Paula, Hayato,

366
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,698
this guy is yours.

367
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,041
Knock him down.

368
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,740
Ouch.

369
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,781
Each group

370
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,444

372
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,406
Let's get started.
