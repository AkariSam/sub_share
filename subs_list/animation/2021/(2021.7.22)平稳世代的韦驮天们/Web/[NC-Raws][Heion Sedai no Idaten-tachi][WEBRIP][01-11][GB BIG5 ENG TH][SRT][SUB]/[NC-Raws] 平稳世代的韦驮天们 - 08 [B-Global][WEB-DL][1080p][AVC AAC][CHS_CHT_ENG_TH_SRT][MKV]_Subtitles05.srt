1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:13,166
Why is Zobul's Emperor here?

2
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,417
Why do you come to us?

3
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,792
No, what do you intend to do?

4
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:22,332
He is a deity.

5
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:23,542
Deity.

6
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,125
Ouch!

7
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,957
You're stronger than I thought.

8
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:54,207
I get tired quicker now because of my age.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,042
Whatever. Show me what you got.

10
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,875
Or do you want to run to your friends and cry?

11
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,832
No one is running away, bastard.

12
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,542
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

13
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,917
The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace

14
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,292
What a drag.

15
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,167
This should work.

16
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,167
Seriously? Attack this way?

17
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,792
Come on!

18
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,500
I can't believe this.

19
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,000
Anyway, I knew I can't win.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,375
Do whatever you want.

21
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:05,375
What are these strings?

22
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,957
I just realize these strings are on them.

23
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:14,042
Is someone out there controlling these people?

24
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,667
Correct!

25
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,957
They are my puppets.

26
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:22,332
You have to fight them forever before you defeat me.

27
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:23,875
Here you are!

28
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,250
My face...

29
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,917
I got you!

30
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,917
You fool.

31
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,000
How dare you!

32
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:39,500
What happened?

33
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,750
My hand is chopped off.

34
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,457
I can't believe the simple trap worked.

35
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe I can actually win.

36
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:56,402
I still need to look for bald Bacode,
the fat woman, and the girl with bunches.

37
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,707
Prontea converts what he sees into electronic signals,

38
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,000
which are sent through his computer

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to General Pisara.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,292
Nope...

41
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,542
- I feel like I'm a factory QC. - Nope...

42
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,166
Just shut up and look for them.

43
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,208
How many have you found that look like Miku?

44
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,708
Just one.

45
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,541
(MIKU)
It's hard to believe that someone looks like this.

46
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,583
So...

47
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,708
Who is she? She's so much like her.

48
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,791
A substitute?

49
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,916
Yeah, but why?

50
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,458
Okay, I'll go and ask her.

51
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,875
Let's go.

52
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,125
What do you want!

53
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:53,583
Shut up. I don't hurt humans. Just be quiet.

54
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,875
Let's get out of here.

55
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,583
No, I...

56
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,500
I'll be here until the end.

57
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,000
Old man.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,041
Can't you extend your tentacles?

59
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,416
Or transform?

60
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,083
He recovers so fast.

61
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,666
That's not good for me.

62
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:28,166
(Episode 8 Idaten)
No, I'm good at fighting with bare hands.

63
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,833
No trick or scheme is exactly what you want, right?

64
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,625
Right.

65
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,166
Watch this.

66
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:40,250
He's fast and recovers quickly.
The longer we fight, the bigger chance I may lose.

67
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,666
So naive.

68
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,666
If you didn't show up,

69
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,833
nothing will happen.

70
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,333
Stop joking.

71
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,541
I can kill you on my own.

72
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,416
By the way, old man.

73
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,750
Don't you want to take your hands back?

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This hurts so bad.

75
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,375
He's so seriously injured,
but is pain the only thing he felt?

76
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,541
We should get it over with.

77
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,541
I agree.

78
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,041
This should be the end...

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,875
What? Are you dead?

80
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,333
Come and hit me again.

81
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,333
She looks like she's about to die.

82
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,125
Am I winning?

83
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,333
What a drag!

84
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:41,875
This cowardly trick has made me super mad.

85
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,666
What? What's going on?

86
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,625
She recovers so fast!

87
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,291
If you are caught in the strings,

88
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,000
you'll be trapped inside.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,250
Really? Let's make it tighter then.

90
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,625
Damn. I have to cut off my hair...

91
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,750
So, everyone is here.

92
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,458
It's my turn!

93
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,041
This is too much.

94
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,833
Are you the only one left?

95
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,833
So, you're the real manipulator.

96
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,125
You... can't stand up?

97
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,875
I won.

98
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,791
How could he not kill me?

99
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,541
It seems all he cares is winning.

100
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,541
Get ready to launch the missiles.

101
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:06,250
Even if it succeeds, we may still be wiped out.

102
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:14,500
Demon Lord,
I asked my kids to run away without your approval.

103
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,750
It's not... over yet.

104
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,583
What are you doing?

105
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,875
What kind of question is this?

106
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:36,332
You'll die without treatment.

107
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:40,582
You're stubbornly nice.

108
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:44,207
It won't work. I weigh over 500 kilos.

109
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:46,792
Ouch...

110
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,542
Leave me alone. Just run.

111
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:53,542
It's not bad for me to see a young girl's nude before death.

112
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,000
Stop it.

113
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,792
I like that.

114
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,289
You're like my wife. 20 years after marriage,

115
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,207
if we have sex with the lights on, she would still get mad.

116
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:06,582
It's fun that women are shy.

117
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,332
Girls like Miku are not my type.

118
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,707
Emperor Takeshita...

119
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:15,917
You didn't get us into the war,

120
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,582
or take us as hostages.

121
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:23,125
Even now, you still wish I could run away.

122
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,042
I think...

123
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,667
you're not a bad guy.

124
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,375
Damn... I'm still not recovered.

125
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,792
What's that?

126
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,707
Emperor Takeshita.

127
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:47,832
This is my last advice.

128
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:50,167
I think you've realized that

129
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,332
I'm not a human being.

130
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:55,082
I can never understand human beings.

131
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,167
In all cases,

132
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,375
I can't stop hunting humans.

133
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,207
If you don't want to get caught again,

134
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,207
run to Hotayena.

135
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:08,042
If so, before you die,

136
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,167
you can live a peaceful life.

137
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,125
What are you talking about?

138
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,792
Even if you're not a human,

139
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,957
you have a human appearance and human mind.

140
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:19,457
How come you can't understand us?

141
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:28,417
I'm so useless.

142
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,792
When I was assaulted,

143
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,375
captured, and imprisoned,

144
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,082
I could do nothing but pray.

145
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:45,292
Deities came to save us regardless of the injuries.

146
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,125
She misunderstood.

147
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:51,042
But I can't even carry the injured man.

148
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,875
Praying is so useless.

149
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,000
I want power.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,625
I want the power to protect everyone.

151
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,375
I also want... the power deities have.

152
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:14,542
There are three conditions to make Idatens:

153
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,917
the thoughts of a number of creatures,

154
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,250
a long period of time,

155
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,792
and desire for salvation.

156
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,500
Now, the Zobul Empire

157
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,375
has met these three conditions.

158
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,500
The Idatens that were born

159
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,207
will have their appearance, gender, name and character

160
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:39,292
the same as the one who prays with the strongest desire
when the conditions are met.

161
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,667
Where are you from?

162
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,917
Are you okay?

163
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,125
You seem wounded.

164
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,000
Really? You were watching the whole time?

165
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,292
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
I have no idea.

166
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,582
Ouch... my body...

167
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,542
No!

168
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,667
What's that?

169
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,417
The fast flying speed... Is she...

170
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:13,066
Before killing you, I have a question.

171
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:16,417
Where is Demon Lord Over-M?

172
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:20,082
Or are you him?

173
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:21,832
Demon Lord Over-M?

174
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,292
How could I know where he is!

175
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:28,125
You've lived for 800 years and you don't know his identity.
What's the point...

176
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,082
It's true I don't know, but he reminds me of something.

177
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:34,832
The way he names things is like my grandpa.

178
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:37,792
If it's something hard, it's called super-K.

179
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:42,000
If it's weak, looks like a cow and can be eaten by demons,

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,792
it's called Minotaurs.

181
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:48,332
It's a practical low-level demon,

182
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:53,000
which can be eaten like beef at any time.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,332
How about calling it Minotaurs?

184
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:59,332
It's not bad...

185
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:02,000
Coincidence?

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,207
Interesting discussion.

187
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:07,917
May I join you guys?

188
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,917
Who is it? Demon...

189
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,167
It's better to stay quiet.

190
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:18,500
Rin, after watching your battles, I remember something.

191
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,625
So, I'm here to talk about it.

192
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:24,417
Why do you know my name?

193
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:27,667
That sword is the same as Sukis'.

194
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,917
How can I let you fight? You are so clumsy
and only know how to run away.

195
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,082
If you insist,

196
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,292
practice slashing it every day.

197
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,250
Sukis.

198
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,125
Stop underestimating me.

199
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,082
One day...

200
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:50,792
How... do you know...

201
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:57,582
As I remember, you were weak and cried a lot.

202
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:07,875
Grandpa and everyone.

203
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,875
If you're not here, I...

204
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,167
I can only, only...

205
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,917
Who are you?

206
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,207
How do you know all these?

207
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,042
Well, I don't know either.

208
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,542
But, I just remember a lot of things.

209
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:26,125
For example, you're more afraid of being alone

210
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,500
than the demons.

211
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,332
That's why you'd rather go to the battles.

212
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,250
No, I want to go with you.

213
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:40,417
Why... this guy...

214
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,207
She stopped.

215
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:44,375
There are weak points all over her.

216
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,832
Based on previous battles,

217
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:48,750
I found a way to defeat her.

218
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,082
But, I only have one chance.

219
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:52,457
I told you already.

220
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:57,750
I really don't know where Miku goes.

221
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,750
What do you think?

222
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,667
Anyway,

223
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:04,167
she must have run away.

224
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,667
Even if we ask other demons, they won't know.

225
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,625
So...

226
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,207
she escaped.

227
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:13,542
What a drag.

228
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:17,500
I see why General Pisara is most careful with her.

229
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,667
She is right.

230
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,417
I found Bilov and Bacode.

231
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:26,875
General Nepto. Why do you do this?

232
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,875
Shut up!

233
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,042
You'll be just like me even against your will.

234
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:35,292
Okay. Hand Bacode to Prontea.

235
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:38,292
Then explain to Bilov about the situation

236
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,792
and take him to a safe place.

237
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,000
Roger that.

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,792
Nepto, what are you up to!

239
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,500
What do you want?

240
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,125
At some point,

241
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,332
you have to create a new country for everyone.

242
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,167
Even Hayato is back here.

243
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,792
Did something happen?

244
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,625
Sorry for making you wait.

245
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,707
Here you go. It's Bacode.

246
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:06,707
Hayato is coming back.

247
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,500
Do you know what happened?

248
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,457
Nope.

249
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:12,875
I thought he would not come back even if he's dying.

250
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,847
Where is he now?

251
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,375
Over here.

252
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,292
So slow.

253
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,207
Can you be faster?

254
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:22,417
That's the best I can do.

255
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,167
I've never walked on the sea...

256
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:28,375
What?

257
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,875
He's our friend.

258
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,167
I see. It's the new Idaten.

259
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,417
Idaten?

260
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:38,000
Right. Zobul has met the conditions.

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,667
I need to perform the operation.

262
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,250
Paula, I'll leave this to you.

263
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,417
Alright.

264
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,957
Hayato. It seems like a tough battle.

265
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,332
Was the opponent Umeyo or the Emperor?

266
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,292
Emperor, I guess.

267
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,219
Did you lose?

268
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,000
Shut up! I won!

269
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,917
I'll come back once she's settled. Just stay tuned.

270
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:57,957
Awesome.

271
00:16:57,957 --> 00:16:59,582
The new Idaten, what's your name?

272
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,207
I'm... Gil. I'm Gil.

273
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,291
Gil, nice to meet you.

274
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,166
I'm Prontea.

275
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,041
Now we're in the critical period of the war.

276
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,458
After it finishes, let's talk.

277
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,458
Has everyone escaped?

278
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,333
Who are you?

279
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,541
When did you stand behind me?

280
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,916
That's my line.

281
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,083
You can teleport?

282
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,916
Are you Gil?

283
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,333
Yeah, I'm Gil Tina.

284
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,541
People call me Gil.

285
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,583
How do you know my name?

286
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,250
A human with the same appearance.

287
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,125
Coincidence?

288
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,666
Are you a deity, too?

289
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:04,166
I see. You met Hayato.

290
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,708
I'm a deity just like him.

291
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,916
You're just a human, but an interesting one.

292
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,583
What have you done...

293
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,708
You're the new sample of summoning rules for Idatens.

294
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,833
Look what you have done.

295
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,625
He's a demon.

296
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,791
If he was not dead, you would be.

297
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:30,067
But... you took someone's life so easily.

298
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,208
If I was weaker,

299
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,250
and had a hard time killing him,

300
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,375
would you blame me, too?

301
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:45,041
What can I do to make you satisfied?

302
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,583
I don't know.

303
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,458
I might be dead if you didn't kill him.

304
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,333
But...

305
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,416
taking someone's life like this,

306
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,250
I can't accept it.

307
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,375
She's an interesting human,

308
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,708
but is kind of a drag.

309
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,958
What should I do?

310
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,625
Right now,

311
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,333
a lot of people can't escape because of injuries.

312
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,083
I can't save everyone on my own.

313
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,833
Deities, please send me power...

314
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,333
Sleep until everything is done.

315
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:25,916
No wars can be so ideal.

316
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,875
You'd better not know it.

317
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,541
He doesn't remember it clearly,

318
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,833
and doesn't look like him.

319
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,250
But he knows things only my grandpa knows.

320
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,208
Some of his habits are just like his.

321
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,458
Are you... my grandpa?

322
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,500
She's good at attacking,

323
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,333
but not defending.

324
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,861
So, with the help of her power,

325
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,375
I can easily chop off her arms.

326
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,625
She would have to take everything she attacks with.

327
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,875
Take your own attack!

328
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,541
So powerful!

329
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,416
Even Demon Lord is affected!

330
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,208
But he's a robot, he should be fine.

331
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,625
Whatever. I just need one more strike,

332
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,416
and she will turn to ashes...

333
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,041
Gran... Grandpa.

334
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,708
I...

335
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:45,000
always hope to see you again...

336
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,250
Master...

337
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,083
Six hours after Takeshita and Brandy are defeated,

338
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,250
Pisara and Kori led the armies to join in the war.

339
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,625
Hayato is also back.

340
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,125
Bacode is in the control room, replacing Pisara.

341
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,125
He needs to find the remaining demons.

342
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,208
After Prontea's and Hayato's efforts,

343
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,500
the war is put to an end.

344
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,583
We have to start everything all over again.
