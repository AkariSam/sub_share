1
00:00:02,686 --> 00:00:06,713
I'm Sasami Kawai, your average,
happy fourth grader.

2
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:10,091
One day, a strange lady with
magical powers came.

3
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:14,421
I want you to be "Pretty Sammy,"
a magical girl...

4
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:17,228
...and I want you to restore
world peace.

5
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:21,402
Unbelievable!
Of course I said "no"!

6
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:25,136
But Pixy Misa showed up
with her black magic.

7
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:29,202
She challenged me to fight and
a weird monster attacked me!

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,877
Really, who knows
what'll happen next...?

9
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:38,377
Test! Test! Test!

10
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,555
It's unreal!

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,021
Listen! I've got big news!

12
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:47,660
You won't believe it!

13
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:49,790
- A magical...
-...girl?

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,669
Yeah, Pretty Sammy. Her outfit's
a little lame, but still.

15
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:59,267
She totally creamed this freaky
monster with her magic!

16
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:03,541
Magic beams flew out of
her baton! Zap! Zap!

17
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,047
Really, Majima?

18
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:08,642
But magic only exists in
video games, right?

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,244
It's real, isn't it, Kenji?

20
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,290
Yeah, and the miniskirt
is her charming point.

21
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,953
I don't believe it.

22
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,995
But if Oyamada says it's true...

23
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,221
What's that supposed to mean?

24
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:24,199
You can't trust me?

25
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:29,465
I wonder if magical girls do exist.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,403
Yeah, I wonder.
I wouldn't know.

27
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,681
I'm so embarrassed, I can't
let them know it was me.

28
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:42,412
I have to keep it a secret,
no matter what!

29
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:46,113
You'd be able to do anything
if you had magic.

30
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,588
Huh? Y-yeah...

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,523
It'd be great...

32
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:54,430
...having magic.

33
00:01:56,433 --> 00:02:00,369
I came for you
from a magical kingdom.

34
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,533
...from a magical kingdom...

35
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,500
Misao. Misao.

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:11,336
I almost remembered something.
But not quite.

37
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:16,682
And then, Kenji and I helped
Pretty Sammy do her training!

38
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:21,190
Cut it out. I hate when you talk
about other girls, Hiroto!

39
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:24,022
What?! Get away
from me, you freak!

40
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:26,153
Having a fight with your wife?

41
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,696
Not funny.

42
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:30,355
You're blushing, Hiroto.

43
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:31,696
Am not!

44
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:35,966
Excuse me, but I would like
to start the class.

45
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:38,365
Yes!

46
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,813
All right! It's perfect!

47
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:49,249
Morning, my beloved wife Honoka
whom I love to pieces!

48
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:53,222
What are you talking about,
Ginji? It's afternoon.

49
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,385
Already?

50
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:58,928
Huh?

51
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:02,022
What's with this rabbit?
Reminds me of a cat.

52
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:07,399
It's been hanging around the
house lately. Isn't it cute?

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,940
Those eyes.

54
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,603
Some animals suck up to people.

55
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:23,653
I love them!

56
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:28,288
It's become quite attached
to Sasami. Let's keep it.

57
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:32,861
Good idea. I can't wait to see
Sasami's happy face!

58
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,433
Oh, right. Sasami's going to
bring her test home tonight.

59
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,599
Her test? I can't wait!

60
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,809
Does everyone have their test back?

61
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:48,674
Yes.

62
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,839
Okay, I have something to say.

63
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:56,909
Two special students in our class
got 100% on this hard test.

64
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:01,515
And they are Oyamada and Misao!

65
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,427
Unreal, Misao!

66
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:06,257
Just lucky.

67
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,354
Stand up, you two.

68
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:09,866
Yes.

69
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,901
You too, Misao.

70
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,997
Let's give a big hand
to these good students.

71
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,948
Umi no Hoshi
Elementary School

72
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,117
This is great, Misao.

73
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:30,112
Put it away, already.

74
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,984
Why?

75
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:37,292
Look, lady! Misao got 100%.
Isn't that great?

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,987
Hey! Sasami!

77
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:45,865
Oh, yeah. The "Dragon S"
magazine goes on sale today.

78
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:48,200
Come with me, Misao.

79
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,664
That Pretty Sammy!

80
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:55,171
Being so carefree!
How infuriating!

81
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,213
Especially considering that
I created Pixy Misa!

82
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,582
I messed up.

83
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:01,415
She finished off the Love-love
Monster pretty easily too.

84
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,046
That's your fault!

85
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,679
Okay!

86
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:10,993
This isn't funny! Gemini will be
restored to its former balance.

87
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,563
Then Tsunami will be
finalized as queen!

88
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:18,023
Ah! I just imagined Tsunami
becoming the queen!

89
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:21,127
I despise turning into someone
who could think such a thought!

90
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,008
You've got to interfere
somehow, Rumiya.

91
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,168
Okay?

92
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,873
But if the Juraihelm priests
find out...!

93
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:33,581
No problem.

94
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,483
Even if they do find out, it
won't be me they'll be after.

95
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,021
But, Sis!

96
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,150
We'd better not.

97
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:48,220
Quit your griping and
get down there!

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,628
I hate you-u-u!

99
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,841
Mom! I got my test back
in school today!

100
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:07,142
Where've you been, Misao?
You're late for prep class.

101
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:10,277
Sorry. Sasami and I
stopped along the way.

102
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:13,220
Just hurry and get ready.
Then get to class.

103
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,692
I have to go back to work.
I'm going.

104
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,853
Um...

105
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,228
Don't forget to lock the door.

106
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:34,703
But I did so well...

107
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,184
A bird.

108
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:52,555
Sasami.

109
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:57,030
Forget it. I'm not doing any
of that magic stuff anymore.

110
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,559
I'm not talking about that, Sasami.

111
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,298
Then what?

112
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:05,739
Your family's going to keep me!

113
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,705
Mom!

114
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:12,010
Mom!

115
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:13,481
What're you thinking?!

116
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,019
Welcome back, Sasami!

117
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,218
Sasami's test has arrived!

118
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,190
I wonder how she did!

119
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,523
We can't wait!

120
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,262
I am a righteous magical girl.

121
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:38,205
I can do anything; I'm magic.

122
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,833
And they call me,
and they call me...

123
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,412
Pixy Misa.

124
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:53,018
I spin around my magic cane...

125
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:56,525
...and anytime is
a magical show time.

126
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,591
I'll give my rival Sammy
something to whine about.

127
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,366
Victory

128
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,960
I'll show her! And I'll win!
"You win!"

129
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:10,129
I am a righteous magical girl.

130
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:13,175
I can do anything; I'm magic.

131
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,872
And they call me,
and they call me...

132
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:20,146
Pixy Misa!

133
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,712
What is this?!

134
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:27,782
Today's magical target!

135
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,121
"Success Preparatory School"? Why?

136
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:31,751
Just feels right.

137
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,660
Sixty percent, huh.

138
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,729
Sixty percent.

139
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,145
Good job, Sasami!

140
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,711
I would have gotten 70%,
myself, though.

141
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,044
You're so cool, Ginji!

142
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:54,776
Not bad.

143
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:58,378
Sasami, study hard and
do as well as your dad.

144
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,422
Yes, Mom.

145
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,353
All right, Sasami.
Time for my present!

146
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,350
A present?!

147
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:08,056
You can go to free trial
classes, if you do it now.

148
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,296
Is this a prep school?

149
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,426
Yes. The "Success Preparatory School."

150
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,737
That's the same one Misao goes to.

151
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,829
Really?

152
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:20,603
If you try your best,
I'll make sukiyaki for dinner!

153
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:21,701
Sukiyaki?!

154
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:24,508
- It's settled!
- Sukiyaki!

155
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,344
- Let's go, Sasami!
- Roger!

156
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:32,411
Ready, Sasami?

157
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,683
Okay, Dad.

158
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,687
Let's go!

159
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,059
Hello, all you hard working
boys and girls.

160
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,697
Who are you?!

161
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,791
Me?

162
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,962
I'm the substitute teacher.

163
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,305
I'm Magical Girl Pixy Misa!

164
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,108
Nice to meet you.

165
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,145
Magical girl?

166
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:57,770
That's right.

167
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,874
Could you stop talking
and start teaching?

168
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,820
No, no, no.
A long time ago someone said...

169
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,687
"Play a lot, and study a lot."

170
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:14,025
You study all day at school;
you don't need to study here too.

171
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:18,924
We came here to study,
so go and get our teacher!

172
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,571
What? Hey, what are you doing?

173
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,403
What?

174
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:33,113
How come this is hidden
in your desk? Why...?

175
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,581
Everyone wants to play
and have fun, right?

176
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:39,212
Well, uh...

177
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:41,723
Everyone should have fun.

178
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
Holding back is no good
for your health.

179
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,354
Come on, Love-love Monster!

180
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:51,523
Calling Mystics!

181
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,776
Okay, everyone! Let's have fun
and read comics!

182
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,252
You're the best, Comic Girl!

183
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,788
Look what I can do!

184
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,257
Huh? Don't you think
that's funny?

185
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:24,424
You study so much,
you can't even tell what's funny.

186
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,765
Aha! Comic Girl.

187
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:30,397
Do something hilarious
for these studious kids.

188
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,002
Okay, here goes.

189
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,404
Classroom 3.

190
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,942
This is it.

191
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:41,279
This is Misao's class, too.

192
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:42,340
Perfect.

193
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:44,610
Hello!

194
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:53,261
Wonder what kind of comic
he turned into.

195
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,762
Where am I?

196
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:56,264
He-ey!
Get me outta here!

197
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,765
Oops!

198
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:58,926
Ouch!

199
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,326
Hilarious!

200
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:06,432
Time to edit the color part
ofthe comic book!

201
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,345
Let's go home, Dad.

202
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:14,850
What for? It looks like fun.
Go on in, Sasami.

203
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:19,582
But, Dad!

204
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,351
I'll be waiting outside.

205
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:26,319
Well, if it isn't Sasami. Good
timing, and nice to meet you.

206
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,160
Miss Kawai! Is this a friend of yours?!

207
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:33,301
Not at all!
I've never seen her before.

208
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,167
Think a magical girl who fights
for justice should be lying?

209
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:40,333
Oh, well. Comic Girl!

210
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,878
Start the main event!

211
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:47,474
Sure! Everyone come and join me!

212
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:52,447
Get me out!

213
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,682
Thud!

214
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:54,950
Aarg!

215
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,218
Help!

216
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:02,488
That's funny! Oh, my stomach!

217
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:12,131
Why is a Love-love Monster
in a prep school?

218
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,336
Sasami!

219
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,843
What?

220
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:20,508
Only you can stop this Love-love
Monster's rampage, Sasami.

221
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,551
You know that, right?

222
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,654
Yeah, but...

223
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,957
If you don't, the class
will be turned into a comic!

224
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,357
Come on.

225
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:33,088
Okay.

226
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,288
I'll do my best.

227
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,425
Pretty Mutation...

228
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:43,105
...Magical Recall!

229
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,247
Pretty Sammy is here!

230
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,980
Let me go!

231
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,524
Stop that!

232
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,425
Help, Hiroto! He doesn't come
to prep school, though.

233
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,122
What? Who's that?

234
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,130
Count on me when it comes to
magic problems!

235
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,964
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

236
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:16,096
Even if you don't call,
I'll come to the rescue!

237
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,566
You've come, Pretty Sammy.

238
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,241
Change everybody back, Misa!

239
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:27,515
Don't expect me to agree so
easily; it's not that simple.

240
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,511
Comic Girl! Show Sammy
something to remember!

241
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,021
Sure! Look at this!

242
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:39,718
You can't let her hit you
with that light!

243
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,830
She's too fast!
Go to plan 2, Comic Girl!

244
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,492
Okay! Here comes a really big comic!

245
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,845
I can't breathe!!

246
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,149
What a wonderful melody!

247
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:05,612
Comic Girl, hit her
with the final blow!

248
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,815
Here comes the final blow!

249
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,584
Stay away!

250
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,026
Sammy!

251
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:16,190
I never should've become
a magical girl.

252
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,967
Here I come!

253
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,206
What are you doing?!

254
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:27,704
That was close!

255
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:30,507
Time for the Pretty Space!

256
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,706
Right!

257
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,205
This is the same as last week.

258
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,271
Pretty Sammy!

259
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:02,834
Go back home and reflect on
what you've done, monsters!

260
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:06,774
How tragic. We must part,
Comic Girl.

261
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,250
Farewell. Farewell. Good-bye!

262
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,186
Misa! That's not fair!

263
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,286
Converge, magic powers of justice!

264
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:26,702
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

265
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,676
It's okay to study,
but sometimes...

266
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,943
...read comics and watch
cartoons for a change!!

267
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:43,682
No wonder this place is so
trendy. Great class.

268
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,015
Oh, well.

269
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:49,484
You did it, Sammy!

270
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,753
I sure did.

271
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,294
I can't believe
magical girls exist.

272
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,624
Thanks for helping me.

273
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,667
I did it because you helped us.
I don't like owing favors.

274
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:03,204
Well, thanks, Konoha.

275
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,240
How do you know my name?

276
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,301
Uh...be seeing you!

277
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,438
Bye!

278
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:21,856
Sasami?

279
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,656
What are you doing here?

280
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:25,819
Misao.

281
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:28,591
Did you join this prep school?

282
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:33,124
Just taking a trial class.
I thought I'd surprise you, but...

283
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,829
But?

284
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:38,263
There were some complications.
See for yourself.

285
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:47,240
Gemini's balance has been
restored, slightly.

286
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:50,349
Thank you, Pretty Sammy.

287
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,215
I messed up again.

288
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:57,157
Have you said your good-byes?

289
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,125
Ready when you are.

290
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,410
Have fun in class, Sasami?

291
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,654
Well, I did my best...

292
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:30,784
Oh, guess what, Dad! Misao got
100% on her test! Great, huh?!

293
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,352
It is!
We'd better celebrate.

294
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,857
Let's see...

295
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:37,695
No...

296
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:40,099
Congratulations! Congratulations!

297
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,098
Would you like to come over
for dinner, Misao?

298
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:48,368
Good idea! Okay, Misao?

299
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:53,313
We'll stop and buy
what we need for sukiyaki.

300
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,349
Woohoo!

301
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:58,251
Sukiyaki! A party!
Sukiyaki! A party!

302
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,959
Thank you, Sasami.

303
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,629
Do it with us, Misao!

304
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,693
Yeah, kids should have fun!
All together!

305
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:18,206
Sukiyaki! A party!
Sukiyaki! A party!

306
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:24,139
Sukiyaki.

307
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:36,591
Once again, the girl you're watching...

308
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:41,919
...isn't the real me.

309
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,836
It's a girl...

310
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:51,339
...that was made up...

311
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:57,835
...for you and for our love.

312
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:05,879
You like my honesty.

313
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:11,454
That's what you say...

314
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,791
...but it's an illusion.

315
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:18,727
Deceiving others is a way of life.

316
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,865
It's a woman's romance.

317
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:26,341
I love you more than anyone.

318
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:30,209
I want to show you
a wonderful dream.

319
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:33,612
I love you so much.

320
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,474
I'm going to keep deceiving you.

321
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,217
I'll make you happier...

322
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:48,052
...than any other guy in the world.

323
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:58,871
The invincible Pretty Sammy
has one weak spot;...

324
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,909
...jumping over the vaulting box.

325
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,607
At this rate my grade for gym
will be an "F"!

326
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,845
Coming next:
Jump Over The Top!

327
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,612
Call Sammy
when you're in trouble!
