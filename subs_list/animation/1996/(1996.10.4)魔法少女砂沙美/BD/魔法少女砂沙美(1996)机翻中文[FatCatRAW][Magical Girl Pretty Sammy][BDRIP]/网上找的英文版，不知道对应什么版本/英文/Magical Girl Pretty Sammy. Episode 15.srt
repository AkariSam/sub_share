...yume janai.

18
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:38,084
Grade 4, Division 3. Listen up.
"Science Lab"

19
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:40,888
This class is not about simple
science, it's about chemistry!

20
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,895
Magnificent applied science...

21
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:46,364
...which mankind counts on for
its future and for peace!

22
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:50,199
And so, we'll mix a 1-to-3 part
mixture of a mysterious chemical...

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,831
...and hydrochloric acid.
And mix that with glycerin.

24
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:58,902
Who'll do this magnificent experiment?
Sasami! Let's get you to do it.

25
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,879
Huh?! Why me?!

26
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:04,714
You've gotta do this, or it
won't work! It's gotta be you!

27
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:07,982
So come and do it! Hurry, now!
Chop, chop! Come on!

28
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:10,750
Are you sure?
I'm really gonna do it.

29
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:13,022
Yeah, yeah. Just hurry and do it.

30
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,061
Do it! Go for it!

31
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,221
Okay, I'll do it!

32
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,393
Here goes...

33
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:26,734
Jesus!

34
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,238
All right! All right!

35
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:38,875
Baby Sammy

36
00:02:42,022 --> 00:02:45,822
Oh, my, Sasami. You sure
have made a mess of the lab!

37
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,918
But I only did what you asked!!

38
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:51,954
Oh, well. It can't be helped.
Mistakes happen in experiments.

39
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,966
Are you blaming me?!

40
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:59,470
Professor! I think Kawai
should be severely punished!

41
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,973
You're the lowest of human kind!

42
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,477
Oh, Hiroto!
You're embarrassing me!

43
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:07,446
Anyway, she should be punished!

44
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:11,781
Yes, perhaps I'll get her to clean
up by herself, after school.

45
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:14,218
But it wasn't my fault,
I tell you!

46
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,384
Um, Professor?

47
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,750
Could I stay and help her?

48
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:19,951
Misao!

49
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:21,995
We'll clean up together, Sasami.

50
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:23,230
A wonderful friendship

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,766
But it wasn't my fault.

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,400
- Can't do it!
- Oh! Our friendship!

53
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,402
Clean up by yourself, Sasami!
Do it yourself!

54
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,030
Do it alone! You should,
you would, you will, you must!

55
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,903
Got it?!

56
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,802
But it wasn't my fault!

57
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:45,510
Oh, how did I get myself
into this mess?!

58
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:48,020
It wasn't my fault!

59
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:50,022
What a drag... Huh?

60
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,925
Oh, the medicine I worked
so hard to create...!

61
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:58,760
Then SOMEBODY blew up the
medicine and lab equipment.

62
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:02,969
Now I won't be able to test
the medicine's effectiveness...!

63
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:05,834
And this is what it'll cost for
the lab equipment, to boot!

64
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:11,210
Oh, what a predicament! Why did
this accident have to happen?!

65
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,512
- Hey, Miss Kawai!
- Oh, hi!

66
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:18,779
Listen, I've got a small favor
to ask you, Miss Kawai.

67
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:22,714
I feel like I'm being
led into a trap...

68
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:27,325
This is a growth accelerator,
so to speak.

69
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:30,727
But, you know what? I couldn't
do my experiments on it...

70
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:32,731
...thanks to SOMEBODY.

71
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,561
Uh-huh...

72
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:38,298
So I'd like you to try drinking
some of this stuff.

73
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,133
B-But that accident was really your...

74
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,200
What are you saying?! That again?
You got more to say?!

75
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:45,642
Yeah, well...

76
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,612
Just take a look at this bill.

77
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:50,912
Wow! A kid can't even imagine
a figure that high!

78
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:54,181
Oh, who can I give this bill to?

79
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:57,746
What, oh, whatever
shall I do...?!!

80
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,021
Okay, Professor. I'll drink...

81
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,858
...my medicine?! You'll quaff
the whole thing back?

82
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,893
We'll just be talking in
circles unless I do...

83
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:10,102
Way to go, the heroine,
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

84
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,762
- Huh?
- Oops.

85
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:15,365
Way to go, 10-year-old, excellent
grade 4 student Sasami Kawai!

86
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:17,303
The heroine's in trouble!!

87
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:19,436
Okay, spread your feet apart.

88
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:21,538
Hand on your hips. Good.

89
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:24,083
All right, slug it all back
when I give the signal.

90
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:25,140
Yes...

91
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:28,153
The future of mankind
rests on this experiment!

92
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,214
Okay, now! Drink it up!

93
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,885
I hope I'll live
through this, somehow!

94
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,763
All the way! All the way!
All the way!

95
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,468
Well? What did you think?

96
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:45,604
Tasted better than I expected!

97
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:47,640
That's not what I meant!

98
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:50,640
Ooh!

99
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:51,733
Ooh!

100
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:54,704
This is great! This is
too much, Sasami!

101
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,125
All right! I've done it!

102
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:08,627
You're quite the adult, Sasami!

103
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:09,662
What?!

104
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,063
What's happened to me?!

105
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:16,068
Ooh, the data's just rolling in!

106
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:18,297
I've figured out one thing!
I know the secret!

107
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:20,339
I really grew up!!

108
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:26,438
So this is the grown-up Sasami.
Not bad at all.

109
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:29,782
Just a second. If I go
home like this...

110
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,272
I'm home!

111
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:32,818
Hi, Sasami.

112
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,948
Who are you?!! You look like
Sasami, but you're not!!

113
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,150
I can't go home like this!

114
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,719
Professor! You've gotta
do something!

115
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:46,493
I'll look after you,
if it comes to that.

116
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:49,160
I'll pass! No thanks!
No way! No how!!

117
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,360
Huh...?

118
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,169
I'm back!

119
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:01,078
- Relax, fans that like kids!
- She's back! It happened too fast!

120
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:04,117
- Too bad, if you liked me as an adult.
- I didn't get all my data!

121
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:07,312
The advancement of science
has been impeded!

122
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,689
And now, while I have the chance...

123
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:12,190
Sasami! Drink it up, again.

124
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:14,887
Please! Let me go!!

125
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,200
Boy, what a shocker!

126
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:23,998
I think that teacher's
got it in for you.

127
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,198
I don't think so. At least
I don't wanna think so!

128
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:31,543
But I wish you could've seen
me as a grown-up, Ryo-Ohki!

129
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,306
No, thanks.

130
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,143
What do you mean by that?!

131
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,682
- One more punch!
- No! Stop it!

132
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,184
How dare you?! Sheesh!

133
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:48,390
Is it morning already?

134
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:51,457
Sasami! Wake up! It's morning!

135
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:53,799
In a minute.

136
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,131
Wake up, or I'll tickle your feet!

137
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,267
Your legs are gone!!!

138
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,705
Ryo-Ohki, you're noisy!

139
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,238
My fingies!

140
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:07,370
My tootsies, too!

141
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:10,280
Ryo-Ohki, did you get big?

142
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,513
No. It's more like you...

143
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,055
Huh?

144
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,820
Goo-Goo!

145
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:21,656
Oh!

146
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:25,289
Sasami! You're full of energy,
first thing this morning!

147
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:29,123
Goo-Goo! Breakfast is ready!
Come on down!

148
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,100
That's easier said than done.

149
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:35,038
How come I've turned into a baby?

150
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:38,500
Hm. I thought maybe it was
a human peculiarity...

151
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:41,069
There's no human like that!!

152
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:45,112
Oh, yeah. Professor Washu made
you take some medicine yesterday.

153
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,316
Maybe that's it.

154
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,014
Uh-oh!

155
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:50,955
What do I do now?

156
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:54,391
I think the only thing you can
do is talk to the professor.

157
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:58,357
Gotta make sure Mommy
doesn't see me go outsie.

158
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,663
I'm so busy! Morning has arrived!
No time to dawdle, gotta look alive...

159
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,295
Now! Make a break for it!

160
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:06,362
Oh! Sasami! What about breakfast?

161
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:09,636
N-No thanks! I'm in a hurry!
Don't need breakfast!

162
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,008
Oh. Have a good day!
Take care!

163
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,671
Now!

164
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,412
Pwoffessa Washu!
Pwoffessa Washu!

165
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,346
She's already left for school.

166
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,388
Bad timing...!

167
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:27,519
Konoha, that experiment yesterday
was something else, huh?

168
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:30,392
And she's supposed to be
a genius scientist...!

169
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,659
What a joke.

170
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,530
Huh?

171
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:45,912
That hairdo looks
just like Kawai's!

172
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:47,607
It does!!

173
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,842
But I must be wrong;
that's just a baby!

174
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,110
Must be...!

175
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,612
We're safe, but that was
sure a close call!

176
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:54,721
Yeah!

177
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,450
Science Lab

178
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,458
Thought so. If the body grows,
so does its power.

179
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,323
Pwoffessa Washu!

180
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,062
The vital relationship between
physical maturity and magic...

181
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:04,360
Pwoffessa Washu!!

182
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,365
Who's there?!

183
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:09,095
Listen! When I'm researching,
I'll have no one...

184
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:12,365
Who was that?
Who called, just now?

185
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,407
Down here!

186
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,408
Huh...?

187
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:24,510
Unbelievable!

188
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:30,815
So that means, the growth
accelerator had a side effect.

189
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,692
Pwease hewp meee!

190
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,728
Sasami...

191
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:37,430
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,431
P-Pwoffessa!

193
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:43,060
You're kinda happy things turned
out like this, aren't you?!

194
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:46,028
Her legs sure look happy!

195
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:49,598
No problem! You'll turn back
to normal in time!

196
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:53,043
I worked on all the ingredients,
so don't worry about a thing!

197
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:54,410
Okay? Okay?

198
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:55,641
Are you sure?

199
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:59,310
I tell you, I'll look after you,
if you don't turn back to normal.

200
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:03,854
I'll pass! No thanks!
No way! No how!!

201
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:07,656
But what a wonderful chance to
get my hands on some new data...!

202
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:13,265
I'm worried...

203
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,301
Do I look funny?

204
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,343
Grade 4, Division 3

205
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,469
The raccoon from Mt. Ponpoko...

206
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:28,742
...lives on Mt. Ponpoko,
so his real name is Raccoon.

207
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:31,010
Wonder what happened to Sasami?

208
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:32,683
Understand?

209
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:34,686
- That scared me...!
- Unreal!

210
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:38,155
What's this? A letter
flying out of the blue...

211
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:42,524
Um, "Sasami Kawai
felt sick in the hall..."

212
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,426
"...so she's lying down
in the sick room."

213
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:47,591
"There's absolutely, positively
nothing to worry about."

214
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,602
"Continue in the pursuit of
knowledge, for mankind's future."

215
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,638
"Washu." That's what it says.

216
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:54,502
What, is that all?

217
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:59,703
Well! Let's continue with our class.
Uh, the raccoon's moniker is...

218
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,043
Sasami's sick!

219
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:04,377
How terrible! I'll go
visit her, later.

220
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:07,052
Goo-Goo!

221
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:10,654
What's gonna happen to me...?

222
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,823
You'll probably be fixed
by the end of the show.

223
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:17,155
I wish you wouldn't make
wild assumptions like that.

224
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:22,699
Sasami's become so adorable.

225
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:25,264
And pretty, just like her name.

226
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:27,631
Yes, right.

227
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:31,541
But you know, now that
SASAMI'S A BABY...

228
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:36,275
...there'd sure be big trouble
if PIXY MISA showed up.

229
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,676
Even Pretty Sammy
would be in real trouble!

230
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:44,246
Okay, okay. I get it, Sis.
We've gotta do it, right?

231
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:53,599
Ooh, that smarts.

232
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,071
Let me have a good look at you.

233
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:04,299
Bust: 30 cm. Waist: 30 cm.
Hips: 30 cm.

234
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:06,806
Remarkable: the same all over!

235
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,144
Hmph! It's a nice body!

236
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:11,479
What's all this measuring for?!

237
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,781
For the future of mankind!

238
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:17,584
Excuse me...
We've come to visit Sasami.

239
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,454
- We've come...
-...to visit.

240
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:22,427
- If they see her like this...!!
-...it'll be trouble!!

241
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:27,997
- Sasami...
- How do you feel?

242
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:29,997
She's fine! No problem!

243
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:34,267
The magnificent scientist,
Washu, is looking after her!

244
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,237
What's the matter with her?

245
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,609
- Pwease don't let them find out...!
- There are things in this world
even scientists can't figure out.

246
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,575
Are you okay, Sasami?
You look like you're in pain.

247
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,585
You're covered in sweat!
Is it a cold?

248
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:50,054
Uh, er... I've got
an owie in my head!

249
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:53,183
- Oh, that's it!
- An owie in her head!

250
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:53,884
Huh?

251
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,892
What's that?!

252
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:58,863
Well, her head hurts, so she's
become kind of childlike.

253
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,564
Hey, did Kawai's head
used to be that small?

254
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:06,196
Okay, all right.
Your break time's just about over.

255
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:08,604
Thank you for visiting.
Good-bye!

256
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:16,147
That was sure a thrill
a minute, hey, Sasami?

257
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,877
Wonder if you wet yourself...?

258
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,050
She got away!
"I don't need your help any more! - Sasami"

259
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:23,213
Why, that...! I still haven't
done enough research!!

260
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:25,547
She won't get far!

261
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:32,355
Where did Ryo-Ohki get to
at a time like this?!

262
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:37,269
I'll hide, so no one finds me,
until I turn back to normal.

263
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:40,966
Something was weird about Kawai,
for sure! Let's go see her again!

264
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,371
Huh?

265
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,501
That's a strange thing...

266
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,949
Do your best this week, too...

267
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,987
"This week, too...?!"

268
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,761
I'll get inside here, for now.

269
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:05,264
P-U!

270
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:08,030
Dum-de-dum-de-dum...!

271
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,729
This is the school Sasami goes to!

272
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:13,931
And these are the shoe lockers!
Although I know that...

273
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,975
- P-Pixy Misa!
- Dum-de-dum-de-dum...?

274
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:21,236
Someone was crying, just now.
Well, who cares.

275
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:24,442
I'm gonna total this school today!

276
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,851
Dum-de-dum-de-dum...

277
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,020
What am I gonna do?!

278
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,918
Sasami! Transform into Pretty Sammy!

279
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:35,085
Didn't you think it
was stinky in there?

280
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,629
Forget that, and transform
into Pretty Sammy!!

281
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:40,632
T-Transform, with my body like this?

282
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,731
No problem! It shouldn't
make any difference!

283
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:47,534
Cause it always turns
out the same!

284
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,708
Oh, yeah! It couldn't turn
out differently from every week!

285
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:53,712
Hurry! This is getting heavy!

286
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,475
Pretty Mutation...

287
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:02,879
...just like always...
Magical Recall!

288
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:18,668
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

289
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:20,968
What the...?! Pretty Sammy?!

290
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:24,571
Count on Sammy, when it comes
to magical boo-boos!

291
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:29,438
What happened?! I went back to
normal when I first transformed!

292
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,941
Must be all kinds of reasons...

293
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,986
This stinks!

294
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:38,083
Oh, Sammy!
So you were right here?!

295
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,954
Mi-Micha!

296
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:45,321
Hm... is the rival who's caused
me so much trouble this cute?

297
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:48,026
Has she become so weak?

298
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:52,771
Micha. What do you say we
don't fight, this week?

299
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,267
Not a chance.

300
00:16:55,908 --> 00:17:00,004
Calling Mystics!

301
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,240
Baby Goods Girl! Let's go!

302
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,408
Goo-Goo, Ga-Ga!!

303
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,851
S-So you're still gonna
be mean to me?!

304
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:13,023
Go to sleep, go to sleep...

305
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,894
I can't breathe...!

306
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:22,899
Go to sleep, little baby...

307
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:24,129
Go to sleep...

308
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:27,866
This was so easy, I don't
even want to get involved!

309
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,339
Hang in there, Sammy!

310
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,877
Ooh, she's doomed...!

311
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:33,309
All right!

312
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,206
This is the worst!

313
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:37,772
Do it! Do it!
Come on! Go, go!

314
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:42,418
What? Oh, thanks.
I was just getting thirsty.

315
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:47,052
That's very tasty... It's you!!

316
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:47,820
V!

317
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:50,522
You're a dangerous teacher!!

318
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:54,589
Yes, and this is a
dangerous drink.

319
00:17:58,938 --> 00:17:59,802
Oh!

320
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,364
I dunno what's going on, but
I'm Super-Misa, stronger than ever!

321
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:07,474
Goo-Goo, Ga-Ga! And I'm
stronger than ever, too!

322
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:08,571
I'm a goner!

323
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:12,612
Thank you, teacher. Now, I'm
more powerful than before!

324
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:17,012
This time I'll win, for certain!
It's the end of Pretty Sammy!

325
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:20,015
Uh-oh!

326
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,151
What was in my drinkie?

327
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:26,392
Newly developed growth accelerator.
And THAT is the side effect.

328
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:28,525
No, no, no! It can't be!!

329
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:34,098
What's happening? My magical
powers have shrunk, too!

330
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:36,068
Thank goodness!

331
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:39,305
I see! Misa drank
that medicine, too!

332
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,778
Ooh, you're all so cute!

333
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,873
I'll collect my data later!

334
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,043
- You can't leave me like this!
- Goo-Goo, Ga-Ga!

335
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:47,915
Sammy! Are you okay?!

336
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:49,086
Ryo-Ohki!

337
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:51,146
This is your chance!
Use your lethal technique!

338
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:53,283
My baton's too heavy;
I can't lift it!

339
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,657
No problem! Put it
in this, and pull it!

340
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:57,787
Good idea! Here goes!

341
00:18:57,864 --> 00:19:00,924
Hey, that's not fair!

342
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,831
Stop!

343
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:05,670
Converge, magic powers of jushtish!

344
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,168
Will this be the same as always,
even though we're so little?!

345
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,568
In that case, you take over!

346
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:15,807
Aah! Just like always!!

347
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:18,749
Baby...Coquettish...Bomber!

348
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:20,645
Are you happy?

349
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:26,421
- You did it, Sammy!
- Count on me!

350
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:30,489
Darn you, Sammy!

351
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:35,500
I'll remember this, and I'll
get you in our next battle!

352
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:38,731
See you next week!

353
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:47,505
- Aah! Classes are out!
- Oh, no!!

354
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,140
- We've gotta hide somewhere!!
- What'll we do?!

355
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:52,184
Good for Pretty Sammy!

356
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:55,020
She sure does her thing,
when she needs to.

357
00:19:55,588 --> 00:19:56,919
Yeah, right.

358
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,617
It makes me wish I had a baby.

359
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,683
Y-Yeah, right!

360
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:07,122
Who'd want a baby?!!
Sammy, you...!

361
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:11,660
I still haven't turned back...

362
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:14,763
According to my calculations,
it shouldn't be much longer.

363
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,138
But I can't go home like this!

364
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:21,040
I told you, I'll look after you,
if it's necessary.

365
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:24,241
And I told you, no thanks...
No way... No how...

366
00:20:24,617 --> 00:20:27,916
I've gathered a mountain...

367
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,820
...of magical data.

368
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,323
My powers...

369
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:37,658
...always produce results.

370
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:42,157
I'll complete my great NT system.

371
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,099
Are you guys satisfied?

372
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:56,070
I wanna hurry and get home!!

373
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:18,364
Imasara ieta girijanai keredo...

374
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:24,703
...watashi wa warukattawa.

375
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:32,711
Otokowa ikuramo iru, nante...

376
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:37,249
...choushini notte orimashita.

377
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,885
Mayonakano juuni-jiwa,

378
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,196
Darenidemo yattekuru,

379
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:50,597
...Cinderella dake janai.

380
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:57,235
Imasara ieta giri janai keredo...

381
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,844
...yononaka nametemashita.

382
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:11,687
Konomama nantoka naru, nante...

383
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:16,387
...choushini notte orimashita.

384
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,698
A mysterious group of wives appear.

385
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:31,675
And the boys melt over
their lovely attacks!

386
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:35,305
Hey! Sammy's much prettier than them!
I won't give in to some wives!

387
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:38,513
Coming next:
The Team, "Lovely Madams."

388
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,381
Be lovely, when you're in trouble!
