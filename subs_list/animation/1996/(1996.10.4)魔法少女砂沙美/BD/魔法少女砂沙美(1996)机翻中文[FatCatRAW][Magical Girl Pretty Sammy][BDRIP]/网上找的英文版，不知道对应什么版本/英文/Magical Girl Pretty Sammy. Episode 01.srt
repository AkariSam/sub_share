1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,614
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,481
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,911
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,979
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,258
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,601
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,072
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,906
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,947
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,575
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,721
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,484
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,327
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,898
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,662
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,333
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,830
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,963
Tsunami. Some nerve being late
for the ascension ceremony.

19
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,936
I forgot to water the flowers
in my room.

20
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,570
You mean flowers are more
important than this ceremony?!

21
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,443
Why is this bungling girl
aspiring to be queen?

22
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,753
Girls of unrivaled magical powers.

23
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,482
As you know, our former queen
passed on one year ago.

24
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,124
The time has come.

25
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:47,133
We will commence selecting
a queen for the next term.

26
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:52,093
First Contact

27
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,032
There is merely one question
for the prospective queens.

28
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:01,004
If you are chosen, what do you
propose to do for our kingdom?

29
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,511
Answer the question.

30
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,481
Romio.

31
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:09,989
I would continue the work of
our former queen.

32
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,324
How about you, Ramia?

33
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,463
Please see the overhead projection.

34
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,725
The population of our kingdom
of Juraihelm has been declining.

35
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,996
To stop this, families with over
2 children should get subsidies.

36
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,909
Divorced couples will be
punished by law.

37
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,206
Forbidden!

38
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,141
For people to pledge allegiance
to the Imperial Rule...

39
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,742
...we need weapons, more public
order and a complaints box.

40
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,079
All right!

41
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,748
And Tsunami?

42
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:45,984
Yes...

43
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,527
If I were to become
queen of Juraihelm...

44
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,366
I would...

45
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,033
...plant flowers throughout
the kingdom!

46
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,169
That is your wish, mistress?

47
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,711
It is.

48
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,211
What a fool.

49
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,675
Juraihelm's decision shall
now be heard.

50
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,056
At last, the moment that I'll
become queen!

51
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,493
Thanks for making me
look so good, Tsunami.

52
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,859
The 208th queen to reign
shall be...

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,690
This is it!

54
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,258
...Tsunami.

55
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,304
Thank you very...!

56
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,669
Tsunami?

57
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,136
That's wonderful.

58
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,178
No way!

59
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,308
It can't be! It can't be!

60
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,162
Listen well. During
the absence of a queen...

61
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,724
...the balance of Gemini
has tilted toward evil.

62
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,529
Yes.

63
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:07,164
As queen, you must restore
Gemini to its original balance.

64
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:12,035
You must meet a kindred spirit
on the planet called Earth.

65
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,672
When this girl bestows us with
the light of goodness...

66
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,876
...you will become the true queen.

67
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,045
Choose this human
you have acknowledged.

68
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,589
My kindred spirit is...

69
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,233
...this girl.

70
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,676
Hi, Sis.

71
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,745
I take it you lost.

72
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:54,116
How can one kick possibly
calm me down?!

73
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,551
It can't! I'm furious!

74
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,024
I have the strongest magic, the
best reputation and best looks!

75
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,162
Why's that flower girl
the queen?!

76
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,994
Tell me! Somebody tell me!

77
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,226
Please?

78
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,896
I won't stand for it! I won't!

79
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,973
Why you... Tsunami!

80
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,706
Oh, yeah.

81
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,375
Rumiya. I came up
with a great idea.

82
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,418
Let it go, Sis.

83
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,926
It's a great plan. If we don't let
Tsunami restore the balance...

84
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,353
I know, but how do we stop her?

85
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,919
Still don't get it?

86
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:43,128
What if the girl she chose from
the odd planet does no good?

87
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,368
The council's decision
will be overturned.

88
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,705
And I will become the queen!
Queen Ramia!

89
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,510
Mean and wily as usual, Sis.

90
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,250
Juraihelm belongs to me.

91
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,248
Ha ha ha!

92
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,948
Ramia.

93
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,416
I'm going down to the Earth
for a bit.

94
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,257
Are you? Well, good luck.

95
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,431
Thanks, Ramia.

96
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,865
Tsunami's magical powers are
pathetic! Why is she queen?!

97
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:23,208
Especially when I possess
such great magical powers!

98
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,938
I'll find my kindred spirit
before Tsunami finds hers!

99
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,507
Shall we, Rumiya?

100
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,380
I'm going too?

101
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:37,048
Of course. We're going to make
my master plan work!

102
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,391
I call it, "The Plan to
Reinstate Queen Ramia."

103
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,925
No way.

104
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:46,021
You just thought it up now!

105
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,370
Miss Tsunami? What am I
supposed to be?

106
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,707
An earth animal, called a "cat."

107
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,750
A cat?

108
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,682
That's right.

109
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,916
You're going to be living
with an earthling girl...

110
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,618
...so I think that form is
best for you.

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,932
I know. Ryo-Ohki, why don't
you go and meet Sasami first?

112
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,368
I'm so nervous,
I don't think I'm ready.

113
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,270
Good luck! Thank you!

114
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,400
Miss Tsunami!

115
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,947
Umi no Hoshi Shopping District

116
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,437
Sasami.

117
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,351
Sasami.

118
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,322
Sasami?

119
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,253
Mom. Dad.

120
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,319
Ready for breakfast?

121
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,365
Or do you want to be late?

122
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,030
This is so typical!

123
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,670
Got to brush!

124
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,202
Come with me, Sasami!

125
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,441
Dad!

126
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,483
Take care!

127
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,114
Have a good day!

128
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,428
G-good morning.

129
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,900
I'm no good at these things.

130
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,901
Misao!

131
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,329
Sorry!

132
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,635
Thank goodness! I thought
you weren't coming.

133
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,439
My alarm didn't go off.

134
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,171
I'm off, Sasami.

135
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,813
Thanks, Dad. Take care.

136
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,349
Good night.

137
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,407
It's still morning.

138
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,453
I like how it sounds.

139
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,087
Good night.

140
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,292
Your dad's so cool, Sasami.

141
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,797
Isn't he?!

142
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:04,325
Miss Kawai! You're not allowed
to come to school by motorbike!

143
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,427
The class leader!

144
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,995
I'll report this to the teacher!

145
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,974
You broke the school rules!

146
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,373
No, please!

147
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,912
Looks like you're in trouble,
Miss Kawai.

148
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,345
What's it to you, Konoha?!

149
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,574
Nothing special.

150
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,617
Come with me.

151
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,418
Run for it, Misao!

152
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,464
What's this creature?!

153
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,858
Wait, Sasami!

154
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,392
I've found her.
That girl is Sasami Kawai.

155
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,979
Good morning, everybody.

156
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,114
My future dreams

157
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,706
And so...

158
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:55,412
...this morning I'd like you
to tell us your future dreams.

159
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,978
Majima, you go first.

160
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,024
I'll be a soccer player.

161
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,060
That's wonderful.

162
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,097
Good luck. Who's next?

163
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,028
Me!

164
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,463
Go ahead, Eimi.

165
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,058
I'm going to be an actress.

166
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,434
Well, that's impossible.

167
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,597
Me!

168
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,231
Yes, Konoha?

169
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,636
My cousin and I are going to
conquer the world!

170
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,578
All right, do your best.

171
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,747
How about you, Kyoko?

172
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:29,448
I want to be an adorable wife,
and have an adorable baby.

173
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,581
We'll do cosplay together!

174
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,490
Have you decided, Misao?

175
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,085
I gave it a lot of thought.

176
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,461
What's your dream? Tell me.

177
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,126
It's...

178
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,136
Misao Amano?

179
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,193
Yes?

180
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,467
It's your turn, Misao.

181
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,736
I, uh...

182
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,446
What's that? I can't hear you!

183
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,150
Um... a pianist.

184
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,846
I can't hear!

185
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,485
Can I tell you my dream?

186
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,527
Sure, go ahead.

187
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,531
I, uh...

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,529
I want to be a kind mother
like my mom.

189
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,630
Marry a cool guy like my dad.

190
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,198
And live happily ever after!

191
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,907
I'm sorry, Sasami.
That just isn't meant to be.

192
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:34,509
Your life is going to be anything
but normal, from now on.

193
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,583
Sasami.

194
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,989
Thanks for helping me in homeroom.

195
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,993
I heard your dream, Misao.
You want to be a pianist, right?

196
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,364
Don't tell anyone.

197
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,199
What a cutie!
Think it's a rabbit?

198
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,406
I think it's a cat.

199
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,502
Whatever. It's still cute.

200
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,712
Won't it bite?

201
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,750
No, it looks tame.

202
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,980
You're right.

203
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,851
Wait a minute.

204
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,855
You're the one that
saved me, earlier.

205
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,691
I'll thank him with some milk!

206
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,562
Hi, Mom!

207
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,396
You're just in time, Sasami.

208
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:27,334
Someone's been waiting for you.
A beautiful older girl.

209
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,170
She said she wants to
scout you.

210
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,176
Scout me?

211
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,212
Who could she be?

212
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,285
Hello.

213
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,481
Who are you?

214
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,287
My name's Tsunami.

215
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,717
Misao, I'll be working late
again tonight.

216
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,750
Dinner will be delivered at
the usual time. Eat it all up.

217
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,923
Leave early so you won't
be late for prep school.

218
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,466
Don 't forget anything...

219
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,836
Same old message.

220
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,773
Mom's always working.

221
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,739
Dad isn't coming back here.

222
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,272
I'm always home alone.

223
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,873
My! Even that gloomy
face of yours is nice.

224
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,780
Who are you?

225
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,790
My name is Ramia.
Candidate to be queen.

226
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,328
Although she lost.

227
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,730
Don't be afraid.

228
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,242
I came for you from
a magical kingdom.

229
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,914
A magical girl?!

230
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,648
Yes.

231
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,588
I want you to be " Pretty Sammy,"
a magical girl...

232
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,320
...and you must restore
world peace.

233
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,852
You can't make me!
I don't know what to do!

234
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,332
Please! You're the only one
who can do it!

235
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,337
No way! The bunny talked!

236
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,274
My name's Ryo-Ohki. I live
in the magical kingdom too.

237
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,679
Ryo-Ohki's purpose here is
to support you, Pretty Sammy.

238
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,147
He's a cat, as you can see.

239
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,707
Cat? Not a rabbit?

240
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,754
Well...

241
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,383
No, I'm a cat!

242
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,856
Sasami.

243
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,296
Take this magic baton and
transform into Pretty Sammy.

244
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,767
Magic baton?

245
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,337
It looks crummy.

246
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,895
Think so?

247
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,138
Sasami. Change into Pretty Sammy
and you'll have magical powers!

248
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,776
Magical powers?

249
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,181
If I had magic...

250
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,775
...I could get that
electronic organizer!

251
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,686
And clothes, and games!
Wow!

252
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,087
I'll try it!

253
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,352
I'm so glad.

254
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:39,454
The incantation is
"Pretty Mutation Magical Recall."

255
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,662
No problem!

256
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,895
Pretty Mutation...

257
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,473
...Magical Recall!

258
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,356
Pretty Sammy is here!

259
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,491
Huh. So this is the new,
magical me.

260
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,901
I don't want this.

261
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,699
Why not?

262
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,932
Because!

263
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,974
I look stupid in this.

264
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:29,475
If anyone finds out about this,
I'll be the laugh of the town.

265
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,816
I can't explain it but now I'm
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

266
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,421
What is that?!

267
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,855
What a freak!

268
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,155
That's against the rules!

269
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,860
Is that some kind of joke, Sasami?

270
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,563
That's what'll happen!

271
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,802
It'd be the worst!

272
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:58,832
There's nothing to worry about,
because you'll be Pretty Sammy.

273
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,879
That's not the point!

274
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,514
It's getting late.

275
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,473
I'll leave it to you.

276
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,348
Okay.

277
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,114
No!

278
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:09,916
Oh!?

279
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,891
Sasami?

280
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:17,121
I mean Pretty Sammy.
I'm counting on your help.

281
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,663
No!

282
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,829
How irresponsible...

283
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,861
Hello, CD Vision.

284
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,807
Hello. I'd like a CD delivered.

285
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,639
All right.

286
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,043
4 chome, number 16.

287
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,014
Thank you very much.

288
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,680
Okay, get going.

289
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,617
Go and give Tsunami's chosen girl,
Sasami, a hard time.

290
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,893
There. Handle the rest, Rumiya.

291
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,328
Wait, Sis!

292
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,864
Bye-bye.

293
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,560
It's your job! You can't leave!

294
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,135
No way!

295
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,468
What happened to that scout?

296
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,132
She left.

297
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,110
Oh, yeah? What was she
scouting for, anyway?

298
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,706
For magical girls...

299
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,580
Is this for delivery, mom?

300
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,481
Yes.

301
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,577
I'll take it.

302
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,918
Look after him.

303
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,185
All right.

304
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,920
You're sure cute.

305
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,062
I hope I wasn't too mean.

306
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,099
How can she expect me to
suddenly become a magical girl?

307
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,464
What should I do?

308
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,504
Sasami!

309
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,738
- Why did you follow me?!
- Because!

310
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,642
I came to this planet to help you!

311
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,112
Think of the trouble you'll cause me!

312
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,945
Sasami!

313
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,985
Go away!

314
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,653
Sasami!

315
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,283
Sorry, but good-bye!

316
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,759
He'll never find me here...
I hope.

317
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,262
4 chome, number 16.

318
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,168
It's close by.

319
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,777
That's strange.

320
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,778
It should be right here.

321
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,184
Who's there?

322
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,626
What?

323
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,667
What's going on?!

324
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,133
Stop!

325
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,040
Welcome, Sasami!!

326
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,075
Who are you?

327
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,515
My name is...

328
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,817
Tell you next time.
See you next week.

329
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:09,327
Once again, the girl you're watching...

330
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:14,661
...isn't the real me.

331
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,636
It's a girl...

332
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,079
...that was made up...

333
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:30,577
...for you and for our love.

334
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:38,622
You like my honesty.

335
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:44,025
That's what you say...

336
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,400
...but it's an illusion.

337
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,438
Deceiving others is a way of life.

338
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,540
It's a woman's romance.

339
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,913
I love you more than anyone.

340
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,943
I want to show you
a wonderful dream.

341
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,218
I love you so much.

342
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,151
I'm going to keep deceiving you.

343
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:13,790
I'll make you happier...

344
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:20,628
...than any other guy in the world.

345
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,114
The girl was a fiendish coach.

346
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,243
She came from her kingdom
to teach Sammy some skills.

347
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:38,253
Huh? I have to do squat jumps?!
That's bad for my health!

348
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,183
Coming next: The Crash Course.
