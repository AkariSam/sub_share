1
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:13,928
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:16,795
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:20,224
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,329
...tsukai you!

5
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:32,572
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,915
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,385
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,219
...demae ni yatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:47,261
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:49,889
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:54,068
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:55,831
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:00,641
...genki ni nareruwa.

14
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:04,245
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

15
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:07,009
Fushigi na chikara ga.

16
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:10,714
Yume mireba yume mo...

17
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:14,179
...yume janai.

18
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:36,042
Two magical girls, Pixy Misa VS. Pretty
Sammy. The people who suddenly came...

19
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,045
...and put a complete stop to their
magical competition on Friday...

20
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:41,445
...were the bewitching beauties,
the Pixy Mrs. Team.

21
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,813
Otherwise known as the Team,
"Lovely Madams."

22
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:47,081
Sammy counters with her
Pretty Coquettish Bomber.

23
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:52,182
But Sammy's Pretty Space is destroyed
by the Lovely Madams' Lovely Space.

24
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:56,060
Sammy's lethal technique doesn't work.
Does she have any other shots?

25
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,691
What fate's in store for Sammy?!
What fate's in store for the world?!

26
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,830
They'll be like candles in
the wind, of course!

27
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:06,867
Sammy, hurry and let them do
you in and overthrow you!

28
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,903
Then I'll be queen of Juraihelm!

29
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,569
The one and only me!

30
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:16,582
Farewell, The Team,
"Lovely Madams"!

31
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,789
Oh!

32
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,632
The balance of the scales
has completely slipped!

33
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:38,069
Pretty Sammy's lost!

34
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,333
What in the world
will happen to me?

35
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:44,206
Whether I'll be queen
remains to be seen.

36
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:47,839
Oh, what a fix, what a mess,
what shall I do?

37
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,980
What a fix, what a mess,
what shall I do?

38
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:52,919
What shall I do?

39
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:58,391
Sammy...

40
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,630
Sammy! Wake up, Sammy!

41
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:07,661
Ryo-Ohki...

42
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,202
You're awake.

43
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,134
Where am I?

44
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:12,035
Misa captured you!

45
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:13,198
Oh...

46
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:16,266
Anyway, you've gotta try
to escape somehow!

47
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,241
But how?

48
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:19,745
Magic! Use your magic!

49
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:22,941
But if I can't wield the baton,
I can't use my magic.

50
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:29,317
Too bad, hey, Sammy.

51
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,087
To think the opening story will
be adorned with this mood...!

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,452
It makes me super happy!

53
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,303
Umi no Hoshi Elementary School

54
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:44,203
The world's one and only
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy...

55
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:48,605
...has lost the battle against the self-
professed evil magical girl, Pixy Misa.

56
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:50,701
Pretty Sammy has been captured.

57
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,313
Occupying the area
surrounding Sammy are Misa...

58
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:57,509
...and the mysterious group
calling itself, "Lovely Madams."

59
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:01,385
Even the police, who rushed to the
scene, cannot get imprudently close.

60
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:04,886
The government is regarding
this situation as serious...

61
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,756
...and has moved in the Self-
Defense Forces to save Sammy.

62
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,626
Also, a beautiful women warning
has been issued in the Kanto area.

63
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:13,428
The strategic headquarters
has been established on-site...

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,968
...and the rescue operation
is about to get underway.

65
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:19,297
This is Saotome, reporting live.

66
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,766
So that's the magical girl, huh.

67
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:24,333
Poor girl. Hey, Captain?

68
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:27,670
Can people win against
magic with science?

69
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:32,742
I wouldn't know such a thing. But our
job here is to rescue Pretty Sammy.

70
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,483
She's solved a number of troubles
up till now, so to repay her...

71
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:39,287
...our mission here
must be a success.

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,327
Yes, sir.

73
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,889
The national army division will
arrive from the east any moment.

74
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:48,061
Right. "Operation Rescue Sammy"
will commence when they arrive!

75
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,329
- Captain?
- What is it?

76
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:52,099
It seems we're losing some of
the Team, "Lovely Madams"...

77
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,866
- W-What?!
- See?

78
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:57,937
Fool! Why didn't you
report this sooner?!

79
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,171
S-Sorry, sir!

80
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:04,377
Attention! We're going all out
to rescue Pretty Sammy.

81
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,080
However, this is a rescue
operation, not a war!

82
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,183
Don't forget it!

83
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:14,791
A person?!

84
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:18,093
No, that's the target
headquarters told us about!

85
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,559
She's a beauty!
Absurdly beautiful!

86
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:24,570
Beauty Rating of 78%!
That's four times the norm!!

87
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,269
Lovely!

88
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,673
Mrs. Kiss!

89
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,382
That's the power of the Team,
"Lovely Madams."

90
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:45,322
Land Hawk was headed this way,
but communications were cut off!

91
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:46,288
What...?

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,797
C-Captain. This doesn't look good.
They must've been attacked!

93
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:53,799
Don't let your mind run amok!
What about the air troops?

94
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,792
Doesn't look good!
I can't reach them!

95
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,275
I knew it! They've been attacked!

96
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,403
I told you not to run amok!

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,107
Captain! Telephone!

98
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:10,509
It's me.

99
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:14,042
Oh, Prime Minister!
My apologies.

100
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:16,886
Yes. Yes.

101
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:19,949
What?! You'll send the 7th
Fleet for our backup?!

102
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:37,803
Jesus...!

103
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:40,439
Lovely Madam voice!

104
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,278
Where are you off to,
my darling?

105
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:49,182
Japanese karaoke!

106
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,454
I've got another 50 songs in me!

107
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:00,898
Well, Kenji?

108
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:04,369
Both the Self-Defense Forces and the
UN Forces seem to have been attacked.

109
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:07,532
Darn it! Isn't there
some way to help Sammy?

110
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,337
Aha, I see.

111
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,401
Thought so. The Team, "Lovely
Madams" has incredible abilities.

112
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,882
Oh, Professor Washu! Don't just play with
your gadgets! Can't we do something?!

113
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,510
Like using missiles, or ultra
special weapons, or something?

114
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,646
Well actually, if the Self-Defense
forces could get blown away...

115
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:26,557
...an ordinary citizen like me
couldn't save Sammy.

116
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,520
That's not grounded in reality.

117
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:33,160
Sammy...

118
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,438
Ryo-Ohki. I'm hungry.

119
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:39,403
Me, too.

120
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,441
Mistress Misa. Sorry
to keep you waiting.

121
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:43,736
Please, help yourself.

122
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,711
Wow! That really looks great!

123
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:51,451
Oho! You've got the look
of a glutton.

124
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,487
You want to have this, Sammy?

125
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,791
Want it?

126
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,591
Of course, I'll give it to you.

127
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:03,289
NOT!!

128
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,797
Wow! Wonderful!!

129
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,993
I put caviar inside the cake.

130
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,039
The wisdom of the Lovely
Madams, if you will.

131
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:17,270
Hooray for the Lovely Madams!
Well, Sammy?

132
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,579
I don't want your cake!

133
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:23,881
Still giving me lip, are you?!

134
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:26,151
- Third!
- Right here!

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,385
W-What're you gonna do?

136
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:30,923
Why, you should know that!

137
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,084
I'm gonna tickle you, of course!

138
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:37,189
Huh?

139
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:40,927
Stop it!
That tickles!

140
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:46,435
You've gotta smile and be happy;
that's what life's about!

141
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:50,806
Sammy, let me hear more
of that beautiful laugh!

142
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,547
I'm dying! I'm dying!

143
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:56,649
Sammy!

144
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,708
Looks like Sammy's having fun.

145
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:01,049
If you get any more zoned out,
I'll finish you off!

146
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:02,019
Sorry...

147
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,948
Sammy's in trouble. Can't
something be done?!

148
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,961
But we got word from the top,
over the phone just now...

149
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,123
...and they said that WE must
handle the rest by ourselves...

150
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,633
I was thinking, sir.

151
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:18,102
Fleeing might be in order;
escapees come out on top.

152
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,334
You call yourself a soldier?!

153
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:23,541
I think so...

154
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:27,271
The Lovely Madams have now
regrouped on the school grounds.

155
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:31,346
They're on alert, radially
surrounding Pretty Sammy.

156
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,909
They're so strong,
and there's six of them.

157
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,978
There's nothing we can
do to stop them.

158
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,489
You still mouthing off?!

159
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:41,516
But considering their strength
against these troops alone...

160
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,454
Seems you're in a bit of a trouble.

161
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:47,200
Who the heck are you?!

162
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:51,331
I'm the father of Sasami, the girl
rumored to look a lot like Pretty Sammy.

163
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:53,373
The name's Ginji.

164
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,665
Hey! This is off limits
for civilians!

165
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,181
That move...!

166
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:07,017
Oops. Seems I've not-so
accidentally dropped my wallet.

167
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,622
Would you get it?

168
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,091
Oh, my!

169
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,687
You were a member of the
special task force SWAT team?!

170
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,097
A long time ago.

171
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:23,159
You must've come here
with some kind of plan.

172
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,534
The Lovely Madams are
undoubtedly lovely.

173
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,699
"Pretty Power" probably
can't stand up to them.

174
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,506
But what about "Dandy Power"?

175
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:34,069
Counter "Lovely" with...

176
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:35,842
...I see! "Dandy"!

177
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,851
In that case, just
leave this up to me.

178
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,183
I have confidence, when it
comes to being a dandy.

179
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:46,157
"Ginji," wasn't it?
Would you take over this?

180
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,251
- This "Dandy" plan.
- Sure thing.

181
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:59,205
Ginji!

182
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,538
You're leaving, Ginji...

183
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:03,735
Yes. I don't know why...

184
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:08,111
...but seeing Pretty Sammy is like
seeing my very own daughter.

185
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,648
Figure it out already, Ginji

186
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:11,379
Yes, that's true.

187
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:12,383
You, too.

188
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:15,922
Take care.

189
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:23,662
Johnny.

190
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,163
It's Ginji.

191
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,462
I'll say just one thing.

192
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,628
You're using "Dandy Power"
against "Lovely Power."

193
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,672
In theory, you're not mistaken.

194
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:36,437
But that alone won't beat
the Lovely Madams.

195
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:38,842
Is there some other way?

196
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:42,507
There's some remaining energy
in Sammy's Pretty Space.

197
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:46,683
I wonder if that girl knows the
meaning behind the heart marks?

198
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,123
Thank you, Catherine.

199
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,588
It's Washu.

200
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:57,524
Hang on, Sammy.
I'll rescue you, somehow.

201
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:08,068
I am the future queen!

202
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,403
Tsunami...!

203
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,975
Oh, Ramia.

204
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:15,242
Sammy, poor Sammy,
she's in quite a bind!

205
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,341
Oh, my. Oh, my.

206
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,511
Please, Ramia?
Won't you dance with me?

207
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:22,555
Come on, please?

208
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:23,823
All right.

209
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:27,622
The balance of the scales
has completely slipped!

210
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:30,492
Pretty Sammy's lost!

211
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:33,800
What in the world
will happen to me?

212
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,159
Whether I'll be queen
remains to be seen.

213
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:40,365
Oh, what a fix, what a mess,
what shall I do?

214
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,732
What a fix, what a mess,
what shall I do?

215
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,680
How much could you bear
to bare in a polar bear swim?

216
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,949
Freezing...

217
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,592
Don't lick icy sticks or
you'll stick to the icy sticks.

218
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,388
Like it? This is the
Mrs. Love-love Blizzard!

219
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:11,337
If they keep up such bad jokes,
I'll freeze to death.

220
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,371
Yeah!

221
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,246
Now, let's move on to the climax!

222
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:23,507
Yes, Misa!

223
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,982
The humiliation
you've put up with...

224
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,916
...and the anger and sadness!

225
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,120
We'll throw it all
back in the face...

226
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:31,714
-...of Pretty Sammy, over there!
- Yeah!

227
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,088
Oh, yeah, baby!

228
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:36,420
What?!

229
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:37,929
Keep attacking until Dandy gets there!

230
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:39,898
Yes, sir!

231
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,399
Come on, Sammy!

232
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:43,402
It's good to stuff
a rock inside, huh.

233
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,665
That's dangerous! Stop it!

234
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:47,740
Very cunning!

235
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,776
Lovely Madams' Snowball!

236
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,109
- D-Damn!
- We're snowmen!

237
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,715
Now suck your thumbs and watch us!

238
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:02,584
They can't even find their thumbs,
let alone suck on them!

239
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,915
- Misa! Finish Sammy off!
- Yeah!

240
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:07,984
All right, whatever.

241
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:09,528
No!

242
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:12,327
Sammy! This is good-bye!

243
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,166
Ow! Ow! Ow!! Ow!!

244
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:24,301
She's weak.

245
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,273
Are you okay, Sammy?

246
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:28,314
Dad!

247
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:31,545
I'm Sasami's dad,
not your dad, Sammy.

248
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,586
Oh, yeah, right.

249
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:36,779
That was SO unfair!

250
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,790
Mrs.! Go for it!

251
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,286
Lovely!

252
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,962
Dandy!

253
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,463
What a dandy face!

254
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:47,796
I have a soft spot for
guys like him!

255
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,267
He stopped the Lovely Madams
in their tracks!

256
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,601
Unreal!

257
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,903
No, this is just temporary.

258
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,901
That's right. Your Pretty Space
is adorable, and nothing more.

259
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,842
Oh, how adorable!

260
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,281
Precisely! Even this monkey
can be adorable.

261
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:10,050
Trying to beat the Lovely Madams
with something adorable is a joke!

262
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,115
Then what'll we do?

263
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,921
Catherine told me this.

264
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:17,430
What you're lacking is love!
The power of love!

265
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:20,364
Pour the power of love
into the Pretty Space!

266
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:23,425
That's easy for you to say.
But I'm just a kid!

267
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:25,528
I don't know anything
about love!

268
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,873
Just fake it for now!

269
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:29,909
But, with who?

270
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,240
He's right there!
Beside you!

271
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,012
What?!!

272
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:42,950
During all that, we were
surrounded by the Lovely Space.

273
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:46,356
It's love! Show them
the love between you two!

274
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,957
- Ryo-Ohki...
- Sammy...

275
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,328
Um...

276
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:53,389
...I love you, you know.

277
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,031
You can't be shy!

278
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,865
But the important thing
is to be a TEENY bit shy!

279
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,899
Sammy, I love you!

280
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:01,497
More heartrending!

281
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,632
I really love you.

282
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,677
More bittersweetly!

283
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:15,320
Huh? Hey, why aren't
you starting the battle?!

284
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,879
The Lovely Madams are
soldiers of love.

285
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,585
We cannot interfere with
matters of the heart.

286
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:22,759
Ryo-Ohki.

287
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,225
Sammy!

288
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,167
I love you.

289
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,932
Me, too.

290
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,834
Throw much stronger feelings
at each other!

291
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:34,563
I love you! I really
love you, Ryo-Ohki!

292
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:38,008
Sammy! I love you more
than anyone in the world!

293
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,013
I'm so happy to be with you!

294
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,515
Let's stay together forever, Sammy!

295
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:48,247
Ryo-Ohki, you're embarrassing me...

296
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,221
That's the ticket!!

297
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:54,086
Way to go,
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.

298
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,957
Wonderful!

299
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:58,497
But it's still nothing compared
to our Lovely Space.

300
00:16:58,565 --> 00:16:59,930
You said it!

301
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,866
Why? What's happening,
Mrs. One?!

302
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,164
They're calling for me.

303
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,330
Oh, where did Miyuki get to...?

304
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,806
That's a good boy.
What to do...

305
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:14,540
Satoshi and Saki are calling me.
I have to go!

306
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,707
No way, One! Keep focused!

307
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:25,214
- Our Lovely Space...!
- It's pretty!

308
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:39,328
That's the power of love!

309
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,872
Now's your chance, Sammy!

310
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:44,106
Converge, magical powers of justice!

311
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:54,810
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

312
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,216
I'm in mega-trouble!

313
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:03,255
Huh?

314
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,590
Mrs.!

315
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,636
Don't cry, Misa.

316
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,538
You'll make a mess of
your precious pixy face.

317
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:18,339
Misa, you can use Lovely
Power, too. Just like us.

318
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:21,169
- We guarantee it.
- Yeah!

319
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:22,646
Don't leave me!

320
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:25,980
Misa, being affectionate,
and having sympathy...

321
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,577
...those are the fundamental
points of being a Mrs.

322
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,258
Mrs.!

323
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,797
There, there.

324
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:13,823
- Satoshi.
- Oh...

325
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,632
Sorry I'm so late.

326
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:19,069
There, there. Sorry, Saki.

327
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,571
Mrs... I've definitely received it.

328
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,137
Your Lovely Power!

329
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,847
W-We're back to normal...

330
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:37,089
The magical girl did it.

331
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,552
Yeah.

332
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,422
We did it! We did it!

333
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,223
Way to go, Sammy!
You still had all that power!

334
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:46,322
No wonder Tsunami picked
you to be the magical girl!

335
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,367
Thanks, Ryo-Ohki!

336
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,159
Ow, you're squishing me, Sammy!

337
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:52,204
Oops, sorry.

338
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:59,536
The balance of the scales
has completely returned!

339
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,604
Pretty Sammy's won!

340
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:06,179
Hooray! Hooray! She did it again!

341
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:09,483
Hooray! Hooray!! A perfect "10"!

342
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,991
No...

343
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:12,492
Hooray! Hooray! She did it again!

344
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:15,859
- NOOO!!!
- Hooray! Hooray!! A perfect "10"!

345
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:18,890
Here are the notes from today.

346
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,432
Thanks.

347
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,195
Are you okay, Misao?

348
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:26,034
Yeah, I'm fine. I just fell
down the stairs, that's all.

349
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:30,169
I made some cake, Misao.
Would you like some?

350
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:32,211
Thanks a lot!

351
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,046
It's fantastic!

352
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,743
Yeah, it is!

353
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:41,184
I tried putting
some caviar inside.

354
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:43,085
That's the wisdom
of the Lovely Madams.

355
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:45,181
Then, hooray for
the Lovely Madams.

356
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:47,249
Yeah, hooray!

357
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,586

00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:29,390
A girl named Hikari Asahina
transfers to my school.

369
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:32,863
She says she's come to our town
in search of Ryo-Ohki.

370
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:35,230
Coming next:
You Are the Sunshine Girl.

371
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:40,231
I'm sorry, Hikari. But I
wanna stay with Ryo-Ohki.
