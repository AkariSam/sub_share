1
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:14,521
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:17,388
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:20,921
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,920
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:33,165
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,508
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:39,979
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:43,813
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:47,855
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:50,483
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:54,628
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,425
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,865 --> 00:01:01,235
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:04,838
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:07,602
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:11,308
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:14,772
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,671
Hi, my overly energetic
boys and girls!

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,875
Today we're going to have a
new friend join Division 3.

20
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:45,843
What?!

21
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:47,107
A transfer student?

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,114
Sure hope it's not Boss...!

23
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:00,426
Hello. My name's Hikari Asahina.

24
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:01,726
Nice to meet you all!

25
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:03,763
Wow!

26
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:06,656
She's pretty!

27
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,400
Okay now, everyone try to
get along with Hikari.

28
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:13,234
As for your seat...

29
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,207
...next to Majima's a good place.

30
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,209
That seat's taken!!

31
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:27,111
Come, come, Haida.
Move back to your own seat.

32
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,615
Hi!! You can call me Hikari.

33
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:35,453
- I'm Sasami Kawai.
- Sasami, huh!!

34
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,520
Oh, and this is Misao Amano.

35
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:40,156
Oh. Nice to meet you, Amano.

36
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,664
H-Hello...

37
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:46,665
Let's be friends, Sasami!

38
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:52,234
You Are the Sunshine Girl

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,961
This is the Tulip Song!

40
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,936
The Tulip Song?
Wrong, Teacher!

41
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:20,372
Wow, she can play the piano!
Hey, what did she teach you?!

42
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,177
Oh, my!

43
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:25,166
It's NOT the Tulip Song, okay?!

44
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:30,845
Now, won't one of you play
a lovely song for me?

45
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,314
Teacher, Misao's really good
at playing the piano!

46
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,115
Oh, is that right?

47
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,057
I've never heard that Amano
plays the piano before.

48
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:41,151
Me, either!

49
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:43,526
I assume she's great!

50
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:46,191
If she's terrible...
...that'd be a joke, huh?!

51
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,200
- That's for sure!
- Sasami, I can't...

52
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:52,471
Try playing the song you played
for me the other day. Okay?

53
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:54,470
But...

54
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,532
Please play, Misao.

55
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,407
Teacher, can I play?

56
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,446
Sure, go ahead.

57
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:11,024
Oh, my...!

58
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,167
She's good!

59
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:25,136
Yeah, she's great!

60
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:34,306
I've come all this way, Ryo-Ohki.

61
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,774
What a wonderful melody!

62
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,680
- What's it called?
- I wanna buy the CD!

63
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:43,154
Me, too! Me, too!

64
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:45,487
I wrote the song myself.

65
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:48,456
I wrote it about
a very special friend.

66
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:50,120
Really?!

67
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:53,860
That beautiful melody comes
straight from your heart?!

68
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:57,170
Stop it!

69
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:58,898
Oops, are you okay?

70
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:00,940
You pack a big punch!

71
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,407
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No problem.

72
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,436
Oh, yeah! Sasami?

73
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,173
Yeah?

74
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:11,240
You're good at dodge ball, right?
Can't wait till gym class!

75
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:12,785
Huh...?

76
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:17,587
- Caught it!
- She sure did!

77
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:19,625
Way to go, Hikari!

78
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:24,393
Kawai's serves put people out
87.2% of the time, though!

79
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,159
She's incredible!

80
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,201
Now, it's our turn!

81
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:34,841
Wow!

82
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:36,569
Good job, Sasami!

83
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:39,510
Never known anyone who could
catch that ball, up until now!

84
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:42,477
Okay! This time I'll put you out!

85
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:46,447
- Wow! She caught it again!
- There!

86
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,926
Grade 4, Division 3

87
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,963
- Sorry!
- Sasami, what about your lunch?

88
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:00,465
Gotta take care of something!
Be right back!

89
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:05,364
- Where'd Sasami go?
- I wonder.

90
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,810
Sasami!

91
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,212
Over here!

92
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,179
Ryo-Ohki!

93
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:17,614
Well? Did something strange happen?

94
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:20,983
No. Although we did get a
new transfer student, Hikari.

95
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,288
- Hikari...?
- What is it?

96
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:26,120
Oh, nothing. Anyway,
after school we're gonna work...

97
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:28,957
...on your magic training.
Don't forget, okay?

98
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,155
Ohhh!

99
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,189
Sasami! You're not ready for enemies
like the Lovely Madams, right?

100
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:37,634
You've gotta train to master the
magical powers you used then!

101
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:40,135
Yeah, I know, but still...

102
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:41,731
You're training!

103
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:42,331
Devil!

104
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,969
- Did you say something?
- Not at all!

105
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:46,676
Someone's coming!

106
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:47,235
Huh?

107
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:50,340
I'll be waiting by the
river after school, okay?

108
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,976
- Blah!
- I saw that!

109
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,192
Sasami, were you just
talking to somebody?

110
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,661
Huh? No, I wasn't talking
to anybody, Hikari.

111
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,719
Oh.

112
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,766
What are you doing
back here, anyway?

113
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,394
Well, lunch is starting,
and you weren't there.

114
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,000
You were looking for me! Thanks!

115
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:15,564
That's what friends are for, right?

116
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:18,010
Yeah! Let's head back.

117
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,641
Wow! You've got a cat,
huh, Sasami?

118
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,209
What's its name?

119
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:29,084
We call him Ryo-Ohki.

120
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,285
I wanna see him! Can I come
over to your place, Sasami?

121
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,350
Well, uh...

122
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,521
You're training, Sasami!

123
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,462
We don't keep him inside,
so he might not even be home.

124
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:44,236
Oh, really. That's too bad.

125
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,965
Amano, have you seen
Ryo-Ohki before?

126
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,905
Huh? Yeah...

127
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:51,441
What's he like?
Tell me about Ryo-Ohki.

128
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:53,775
Nice, I guess? Is he cool?

129
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,405
He's cute, and gentle.

130
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:58,918
That's not true!
Ryo-Okhi's nice, and he's cool!

131
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:00,612
Right, Sasami?

132
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:03,887
Hey, what about tomorrow?
Can I come see him tomorrow?

133
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,517
Um, I'm not really sure.

134
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,019
I'll tell you when he comes home.

135
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:10,460
For sure, okay?

136
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,293
Yeah...

137
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,793
This is Juraihelm's
future queen, Tsunami.

138
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:19,669
I'm out on a trip at the moment,
and nobody's in the room.

139
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,973
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:25,910
Tsunami's easygoing, considering
the deliberation process is still on.

141
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,745
That girl never changes.
But this is a good chance!

142
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:33,411
What are you gonna do?
Even the Lovely Madams failed.

143
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:36,349
It will be a bit
different this time.

144
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,585
Ramia, I met that girl.

145
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:41,259
Rotten, isn't she?!

146
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:43,455
She's nothing like you said.

147
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:46,328
She's a really nice girl.

148
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,562
You're completely wrong!
She ticks people off!

149
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:53,231
Who knows what she's thinking!
She's the worst!!

150
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:55,536
Sounds more like you, Sis...

151
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,379
Now I'll show you what
that girl's REALLY like.

152
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:03,973
Uh... okay.

153
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:07,984
Come off it, Ryo-Ohki!
You blundering cat!

154
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:10,986
Take this, you good-
for-nothing fur ball!

155
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:14,459
Oh, Sammy! Please stop!
I'm scared! It hurts, Sammy!

156
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,395
"Stop?!" Yeah, I bet
you wish I'd stop!!

157
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:20,192
Somebody help me, please!!

158
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,961
One more punch!

159
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:23,430
That's terrible!

160
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:27,906
Yeah! She just pretended
to be a good girl around you.

161
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,771
This is what she's really like.

162
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,471
Pretty Sammy's a devil!
She's evil!

163
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:35,713
That's right. You've got to use
your powers to save him.

164
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,875
Your beloved childhood playmate!

165
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,520
I understand, Ramia.

166
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:46,015
Pretty Sammy.
Wash your face and wait...

167
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,527
I'll wash.

168
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:51,996
Oh, I'm all muddy!

169
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:55,057
You've gotten a lot better!
We'll train here tomorrow, too.

170
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:58,969
If we keep it up for a month,
your magical powers will be up to par.

171
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,938
"A month?!" I can't
keep it up that long!

172
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,342
I won't be able to play with
Misao! Or play dodgeball!

173
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:09,211
It's for Tsunami, and for the
sake of justice! Bear with it!

174
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,982
Unfortunately,
I'm not that patient!

175
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,681
Wait, Sasami! Hey,
I'm talking to you, Sasami!

176
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,723
Sorry!

177
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:22,620
It's too much to expect
Sasami to train every day...

178
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,255
...when she's a grade
school student.

179
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,234
Better think up another plan...

180
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,664
Ryo-Ohki!

181
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,709
Y-You! It can't be...!

182
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,513
Everything's all right, now.

183
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,483
Okay, let's take attendance.

184
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,051
- Amagi.
- Here.

185
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:58,298
Oyamada.

186
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:00,766
- Majima.
- Ryo-Ohki's been gone ever since.
Where did you go, Ryo-Ohki?

187
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,298
"A month?!" I can't keep
it up for that long!

188
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,938
It's all because I said that.

189
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:14,275
Oh, Asahina's absent, isn't she?

190
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:16,946
Are you worried about Asahina?

191
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:18,313
Huh?

192
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:19,908
Yeah, of course you are.

193
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,647
What do you mean by that?

194
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:24,053
Nothing. Forget it.

195
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:28,252
Hikari, how did you get
to this planet?

196
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:31,519
A kind person used her magic
to send me here.

197
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:32,554
Who?

198
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,896
Doesn't make any difference.

199
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:37,960
Ryo-Ohki, I came to take you back!

200
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:38,594
What?!

201
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,502
Let's return to Juraihelm!

202
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:42,097
W-What're you talking about?!

203
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:45,235
I've gotta stay on this
planet and support Sammy.

204
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:47,541
Even though she treats
you so bad?!

205
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:48,945
"Treats me so bad...?"

206
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:51,609
Sammy bosses you around
every day, right?!

207
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:54,676
That's not true at all!
Sasami's a little blundering and lazy...

208
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,654
...but she's a good girl!

209
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:58,953
She ordered you to say that!

210
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,822
No way!!

211
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:03,024
Oh, boy...

212
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,530
...he must've been through
so much intimidation!

213
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:09,029
Anyway, it was good to see you.
I'll be back to Juraihelm...

214
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:12,094
...when the judging is over.
Say hi to Tsunami for me.

215
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,972
No! You're coming back now!

216
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,011
Hikari...!

217
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,978
We're going back together, Ryo-Ohki!

218
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,914
For sure! For sure!
That's what we're doing, for sure!

219
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:30,188
Oh, yeah. I forgot about
your power, Hikari...

220
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,191
Ryo-Ohki?

221
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,223
Ryo-Ohki?

222
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,963
Ryo-Ohki?

223
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:46,005
Ryo-Ohki, are you listening?!

224
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:48,467
Ryo-Ohki?

225
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,004
I've looked everywhere
I thought he might be.

226
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,570
Ryo-Ohki, where did you go?

227
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:58,310
You've gotten a lot better!
We'll train here tomorrow, too.

228
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,719
Of course!!

229
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:06,119
Hey, Kawai is going home
without Amano today...

230
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,626
- Here's your chance.
- What's that mean?!!

231
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,788
Just that I think
it's your chance.

232
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:12,888
What're you trying to
say, Kenji?!

233
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,530
Sasami...

234
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:25,742
Ramia! Ramia! Return us
to Juraihelm! Please!

235
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,709
Hey! You listening, Ramia?!

236
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,250
Sasami...

237
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:35,153
I like this kind of silly stuff!

238
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,923
Ryo-Ohki. I'm sorry!
I'll apologize!

239
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,419
I'll work on my magical training!

240
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:44,195
Don't disappear on me! Please!

241
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,172
Ryo-Ohki... That's mean!

242
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:56,265
I don't want you to leave me!

243
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,443
Don't just leave,
without saying anything...

244
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:00,570
Sasami.

245
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:02,745
Sasami!

246
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,146
Ryo-Ohki!

247
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:07,709
Sasami. Can you hear me?
If you can, answer me!

248
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,256
I can hear you!
Where are you?!

249
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:12,051
Oh, it's no use.

250
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,650
I guess it won't work unless
she transforms into Sammy.

251
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:18,128
That's not true! I can hear you!
You're coming in loud and clear!

252
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:20,893
Sasami, I'm at the school!
I'm up on the roof!

253
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:25,533
Please, gods of magic! Let
Sasami hear my voice somehow!

254
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,330
Can't you hear me?!

255
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,877
Would you listen to me?!!

256
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,908
It's no use. Hikari's magic
has robbed me of my strength.

257
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:39,717
Sorry, Sasami. It doesn't look
like we'll see each other again.

258
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,120
Ryo-Ohki!!

259
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:43,348
Sasami!!

260
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:46,620
Thank goodness! I've been
looking all over for you!

261
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:48,058
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:49,355
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

263
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,590
Sasami, you're squishing me...

264
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:56,428
Hey! What do you think you're
doing with my Ryo-Ohki?!

265
00:14:56,703 --> 00:15:01,163
Hikari! Look, Hikari,
this is Ryo-Ohki!

266
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,902
Duuh!! I know who he is!!

267
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:05,301
Huh? How so?

268
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:08,711
Actually, we're both from
the same magical world.

269
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,305
She's my childhood friend.

270
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,374
What?!! Hikari is?!!

271
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:16,116
Hmph! I don't like you
sounding so familiar!

272
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:18,817
You made Ryo-Ohki miserable,
you devil incarnate!

273
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:21,783
"Devil incarnate?"
Who, me?

274
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:24,761
She seems to think so...

275
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:27,258
I won't hand Ryo-Ohki
over to you!

276
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,100
Time for a showdown!

277
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:35,432
Those eyes... she's being
manipulated by evil magic!

278
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:36,668
Sasami!

279
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:40,270
Ryo-Ohki, my baton.
I'll transform into Sammy!

280
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,448
That's the way!

281
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:48,320
Pretty Mutation...

282
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:51,856
...Magical Recall!

283
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:08,607
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

284
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,206
Leave it to Sammy, when it
comes to magical predicaments!

285
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:13,438
I'm here, with
renewed determination!

286
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:15,447
You may have transformed
into a magical girl...

287
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,484
...but you won't beat me!
Here I come, Sammy!

288
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:25,390
What do I do? I can't
just attack her...

289
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:29,454
Nice move.
You're pretty athletic, huh.

290
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,121
But how's your magic?

291
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,058
No, Sammy!

292
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:36,568
Minimum power!
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

293
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:40,372
Barrier!

294
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:43,275
Back at you!

295
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:48,280
Sammy! Don't give up!

296
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,280
It hurts...!

297
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:55,582
Too bad, Sammy.
I've got the ability to absorb...

298
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:58,287
...and to repel magical energy.

299
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:00,552
Then I can't use my magic!

300
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:04,028
All the pain and humiliation
you've caused Ryo-Ohki!

301
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,532
I'll pay you back for it!

302
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:10,802
Sammy hasn't done anything bad!
Figure it out, Hikari!

303
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,394
You're so kind, Ryo-Ohki.

304
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:14,440
You're wrong, I tell you!

305
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,671
Please, Hikari!
Let me stay with Ryo-Ohki.

306
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:22,271
I'm still immature, but
I've got to try my best.

307
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:25,181
So I've got to have
Ryo-Ohki here with me!

308
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:26,115
You liar!

309
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:29,382
I'm not lying! He means
a lot to me! Really!

310
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:30,717
Sammy...

311
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:35,118
He's important to me.
Really, really, important to me!

312
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,932
That's the power!
That's Sammy's real power!

313
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:54,875
Go ahead and shoot!
The stronger magic you try...

314
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:58,405
...the more YOU suffer, Sammy!
Come on! Do it!

315
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,992
Sammy!!

316
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,350
Ryo-Ohki!

317
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:10,920
I'm fine.

318
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:12,328
Hang in there!

319
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:15,162
Why did Ryo-Ohki cover for her?

320
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:19,002
Something's not right.
Sammy's a bad girl, right?

321
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:25,100
She is, right? That's why I came
all the way down to the Earth...

322
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:30,071
For Ryo-Ohki's sake.
To bring him back.

323
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,508
Hikari...

324
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:34,417
Sammy, please.
Drive away that evil magic...

325
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:37,513
...that's got Hikari under its spell.
You'll be able to do it, now.

326
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,023
Yeah!

327
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:43,524
Please, Hikari!
Return back to normal!

328
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,525
Converge, magic powers of justice!

329
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:56,564
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

330
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,071
Hikari!

331
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:05,640
Ryo-Ohki. I'm so sorry.

332
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:08,346
Thank goodness,
you're back to normal!

333
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,455
Thanks, Sammy!

334
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:11,717
Yeah!

335
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,419
Hikari's returned
to her normal self.

336
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:16,461
No way! How...?!

337
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,868
I'm sorry Ryo-Ohki.
I was so thoughtless.

338
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:26,966
Well, that's not news to me.

339
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,098
You, too, Sammy. I'm sorry!

340
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:30,574
Mm-mm.

341
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:32,970
Anyway, who cast a spell on you?

342
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:35,103
- It was...
- Hikari...

343
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,683
Looks like our time's up.

344
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,348
Hikari...!

345
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:45,680
Come over for a visit, when
you get back to Juraihelm, okay?

346
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:47,923
Yeah, I will for sure.

347
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:51,521
Sammy. No, I mean, Sasami.
Take good care of Ryo-Ohki.

348
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:54,860
You'll be my first
Earthling friend, right?

349
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:56,231
Of course!

350
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:58,270
Thanks!

351
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:09,744
Ryo-Ohki.

352
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:11,749
Guess I'm just a bit homesick.

353
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:14,115
- Okay! Time for training!
- What?!!

354
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,987
Come off it, not today!!

355
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:20,782
So, I know this
is kind of sudden...

356
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,596
...but Hikari Asahina
has transferred.

357
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:24,824
- What?!
- Again?!

358
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:27,127
She was only here for a day!

359
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:32,595
Too bad, huh, Misao?

360
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:34,366
Yeah.

361
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,501
And she'd just become
our new friend, too.

362
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:40,169
- Huh?
- No?

363
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:42,146
Uh, yeah, I guess you're right.

364
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:44,182
But friends can still be friends...

365
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,582
...no matter where they are.
Although you kind of miss them.

366
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,444
No matter where we are...

367
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:51,649
...I'll be Sasami's friend.

368
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:19,846
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

369
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:26,251
...but I was wrong.

370
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:34,532
To say there are any number
of guys out there...

371
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,764
...I should've known better.

372
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:43,400
Midnight,

373
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:46,802
Comes to anyone,

374
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:52,109
...not only to Cinderella.

375
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:58,680
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

376
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:05,463
...but I've made light
of the whole world.

377
00:22:05,998 --> 00:22:13,427
To think that somehow things
would turn out all right...

378
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:18,136
...I should've known better.

379
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:30,384
Misao's dad is coming home,
and Misao looks so excited.

380
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:32,083
Her dad likes red roses.

381
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:35,286
But Pixy Misa shows up,
and then I...!

382
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:40,864
Coming next:
The Magic Fades Away.
