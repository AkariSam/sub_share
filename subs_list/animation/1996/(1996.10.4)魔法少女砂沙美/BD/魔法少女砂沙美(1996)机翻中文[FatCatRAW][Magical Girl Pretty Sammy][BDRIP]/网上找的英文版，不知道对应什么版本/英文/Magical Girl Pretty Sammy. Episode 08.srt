1
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:14,581
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,516
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:20,876
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,946
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,225
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,568
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,038
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,872
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,914
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,542
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,687
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,450
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,294
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,864
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,628
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,459
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,806
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,186
Hello, everyone.
I'm a candidate to be queen...

19
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,755
...of the wonderful magical
world of Juraihelm.

20
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,802
But she lost.

21
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,805
My name's Ramia.

22
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:51,810
Now I'd like to tell you about my
boring, yet provoking situation.

23
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,738
It all started because of
Sasami Kawai, or Pretty Sammy.

24
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,280
The more good deeds
she does on Earth...

25
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,321
...the closer Tsunami gets
to becoming the true queen.

26
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,148
This flower-loving girl...

27
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,023
...this dimwitted girl is
a candidate to be queen.

28
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,261
Would you stand for this?

29
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,300
You wouldn't, right?
I won't either.

30
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,535
Therefore!

31
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,365
I swear I will overthrow
Pretty Sammy!

32
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,972
To put it in writing... This!

33
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,010
Pretty Sammy,
I'll get you! Ramia.

34
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,242
Today I'll rip her to shreds
and make her bawl like a baby!

35
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,977
And you're going to dream
up a plan right now, Rumiya!

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,522
Huh? Who, me?

37
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:40,482
Mid-Summer Santa

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,728
Today's Sunday - my day off!

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,424
So Misao and I are hanging
around together all day!

40
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,228
And there are no prep classes.

41
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,930
Misao, look! It's 64 bit,
next-generation hardware!

42
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,906
With nothing special, but...
a new puzzle game!

43
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,942
Wow.

44
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,743
And I got a high score!

45
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,380
Wow.

46
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,417
I'll play against Ryo-Ohki!

47
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,285
He crushed me!

48
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,283
Wow.

49
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,352
Look, here's your horoscope
by Miss Tokimi!

50
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,764
People with your birth date have
love, money and health!

51
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,358
You're super-lucky in all areas!

52
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,334
I'm glad.

53
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,838
Look! Homework from my
home economics class!

54
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,842
Mom made it for me.
Well, what do you think? Well?

55
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,608
It looks wonderful!

56
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,340
All right!

57
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,746
But won't the teacher get mad?

58
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,883
Huh?!

59
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,682
You might be right,
come to think of it.

60
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,722
Sasami...

61
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,858
I wonder if they have anything
in common to talk about...

62
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,430
I'm home!

63
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,125
Hi, Misao.
Over for a visit?

64
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,561
Hello.

65
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,728
Are you finished work, Dad?

66
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,103
Yeah. It was pretty tough
dropping those oxygen cylinders.

67
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,475
But I brought down 3
all together, today.

68
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,704
Oh, wow!

69
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,906
Sasami, what does your dad
do for a living?

70
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,347
All kinds of things.

71
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,781
Oh.

72
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,511
Stop that, Sasami.
You're embarrassing me.

73
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,747
"Why's that, Ginji?"

74
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,617
Help yourselves.

75
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,122
Looks delicious!

76
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,821
Huh?

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,988
P-Professor Washu!

78
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,833
Hi, Sasami. Right now
I'm just Washu-chan.

79
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,870
Oh, really?

80
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,303
But my cake...!

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,374
It was scrumptious!

82
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,005
I'll give you 92 points today, Honoka!

83
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,473
High score!

84
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,711
My cake...!

85
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,349
- Huh?
- Let's split mine.

86
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,322
Thank you, Misao!

87
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,155
Well, maybe I'll watch
TV for a bit.

88
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,621
She sure is making
herself at home...

89
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,923
I'm a cake!

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,491
Eat me. Eat me!

91
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,766
Eat till you can eat no more,
and I'll massacre you.

92
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,506
N-No! I prefer spicy foods!

93
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,203
What about it?!

94
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,980
What a masterpiece!

95
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,950
Japanese shows ain't that bad,
huh, Johnny?

96
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,986
My name's Ginji.

97
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,447
I'm a cake! I'm a cake!

98
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,422
Help!

99
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,015
I lost my appetite.

100
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,924
I'm scared, Sasami.

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,396
Don't worry, Misao.
It's just a show.

102
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,022
But...

103
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,691
Ginji!

104
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,395
I'm scared! I'm scared!

105
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,301
Honoka.

106
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,636
I suddenly feel so happy.

107
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,676
Isn't that great, Johnny?

108
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,806
It's Ginji.

109
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,183
Victory

110
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,475
Aren't you done yet, Rumiya?

111
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,215
Night is falling on the Earth.

112
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,383
I want to use a magnificent
plan of attack, today!

113
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,186
- Sis?
- Are you done?

114
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,696
No, I can't think of anything.

115
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,592
What's that? I couldn't hear.

116
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,636
S-Stop, Sis...!

117
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,969
There!

118
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,030
Is that you up there, Ramia?

119
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,566
Oh, Tsunami. What are you doing?

120
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,578
Just watering the flowers.
And you?

121
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,443
Huh?!

122
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,576
Uh, Rumiya asked me to help
him with his studies.

123
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,550
What?

124
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,451
How admirable.

125
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,251
But... uh...

126
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,654
Oh, that reminds me.

127
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,098
I was just going to look in
on Sasami's progress, Ramia.

128
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,069
If you'd like, why don't we
watch together in my room?

129
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,629
Oh, what a wonderful idea.

130
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,675
- Then shall we?
- Yes.

131
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,641
Better think of something, Rumiya.

132
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,608
I'll do my best, Sis.

133
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,940
I was having so much fun
up until a while ago.

134
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,480
And now I'm completely
alone, here.

135
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,326
Help! Help me!

136
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,733
La-la-la-la-la...

137
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,648
Sasami? Can I join you?

138
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,345
You sure can!

139
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,681
The Lethal Flood Technique!

140
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,058
Gee whiz, Dad!

141
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,994
Sorry.

142
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,869
What are you doing, Ryo-Ohki?

143
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,307
I know. He wants us to wash him.

144
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,813
All right. Come here.

145
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,808
Now, now. Quit that struggling.

146
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,344
Good! All done!

147
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,750
Aren't you glad, Ryo-Ohki?
You're all clean, now!

148
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,590
Sasami! Misao's on the
phone for you.

149
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,993
Okay!

150
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,260
Hello? Did you forget
something here, Misao?

151
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,202
Sasami...!

152
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,931
What's wrong? Are you crying?

153
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,973
Sorry, Sasami.

154
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,739
I heard a strange noise.

155
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,403
It sounds like someone's
outside the window.

156
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:07,902
I'm scared.

157
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,277
Misao...!

158
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,284
Mom's not coming home tonight.
I'm all alone.

159
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,780
I just wanted to hear your voice.

160
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,882
Misao! I'll come right over
to your house!

161
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,426
Huh?

162
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,419
Can I stay over?

163
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,262
Yeah.

164
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,698
Thanks! I'll be right over,
so just hang on.

165
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,600
Mom, I'm just going to...

166
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,771
Go to Misao's house, right?

167
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,807
Your bag's all packed.

168
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,272
And here are your things
for school tomorrow.

169
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,373
Thanks, Mom and Dad!

170
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,782
Let's go, Ryo-Ohki.

171
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,444
What's wrong?

172
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,917
Just a little head rush.

173
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,476
Forget it; you're coming!

174
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,187
- Oh, Sasami?
- Yes?

175
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,286
Um... are you going out
in that charming outfit?

176
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,830
Huh?

177
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,098
I've got to get dressed!

178
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,335
Hurry, Ryo-Ohki!

179
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,929
What?

180
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,706
Sasami's going out at
this time of day?

181
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,608
I doubt if it's for a walk.

182
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,147
No, something must be up.

183
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,446
And I've got to find out
what it is! Yay!

184
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,247
I'm here, Misao.

185
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,859
Sasami!

186
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,925
Everything's all right;
I'm here now.

187
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:40,902
Which one?

188
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,464
Um... Maybe this one.

189
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,341
Or this one?

190
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,845
Maybe this.

191
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,814
Or this? This one.
No, this one.

192
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,784
This one!

193
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,649
Ugh! I lost!

194
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,188
Can't win when the answer's
written all over your face...

195
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,721
Sasami is such a kind girl.

196
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,223
She lost on purpose
just to cheer Misao up.

197
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,160
Yes, she is a kind girl.

198
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,694
Now that Sasami's there, Misao
would be fine even if a ghost came.

199
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,796
That's right.

200
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,706
Fool! As if a ghost would...!

201
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,812
Rumiya! I just thought of
a great plan!

202
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,746
I call it, "The Plan to
Squelch Sammy with a Ghost. "

203
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,681
What's that mean?

204
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,413
Quiet! Just have Misao
transform to Misa.

205
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,998
Aah!

206
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,556
- Sasami?
- Yeah?

207
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,658
Thanks for coming over.

208
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,860
Don't be silly; that's
what friends are for.

209
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,939
Can we hold hands?

210
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,635
Yeah!

211
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,408
Night, Misao.

212
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,417
Night.

213
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,061
What's this?

214
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,937
Dad... Mom...

215
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,547
Misao? Oh!

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,353
Ryo-Ohki. Ryo-Ohki.

217
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,824
What?

218
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,360
Misao's gone.

219
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,089
Probably gone to the bathroom.

220
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,898
Huh? Is this a blackout
or something...?

221
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,397
Misao?

222
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,200
Misao?

223
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,476
Anybody would be scared here.

224
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,778
M-Misao!

225
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,281
What's wrong, Misao?

226
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,085
Greetings, from the bathroom!

227
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,892
Ryo-Ohki! A ghost!
I saw a ghost!

228
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,328
- Ryo-Ohki, listen!
- A ghost?

229
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,326
There's really a ghost!
In the bathroom!

230
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,166
It smiled at me-e-e!!!

231
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,604
It's scary! It's so scary!

232
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,507
Then why not transform into
Pretty Sammy and get rid of it?

233
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,209
You're right!
I can use my magic!

234
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,482
It's the first time
I've been glad I'm magic!

235
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,745
- Here.
- Okay.

236
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,623
Pretty Mutation...

237
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,649
...Magical Recall!

238
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,472
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

239
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,537
You'll be safe, night or day!
Ghosts are no problem!

240
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,647
Ghosts are... no problem.

241
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,684
Well, I'm STILL scared, though...

242
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,322
Oh, it's noisy!

243
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,965
A ghost!

244
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,729
A ghost!

245
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,706
Sammy!

246
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,749
What are you doing, Misa?

247
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,852
Why? Didn't my Secret
Plan of Fear work on you?

248
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,488
I get it!
You conjured up the ghost!

249
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,423
Bull's-eye, once again!

250
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,018
And you made Misao disappear?

251
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,758
Yes! I've got her tucked away.

252
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,390
Where?! Where is she?!

253
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,098
Want to see?

254
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:03,998
Show me!

255
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,037
Just a moment.

256
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,740
Misao!

257
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,340
Sammy... why am I...

258
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,648
You'll never escape, Misao!

259
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,710
M-My head...

260
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,787
Misao!

261
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,722
And there she was, you see?

262
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,065
How come you're panting?

263
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,828
I have my reasons!

264
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,960
If you want to rescue Misao...

265
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,097
...you'll have to fight my
Love-love Monster!

266
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,675
Ghost Girl!

267
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,642
Love-love Monster Ghost Girl

268
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,235
A... a ghost!

269
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,747
Let her possess you, Sammy!

270
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,820
Stupid manager!

271
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,982
Idiot. Darn it.

272
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,650
Huh?

273
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,353
Huh? What?

274
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,631
Santa?

275
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,765
Think you got your
seasons mixed up!

276
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,395
You're a good man, Santa!

277
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,931
Get away!

278
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,609
This monster doesn't have a body!

279
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,444
No! What am I supposed to do?

280
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,484
I'll think of something.

281
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,644
It's too late for that!

282
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,281
I'll possess you!

283
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,020
No! No, no, no!

284
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,788
If I'm possessed, I'll start
being bound by ghosts at night!

285
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,525
And I'll get all kinds
of letters of misfortune.

286
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,257
And maybe I'll get hit by a car!

287
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,803
I don't want that kind of life!

288
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,810
I'm not listening, Sammy.

289
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,811
See you in heaven.

290
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,847
No!

291
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,306
Huh?

292
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,715
What? What's that sound?

293
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,812
Jingle bells...?

294
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,647
Merry Christmas!

295
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,529
Santa's come out-of-season for
the good, little magical girl.

296
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,499
What are you doing,
Professor Washu?

297
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,972
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa.

298
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,110
What makes you Santa?

299
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:29,375
Everyone knows it's Santa Claus
who brings presents to good kids.

300
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,676
Presents?

301
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,684
That's right.
Here's your present.

302
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,744
What's this?

303
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,123
This is an aerial chemical
element fixation device.

304
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,423
All you do is yell, "Sammy Flash,"
and press this switch on its head.

305
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,928
And, boom! It's amazing!

306
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,262
This wonderful machine will make
the monster develop a body!

307
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,130
Oh, and one more present.

308
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,362
What is this?

309
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,066
An observation device to measure
magic energy's numerical value.

310
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,108
It really suits you, Sammy.

311
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,906
Why are you doing this, Santa?

312
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,675
This Santa likes researching things.

313
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,148
Sammy!

314
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,084
It's totally unfair to call
someone for help!

315
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,018
I didn't ask for help!

316
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,888
Enough excuses!
Ghost Girl! Get her!

317
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,197
Okay, I'll look into this.

318
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,323
Not fair!

319
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,368
Sammy! Use that machine!

320
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,472
Sammy Flash!

321
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,044
Wow! Thanks, Professor Washu!

322
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,376
I said, my name's Santa!

323
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,647
Sammy! The Pretty Coquettish Bomber!

324
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,881
Yeah!

325
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,902
Converge, magic powers of justice!

326
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,941
Fantastic! The magic's numerical
value is higher than I imagined!

327
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:10,974
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

328
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,077
You did it, Sammy!

329
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,951
Count on me!

330
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,422
Bravo! Wonderful!

331
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,258
I've gathered some fantastic data.
Thank you, Sammy.

332
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,955
See you.

333
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,004
Oh, yeah.
Misa! Let Misao go!

334
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,599
Misao!

335
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,935
Sasami?

336
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,811
I'm so glad you weren't hurt!

337
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,744
Misa didn't do anything to you?

338
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,248
- What do you mean?
- Don't you remember anything?

339
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,218
No, my head just hurts a little.

340
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,618
Is that all? That's good.

341
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,521
Sasami? Who's this " Misa"
person you mentioned?

342
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,225
Just forget it. Let's go
back to your room.

343
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,193
Yeah.

344
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:06,300
Oh? Pretty Sammy must have done it
again while I wasn't watching.

345
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,639
Keep up the good work,
Pretty Sammy!

346
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,710
Who was that red-clad girl
that came out of nowhere?

347
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,383
W-Wasn't it Santa Claus?

348
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,352
You idiot!

349
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,719
Next week we'll send out even
stronger Love-love Monsters!

350
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,125
We'll squelch her!
Just you wait, Sammy!

351
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,852
To put it in writing... This!

352
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,192
I'll show you, Sammy! Ramia.

353
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,335
Misao, we're gonna be late!
Hurry! Hurry!

354
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,336
Sorry, Sasami.

355
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,371
Oh?

356
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,703
Huh?! A reindeer!

357
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,033
What is it?

358
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,045
Gee... I dunno.

359
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,779
Well, shall we?

360
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,817
Yeah!

361
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:07,231
Once again, the girl you're watching...

362
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,559
...isn't the real me.

363
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,408
It's a girl...

364
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,968
...that was made up...

365
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:27,474
...for you and for our love.

366
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:36,519
You like my honesty.

367
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:42,026
That's what you say...

368
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,432
...but it's an illusion.

369
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,402
Deceiving others is a way of life.

370
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,437
It's a woman's romance.

371
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,936
I love you more than anyone.

372
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,849
I want to show you
a wonderful dream.

373
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,150
I love you so much.

374
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,219
I'm going to keep deceiving you.

375
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,821
I'll make you happier...

376
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:18,659
...than any other guy in the world.

377
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,408
I accidentally find
Pixy Misa's secret base...

378
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,072
...and I head for the place
right away!

379
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,378
Misa, I won't let you get away
with anything bad anymore!

380
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,442
Pretty Sammy finally strikes seriously!

381
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,851
Coming next:
The Island of Love-love Monsters.

382
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,857
Count on Sammy when
it comes to magic incidents!
