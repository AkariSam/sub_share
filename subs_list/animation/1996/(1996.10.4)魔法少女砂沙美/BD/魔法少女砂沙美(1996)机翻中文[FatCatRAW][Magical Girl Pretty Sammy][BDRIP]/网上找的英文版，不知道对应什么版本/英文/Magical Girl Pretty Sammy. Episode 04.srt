1
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:04,871
The invincible Pretty Sammy
has one weak spot;...

2
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:06,909
...jumping over the vaulting box.

3
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:10,607
At this rate my grade for gym
will be an "F"!

4
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:12,845
Coming next:
Jump Over The Top!

5
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,612
Call Sammy
when you're in trouble!

6
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:30,600
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,467
...soko ni aru mono de.

8
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:37,000
Juumon to atama ga...

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,974
...tsukai you!

10
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,244
Onaka ga sukeba...

11
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,587
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

12
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:56,058
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

13
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:59,892
...demae niyatte kuruwa.

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,933
Nemuku nattara...

15
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,561
...battan no juuten.

16
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:10,707
Yoko ni nareba...

17
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:12,470
...asa niwa...

18
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,313
...genki ni nareruwa.

19
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:20,884
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

20
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:23,648
Fushigi na chikara ga.

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,456
Yume mireba yume mo...

22
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:30,825
...yume janai.

23
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,475
I'm Ryo-Ohki, and I come from
the magic kingdom of Juraihelm.

24
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:59,018
Sasami's the kindred spirit of
our candidate for queen, Tsunami.

25
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,689
I'm here to help Sasami out.

26
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:06,357
But strangely, Sasami doesn't
like turning into a magical girl.

27
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,454
And the evil Pixy Misa...

28
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:12,000
...and her Love-love Monsters
also showed up.

29
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:15,338
How will this all turn out?

30
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:20,298
Jump Over The Top!

31
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:48,760
Thank you!
Thank you very much!!

32
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,701
This week we're going to practice
with the vaulting box.

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,806
What a drag. I wish we were
playing soccer instead.

34
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,575
Right, Kenji?

35
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:02,214
Kenji?

36
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,515
She's great.

37
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:08,882
Even more wonderful than usual.

38
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:11,455
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:17,132
I'll test you tomorrow. If you
can't do this, practice hard.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,896
Okay, split into groups.

41
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:21,730
Yes.

42
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,340
Wonder what's going on?

43
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,001
Why?

44
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:33,174
How come?! Why am I in
a different group from Hiroto?!

45
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,712
Hurry up and go, Haida.

46
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:40,779
On top of that, how come
he's with that shy bimbo?!

47
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,889
I won't forget this!

48
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:49,358
You're better off keeping
those thoughts to yourself.

49
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,170
What is it, Misao?

50
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:57,967
Nothing.

51
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,236
What's taking you?
Hurry up and jump.

52
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:04,042
Why can't the boys go first?

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,215
Okay, I guess I'll have to
show you how it's done.

54
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,356
Hiroto's so wonderful!

55
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,597
You're backing up the system here!

56
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,964
Wow! That was fantastic!

57
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:28,061
It was nothing.

58
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:33,475
You're up, Kenji.

59
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:37,479
What's the matter?

60
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,453
She's elegant.

61
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:48,190
Forget that and take your turn.

62
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,719
Go for it, Oyamada!

63
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,693
Thank you!

64
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,923
Watch where you're going!

65
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,657
Oops.

66
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,262
This isn't my best sport.

67
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:06,908
Yeah, yeah. Hurry and get off.

68
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,878
Next it's my turn!

69
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,112
Way to go, Sasami!

70
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,621
Your turn, Misao.

71
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:22,588
Yeah.

72
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:26,517
You can do it, Misao!

73
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:45,846
Amano can't even jump over
that little vaulting box.

74
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:50,113
Don't say that! Everybody
has something they can't do!

75
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:51,676
Is that so?

76
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,779
Misao.

77
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,187
Sasami.

78
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:58,659
Let's practice and I'll
show you how to do it.

79
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:04,130
We'll practice too.

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,827
Give it your best.

81
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,460
You need practice, not me!

82
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:20,342
Anyone could vault over this.

83
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:29,088
What do you think you're doing?!

84
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,297
I thought I'd make it over.

85
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:44,231
Sorry to keep you after school.

86
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,207
It's okay.

87
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,937
Let's practice vaults
so you make it tomorrow.

88
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:54,216
You're here too?

89
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:57,012
Oyamada's training.
What about you?

90
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:58,951
Misao's practicing.

91
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:06,159
I don't mind. Just
don't get in our way.

92
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,288
We won't get in your way!

93
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:15,968
Misao, you've got to be
stronger off the springboard.

94
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:19,470
I know, but I'm scared.

95
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,375
You'll be fine; be brave!

96
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,639
Hiroto.

97
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:27,075
Here goes!

98
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,453
Listen.

99
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:35,958
At least spread your legs!
Don't sit on top!

100
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:39,726
Don't think of anything else!
Wham! Bring your arms down!

101
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:43,356
Spring! Off the board!
And boom! Land on your feet!

102
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,434
"Wham! Spring! And boom!"?
Wow, vaulting is really hard.

103
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,805
Hiroto?

104
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,479
Majima?

105
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:00,107
It's so irritating!
What're you afraid of?

106
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:04,146
Have some guts and spring
higher off the board.

107
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:08,118
When your hands hit the top,
push off them and swing over.

108
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,885
Got it?

109
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,355
What's gotten into you?

110
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:14,862
You two are so sloppy
I can't stand it.

111
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,024
That's no way to talk!

112
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,061
Try it, Amano.

113
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:24,039
Faster!

114
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:28,710
Jump!

115
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,354
I did it.

116
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:42,186
You did it, Misao!

117
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,518
Sasami.

118
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:46,994
See, you can do it if you try.

119
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:50,989
Um...

120
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,591
What is it?

121
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:57,005
Thank you.

122
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,074
What's going on between them?!

123
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:05,539
My Hiroto's with that girl.

124
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:08,448
Even if God forgives them, I won't.

125
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:12,044
What a beautiful friendship!

126
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,383
Teacher!

127
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,427
Konoha!

128
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:21,729
I'm so happy to be
in charge of you all!

129
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:24,489
I hope you'll always
be my friend.

130
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,535
S-sure.

131
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,700
I'll split them up!

132
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:34,170
So? What should I do now?

133
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,178
Oyamada was sitting on top!

134
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,008
He was?

135
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,048
Like an old woman drinking tea.

136
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:46,145
And Misao got really good
at the vaulting box.

137
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:50,386
What a nice surprise;
good for her.

138
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:55,556
Didn't you think she could?
I've known that for a long time.

139
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,593
She is Sasami's friend after all.

140
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,703
You got me there!

141
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:07,540
You want some more?
Okay, hang on.

142
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,240
Eat up.

143
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,417
He's become part of the family.

144
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,528
That's what happened.

145
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:32,257
I didn't think a vaulting box
would be an obstacle for Misao.

146
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,829
She is my partner after all.

147
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:38,063
What's our next plan?

148
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,442
Well... of course we'll get
that fool Sammy.

149
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:47,278
But maybe we should teach
that mean girl a lesson too.

150
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:51,646
Because she's bullying
our little Misao.

151
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:08,893
Tagging along wasn't a good idea.

152
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:13,437
Time for gym class.

153
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,000
Is everyone ready to start?

154
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:18,740
Ready?

155
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:23,073
Isn't our teacher mistaking us
for kindergarten kids?

156
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,019
She looks wonderful again today.

157
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,520
I see.

158
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,682
Did you learn how to vault, Oyamada?

159
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,483
With room to spare, Kawai.

160
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,924
After LOTS of work.

161
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,394
That's great.
We'll all pass the test.

162
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:40,532
Let's start testing you
on the vaulting box.

163
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:44,835
Excuse me! I have a suggestion
before we start!

164
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,598
Oh? What's that?

165
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:50,845
Test us a block higher,
at 6 blocks.

166
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:56,045
Even third graders can
jump over 5 blocks!

167
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,282
6 blocks?

168
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,187
What are you suggesting, suddenly?

169
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:04,988
Are you afraid or something?

170
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,721
That's not it...

171
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:10,732
Then there's no problem.
Or maybe there's someone else...

172
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,859
...who's afraid to vault?

173
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,732
Well, uh...

174
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:19,533
It's decided! We'll do the test
with 6 blocks.

175
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,075
Yes!

176
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,402
If no one disagrees,
then I suppose...

177
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:32,449
The first boy is Oyamada.

178
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:34,716
- Yes.
- Show your stuff!

179
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,024
- Yeah, Oyamada!
- Way to go!

180
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:42,093
It was a cinch!

181
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:44,595
A check for Oyamada.

182
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,532
Next is Amano.

183
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:47,591
Yes.

184
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,002
You can do it, Misao!

185
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:53,766
It's high.

186
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,544
Come on, what's taking you?

187
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:11,793
I'm scared.

188
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,689
Can't you even jump over that?!

189
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:18,164
You're a disgrace.

190
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:19,201
No!

191
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,236
Misao...?

192
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:24,306
What are you doing?

193
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:25,674
I can't.

194
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,675
What's the matter?

195
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,711
Misao!

196
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:34,006
Misao!

197
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:39,054
I've kept you waiting.

198
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:42,386
I'm Magical Girl Pixy Misa!

199
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:44,522
Not again!

200
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,892
The girl from
the Success Prep School!

201
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:49,123
A friend of yours, Konoha?

202
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:53,258
She's no friend of mine,
she's a magical girl!

203
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,326
A magical girl...?

204
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:58,271
That gaudy outfit is
against school rules!

205
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,235
You can't stop me with
those petty rules.

206
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:06,412
I'm a crab. I'm a crab...

207
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,242
Where are you going, Sasami?

208
00:14:09,318 --> 00:14:11,718
Let me go! I'm going
to look for Misao.

209
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:14,684
Before that, why don't we
play a while?

210
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:19,917
Calling Mystics!

211
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,400
HE-E-EY!

212
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,873
Who is this?

213
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:41,315
This week's Love-love Monster
is P.E. Girl!

214
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,275
The pleasure's mine.

215
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,010
What is it?

216
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,680
I know. A monster!

217
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,323
P.E. Girl! Show these kids
how wonderful sports are.

218
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:56,788
Ready... go!

219
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,324
Ready... go!

220
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,995
Ready... go!

221
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:04,932
Shot put!

222
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:07,737
Shot put!

223
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:09,904
Shot put!

224
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:12,345
Everyone! In this situation...

225
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:13,745
Yeah?

226
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,841
...first, we must breathe deeply.

227
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:20,354
That hurt...

228
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,025
Sweating while doing sports
is so beautiful.

229
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,326
Right, Sasami?

230
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:29,854
She took off!

231
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,093
That Misa...!

232
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:35,033
Sasami.

233
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:36,862
Don't scare me!

234
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,907
Transform into Pretty Sammy!

235
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,335
But the whole class is there!
And I've got to find Misao.

236
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:46,506
Sammy's the only one who
can rescue the class.

237
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,949
I'm getting into this
deeper and deeper.

238
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,324
Pretty Mutation...

239
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:59,725
...Magical Recall!

240
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:15,940
Pretty Sammy is here!

241
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,043
Go, go, go, go!

242
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:20,846
Shot put!

243
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,646
This is it! I'm going to die!

244
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,016
Aha. You finally made it.

245
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,756
I come when needed!

246
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:33,920
Hello! I'm Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

247
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:37,589
I'm a little late, but I made it!

248
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,366
Been waiting, Sammy!

249
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,460
Outdoor shoes aren't
allowed in the gym!

250
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,061
Don't be such a stickler!

251
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,536
P.E. Girl! Give her
a good thrashing!

252
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,674
Here comes one!

253
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:53,074
Pretty Home Run!

254
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,975
Not bad, Sammy.

255
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:58,019
How about this?

256
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:00,818
Magical Whistle!

257
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,788
What?

258
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,829
My body's moving by itself!

259
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:12,192
You're trapped! This is the end!

260
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:16,268
I can't move!

261
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:19,939
The final blow, P.E. Girl!

262
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:22,437
Joints for the final blow!

263
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:32,011
I'm gigantic!!!

264
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:34,548
The parts combined!

265
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:36,921
Ready... go!

266
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,827
It's gonna hit me!

267
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:40,521
Victory!

268
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:45,033
I can move!

269
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:50,105
I won.

270
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,083
One, two, three!

271
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:05,179
Why?!

272
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:08,153
They're vaulting boxes.
They're hollow.

273
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:11,619
Hey! Darn!

274
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:14,085
Pretty Jump!

275
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:18,365
- Unreal!
- What a great jump!

276
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:25,299
Oops.

277
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:29,074
Converge, magic powers of justice!

278
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,619
What is this?!

279
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:47,093
The Pretty Space.

280
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:48,993
This is Sammy's magic, too.

281
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:50,622
This is our second time here.

282
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:52,963
This is my second time too, Hiroto!

283
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:54,969
Get off me!

284
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:57,005
- P.E. Girl?
- Yes?

285
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,869
Catch you later. Bye!

286
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,705
Don't leave me!

287
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:14,479
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

288
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,228
Sudden Death!

289
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:26,364
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!
Today's problem is solved!

290
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:29,370
Right?

291
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,973
Well, not entirely.

292
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:37,205
Anyway... see you!

293
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,906
She ran away!

294
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,881
Wh-what just happened here...?

295
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:54,559
Look, Ramia! I made it over!

296
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,693
Ramia?

297
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:08,033
Huh... I...?

298
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,078
Misao!

299
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:13,005
Misao!

300
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:14,207
Sasami.

301
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,012
Let's go back.

302
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,711
But...

303
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:21,680
Just think about yesterday.
All you need is courage.

304
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:23,190
Courage?

305
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:26,056
Yeah. Don't give in to your
fears before you try!

306
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:28,096
You'll jump over if you
have courage.

307
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:35,095
Courage... courage.

308
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,336
- Did it!
- No way!

309
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:46,809
Amano... 6 blocks. Check.

310
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:53,611
V...

311
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:58,215
We messed up again.
Sis won't be happy about this.

312
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,134
Oh, well.
