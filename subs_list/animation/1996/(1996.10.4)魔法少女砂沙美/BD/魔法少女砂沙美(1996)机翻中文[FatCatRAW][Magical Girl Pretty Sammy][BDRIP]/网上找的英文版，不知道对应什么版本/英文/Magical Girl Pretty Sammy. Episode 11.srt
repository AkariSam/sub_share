00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:14,059
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,994
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:20,331
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,460
...tsukai you!

5
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,703
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:35,046
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:39,517
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:43,351
...demae niyatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:47,392
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:50,020
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:54,199
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,962
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,772
...genki ni nareruwa.

00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:04,376
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:14,318
...yume janai.

18
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:35,468
The egg attack from Chicken Girl!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

19
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,473
It may be sudden,
but Pretty Sammy's here!

20
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:47,946
A kid with the shell still
on her butt?! How cheeky!

21
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,054
How rude! I don't have
anything like that on my bum!

22
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:55,520
What about you?! That's a rooster comb!
You're supposed to be Chicken GIRL...!

23
00:01:55,594 --> 00:01:57,221
Huh?!

24
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,221
Some nerve, bringing up a girl's
sore spot, you bad kid!

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,961
I'll teach you!!

26
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:06,396
Pretty Coquettish Bomber!

27
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:12,066
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

28
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:18,806
Oh, can't waste them!

29
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:20,852
All right! We'll have
rice omelets tonight!

30
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,552
Sammy, where's your baton?

31
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,556
Huh?

32
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:29,516
The Lost Baton

33
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,260
Ow!

34
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:35,300
What the heck?!!

35
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:44,536
This is Pretty Sammy's
magical baton...

36
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:51,516
Is it the real thing?

37
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:55,912
All right! I'll conquer the world!

38
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:58,356
Please don't do that.

39
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,654
Huh...?

40
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:02,694
Please don't do such
a terrible thing.

41
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:07,391
Oh, please don't run away.

42
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,901
Huh?

43
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:13,802
I am the magical baton
of justice.

44
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:18,002
So please use me
to further world peace.

45
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:22,511
You mean if I fight for justice,
I'll be able to use magic?

46
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:23,570
Yes!

47
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:27,110
Then I'm gonna be a
magical girl, too!

48
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:29,380
Okay! Please do your best!

49
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:35,315
What luck!!

50
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:37,589
- Rumiya!
- So we're gonna do it?

51
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:39,195
Of course!

52
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:41,562
If this isn't the greatest
opportunity, then what is?!

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,232
Let's just forget about it, Sis.

54
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:46,998
We're bound to fail again.

55
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,199
Something awful's happened, Ramia!

56
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,573
Sasami's lost her magical baton!

57
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:55,813
Oh, my! That's a real shame!

58
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:02,148
But it'll work out fine! Just
leave things to Sasami, okay?

59
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:05,923
Wonderful!

60
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:08,221
We'd just run out of eggs.

61
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,284
Mom, I'm going out for a bit!

62
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:11,989
Oh, Sasami...!

63
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:15,964
Wasn't she going with Misao today...?

64
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:27,435
There's some cheesecake in
the fridge, so take it along.

65
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,938
You'll share it with Sasami, okay?

66
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:33,017
Thanks, Mom.

67
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:37,618
Sasami!

68
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,233
Sasami...

69
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,804
The brakes...!

70
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:59,000
A bank robber!

71
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,971
The gas station's on fire!

72
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:05,448
Um...

73
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:08,850
...terrible things seem to be
happening all around.

74
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:13,915
Isn't it time to transform to
the magical girl of justice?

75
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:18,554
A magical girl won't come
out for little things like that!

76
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,564
Oh, is that right...?

77
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,802
Ah! Look at that!

78
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,866
A meteorite's falling
from the sky!

79
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,839
If only a magical girl
would come and save us!

80
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,068
Just what I was thinking!

81
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,037
Now this situation is more
fitting for a magical girl!

82
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:39,111
Transform!
Ting, jing, ting-a-lingle-ling!

83
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:42,245
Magical Girl Funky Connie!

84
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,948
Here goes nothing!

85
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:12,608
You townsfolk can
thank me, Funky Connie!

86
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:15,278
Boy, that was a close call!

87
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,583
W-Was it, though?

88
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,886
Ooh!

89
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:25,160
Hiroto! Imagine, meeting here!
It must've been in the stars!

90
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,899
What's that?! Who are you?!

91
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,829
Geez, don't be so shy!

92
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:33,330
I know!

93
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:37,771
If I'm fighting for world peace,
I've got to get happier, first!

94
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,499
She sure seems cheery!

95
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:41,546
She seems kinda familiar...

96
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,647
Come with me!

97
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:45,649
World peace exists in
being with my darling!

98
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:49,175
I can't figure it out! But you
sound a lot like someone I know...!

99
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,823
WHO IS IT...?!!

100
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:54,380
It's not here.

101
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:57,758
I'm sure it would've been
blown somewhere around here...

102
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:02,657
I know! Ryo-Ohki, take a sniff of me,
then search for the baton!

103
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,798
Well?

104
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,074
Smells like a baby.

105
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:13,007
Get looking!!

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,872
Ting, jing, ting-a-lingle-ling!

107
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:34,021
Our beautiful castle of love!

108
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:36,329
Hey! Untie me!

109
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,733
Ooh, you even look good
when you're angry!

110
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:41,567
Get rid of this freaky house
of ghouls, too!

111
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,200
Or else we won't be able to
play dodge ball tomorrow!

112
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:46,073
Stop being bashful!

113
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:48,635
I understand.
I'll take the strings...

114
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:52,740
...from around your heart!

115
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,711
Ting, jing, ting-a-lingle-ling!

116
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:01,548
It's the ROPES
I want you to undo!

117
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,218
Oh, that's strange...

118
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:04,428
Ting...!

119
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:05,326
It's you...

120
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,056
Jing...!

121
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:06,893
...that's...

122
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:07,829
Ting-a-lingle-ling!

123
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,526
...strange!!

124
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:16,130
Hang in there, my darling!

125
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,373
Magical Girl Funky Connie.

126
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,349
My beloved...

127
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:33,285
WORLD PEACE IS HERE!!!

128
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:58,446
Mom made this cheesecake.

129
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:03,209
She made it for the two
of us to have together.

130
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:07,484
I was going to meet Sasami...

131
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:14,625
We'd promised each other
to hang around, today.

132
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:20,800
I don't want to be alone...

133
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,234
Huh? This is my house.

134
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:28,312
How come...?

135
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,780
Because I picked up
your scent here.

136
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:35,919
Oh, brother!

137
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:39,720
Yes-sir-ee! I'm a cake!

138
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,783
I'm Cheesecake Girl,
the Love-love Monster!

139
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:46,095
- A monster!!
- Why now, of all times!!

140
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:47,131
Then it must be...!

141
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:50,690
That face is the face
of someone in trouble.

142
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,660
- I knew it!
- Pixy Misa!

143
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:57,232
You're definitely in trouble!
Because you've lost your magical baton!!

144
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,275
How do you know?!

145
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,106
Unreal! Right on the mark!

146
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:03,677
How ridiculous that the
person who's my rival...

147
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:05,841
...would lose her precious baton.

148
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:07,844
Here.

149
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,744
My baton!!

150
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,585
You dropped it over there.

151
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:16,354
If my rival Sammy isn't around,
there's nobody to compete with.

152
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:21,199
Thank you! You don't look it,
but you're actually a good person!

153
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,633
- All right! Transform, Sasami!
- Uh-huh!

154
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,895
Pretty Mutation...

155
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,508
...Magical Recall!

156
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:33,411
Hey...

157
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:34,844
Customer Appreciation Gift

158
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:38,181
What's this?! It's a fake!!

159
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,118
Now you're not Pretty Sammy!

160
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:44,178
You're Pretty Monster!

161
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:48,225
That's awful!! You tricked me!!

162
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,752
You fool! You FOOL!
You're such a fool!

163
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,321
How could I know where
your baton is?!

164
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,135
And even if I did,
I wouldn't be telling you!

165
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:02,333
Okay, Cheesecake Girl! Start
spreading cheese all over the city!

166
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:04,375
Roger! Yes-sir-ee!

167
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:07,671
Yes-sir-ee!

168
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:20,391
Sasami! What's gonna happen?!

169
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:22,860
Well, first of all, this
cheese is pretty good!

170
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,536
Oh, my cherished dream!

171
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:44,582
Dancing with Hiroto like this.

172
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:47,184
Aah! I'm too happy!!

173
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:51,778
You shouldn't waste food
like this!!

174
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:54,518
Put that moral issue aside and
worry about saving our lives!

175
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:59,920
Aah! I'm too happy!!

176
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:03,892
La-di-da-dee-la-di-da!

177
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:07,833
Oh! We're getting washed away!!

178
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:12,005
Oh, my. Looks like
Sammy's in real trouble.

179
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:15,869
Hey, Hiroto...?

180
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:17,505
What is it, Connie?

181
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:20,080
What do you like about me?

182
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:21,709
Everything, of course!

183
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:31,017
Gee, Hiroto!

184
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,491
So?

185
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:36,932
You were looking for something
and this is what happened?

186
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,398
Well, what did you lose?

187
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,904
Uh... my magical baton...

188
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,774
Um... I mean something
I can't mention!

189
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,809
Whatever. We'll use the genius
Washu's scientific affection...

190
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:58,685
...and look into that
lost item of yours.

191
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,987
Huh?

192
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:08,529
The thing we're looking
for is at the school!

193
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,034
- Yes, Professor!
- Is it really?!!

194
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,508
Yes-sir-ee!

195
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:20,203
Gotta hurry!

196
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:25,949
We're almost at the school!

197
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:28,147
Kawai!

198
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:30,115
Oyamada!

199
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:33,555
I'm a goner, for sure!

200
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,719
Hang on, Oyamada!
I'll save you in a flash!

201
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:39,153
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Go!

202
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:45,626
I met you in grade two, Hiroto.

203
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,870
I was being chased by a bear.

204
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,501
You kicked a soccer ball
at him and drove him away!

205
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,371
I did?

206
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:57,505
You were so cool, then.

207
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:01,075
You've been my prince
ever since then, Hiroto.

208
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:06,788
- Hey, Hiroto?
- Yeah?

209
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,663
I love you, Connie.

210
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:15,992
Don't call me that!

211
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,959
Call me Konoha.

212
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:20,995
Konoha...?

213
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:24,439
But you're Magical Girl
Funky Connie, right?

214
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:27,377
I'm Konoha! Ko-no-ha!

215
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,379
Who's this Konoha person?

216
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,473
Man! There!

217
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,085
Huh?

218
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,217
Now you know. Right, Hiroto?

219
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,358
Who are you? Never
seen you before.

220
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,028
What?

221
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:48,657
Connie! Where'd you go, Connie?

222
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,331
Oh, my beloved Connie!

223
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:53,570
Couldn't be...

224
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,142
Connie! There you are!

225
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,078
Connie! Where are you?!

226
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,510
Connie! I've been looking for you!

227
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:05,116
Connie!

228
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:05,980
Where are you? Connie!

229
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,044
Connie!

230
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:12,456
Connie, come on out!

231
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:14,013
Oh, no!!

232
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:17,619
Hiroto doesn't love me;
he loves Connie...!

233
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,858
Connie? You in here?

234
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:22,558
If that's the case...

235
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,494
...what's the point of
being magical?!!

236
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,137
Excuse me...

237
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:30,834
What do YOU want?!

238
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:34,703
I hate to interrupt you
at a busy time like this...

239
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:37,413
...but the city's in big trouble.

240
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,042
So could you get to work
for the sake of justice?

241
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:42,681
SHUT UP!

242
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:45,484
Who cares about this "trouble"?!
Who cares about "justice"?!

243
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:47,547
Gosh, those are tough questions...

244
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,252
I'VE BEEN MORTALLY
WOUNDED, HERE!!

245
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,892
Oh, my!!

246
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,629
Sasami!!

247
00:15:58,703 --> 00:15:59,260
Huh?

248
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,410
M-My baton...!

249
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:10,208
I can't believe it;
it's the real thing!!

250
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:11,609
Can you tell?

251
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:14,446
I put a mark on it,
just in case!

252
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,146
A mark?

253
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:19,118
Genuine

254
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,588
Couldn't you think
of something else...?

255
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,719
But... Who called me just now?

256
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:29,233
- I did.
- Oh, I get it!

257
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,098
I'm so glad I made it back to you.

258
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,170
Please don't be alarmed.

259
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:41,109
I have an independent thought
circuit in case I'm ever lost.

260
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,712
You didn't know...?

261
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:47,580
I forgot...

262
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:50,120
Anyway! Transform into
Pretty Sammy!

263
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,155
Okay!

264
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,721
Pretty Mutation...

265
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,261
...Magical Recall!

266
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:15,645
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

267
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:19,308
Yes-sir-ee! Yes-sir-ee!
Sticky cheese-ee!

268
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:23,620
With this much cheese
flowing around...

269
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:25,986
...Pretty Monster must be at the
Pacific Ocean right about now!

270
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,788
Sorry to disappoint you!

271
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,828
That's as far as you'll get!

272
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:34,654
Pretty Sammy! But what?!
How?! Why?!

273
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:38,259
I can't quite figure it out,
but I've got my baton back!

274
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:40,433
And now I'm-a-comin'!

275
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:46,209
Smear Sammy with cheese and wash her
all the way to Papua New Guinea!

276
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,245
Roger! Yes-sir-ee!!

277
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,718
Ooh, this is gonna be great!!

278
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,483
I cannot hit her! No-sir-ee!

279
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:00,589
Misa, you were really mean
to me back there!

280
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:02,421
I'll return the favor, threefold!!

281
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,560
Sammy! Use the lethal technique!

282
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,256
Gotcha!

283
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,900
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

284
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:19,039
I'm a cheesecake!

285
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,705
A sweet cheesecake, yes sir!

286
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,379
- You did it, Sammy!
- Count on me!

287
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:31,113
Remember this, Sammy!
Next time will be the end of you!

288
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:33,089
Aah! She ran away again!

289
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,918
Way to go, Sammy!

290
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:38,393
And I got me some new data!
What luck!

291
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:51,241
What a relief!

292
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,643
For a while there, I was worried.
But Pretty Sammy pulled through, again!

293
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:56,611
Yeah, right.

294
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:58,672
- Sammy's incredible!
- Yeah, right.

295
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:01,149
- Sammy's so cute!
- Yeah, right.

296
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,653
- Sammy's so wonderful!
- Yeah, right.

297
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,712
And I'm the queen.

298
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,621
NOT YET!!!

299
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:09,319
Yeah, right.

300
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:13,289
I was worried,
for a while there.

301
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:15,161
Don't you ever lose your
baton again, all right?

302
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,530
Okay.

303
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:21,731
Sasami...

304
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:23,239
Misao.

305
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:26,674
Oh! We were supposed to
hang around today!

306
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:30,578
I'm really sorry! Something
came up, all of a sudden.

307
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,183
Forgive me?

308
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,185
Sure!

309
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,979
Mom made us a cake.
Let's have it, together.

310
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:41,524
Uh-huh!

311
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,755
Cheesecake...!!

312
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:50,695
Isn't it good, Sasami?

313
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,395
Y-Yeah, right.

314
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:02,108
Here's a special bonus for you,
Ryo-Ohki. A double helping!

315
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:06,475
Gotta finish them off, Ryo-Ohki.

316
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,311
Come on, Sasami.
Have some more.

317
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,823
Oh... yeah, sure.

318
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,859
There's still lots more.

319
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:18,895
My mom made it, special.

320
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,867
Hiroto!

321
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:25,458
Wait up, Hiroto!

322
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,200
Quit bugging me, Haida!

323
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,706
I know how you really feel!

324
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:32,702
What are you talking about?!

325
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:36,304
Come on! Wait for me, Hiroto!
Don't be a stranger!

326
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,348
- Some things never change, huh?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,885
Oh, Hiroto!

328
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:45,149
Je t'aime!

329
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:50,555
Kawai!

330
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:55,633
I'm a goner, for sure!!

331
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,361

00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:29,424
I meet him on the way
home from shopping.

349
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:32,189
He seems serious, but
he's got some worries.

350
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,026
I want to do something to help.

351
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:37,333
Coming next: The Blue Sky Rangers.

352
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:40,369
The taste of tears
is a little salty.
