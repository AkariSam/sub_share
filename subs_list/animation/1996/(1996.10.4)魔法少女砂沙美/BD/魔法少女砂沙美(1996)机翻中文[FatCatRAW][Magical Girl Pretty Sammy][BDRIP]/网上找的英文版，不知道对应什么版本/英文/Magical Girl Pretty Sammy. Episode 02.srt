1
00:00:01,957 --> 00:00:04,892
I'm Sasami, your average,
happy fourth grader.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,625
One day, a strange lady
with magical powers came.

3
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:12,599
I want you to be "Pretty Sammy,"
a magical girl...

4
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,398
...and I want you to restore
world peace.

5
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:17,404
Unbelievable!

6
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:20,169
Of course I said "no"!

7
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:24,436
But then this weird girl showed up.

8
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:27,505
I have a bad feeling about this!

9
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:30,652
That's right!

10
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:35,612
The Crash Course

11
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:38,119
Hello, all you people out there!

12
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:40,684
It's been a week since we met.

13
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:42,457
Sorry to keep you.

14
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:45,733
My name is...

15
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:50,434
...Pixy Misa!

16
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,201
Pixy Misa?

17
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:55,243
Okay. Strike the set.

18
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:59,573
It's a pleasure, Sasami.

19
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,651
Anyway, here's the CD
you ordered.

20
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:10,257
Why'd you do that?

21
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:14,591
It was just a pretext to get
you over here. A little joke.

22
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,327
What I really wanted...

23
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:20,163
...was you, Sasami!

24
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:21,725
Who, me?

25
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:26,331
Yes! I'll use my magic and give
you something to cry over.

26
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:28,610
Why would you do that?

27
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,105
Want to know?

28
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:33,505
Then I'll tell you...

29
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,573
Not!

30
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,315
What the heck?!

31
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:38,512
Sasami!

32
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:44,459
Who's she?

33
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:46,357
Me?

34
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:51,297
I'm called Magical Girl Pixy Misa.

35
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:52,492
Magical girl?

36
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:54,001
Precisely.

37
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:56,003
Why's a magical girl here?

38
00:01:56,605 --> 00:02:00,268
You want to know, too?
Then I'll tell you...

39
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:01,969
Not!

40
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:04,445
What was that?!

41
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,306
All right.
Since you're both here...

42
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:10,146
...I might as well
give you a flashy show.

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,419
Calling Mystics!

44
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,616
Come on, baby!

45
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,584
Love-love Monster
CD Girl

46
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:50,056
Come on, come on, come on!

47
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:52,689
The CD turned into a girl!

48
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:55,021
It's a Love-love Monster!

49
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:56,530
What's that?

50
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,466
A monster created by focusing
evil magic energy on an object.

51
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:03,404
That's the Love-love Monster.

52
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:08,470
Yes, yes, yes. Thanks for
that simple explanation.

53
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,105
CD Girl, show them how
grateful you are!

54
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:16,084
Everybody dance!

55
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:23,614
That's dangerous!

56
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,125
It is?

57
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:27,161
Good, I'm glad.

58
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:29,589
Fire away!

59
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:31,929
Shall we dance?

60
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:36,304
Look out!

61
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,431
Hey!

62
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:41,600
Stop!

63
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:43,975
Sasami! There's only one choice!

64
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:45,877
What's that?

65
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,915
Become Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

66
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:50,184
Why'd you stop?

67
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:52,882
All sold out.

68
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:57,253
Out of ammo? Oh, well.

69
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:00,251
We'll recharge.

70
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,296
All right.

71
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:10,072
Now's your chance, Sasami!

72
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:10,902
But...

73
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,599
Sasami!

74
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,510
I have to get the CD back anyway.

75
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,581
Just this once.

76
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:25,951
Okay! Transform into Pretty Sammy!

77
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,659
Now I'm desperate!

78
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:36,497
I forgot the words.

79
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,396
Pretty Mutation...

80
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,934
Oh, yeah.

81
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,500
Pretty Mutation...

82
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:49,069
...Magical Recall!

83
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,449
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

84
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:10,431
Not so fast. Watch your back!

85
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:13,900
That's not fair, attacking
someone while they're posing!

86
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:15,533
Fool!

87
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:19,131
You're spoiled and don't
deserve to be my rival.

88
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:22,504
Stand up and fight me!

89
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:24,568
You kicked me down!

90
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:27,873
That's another matter.

91
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,544
CD Girl.
Stand by for your encore.

92
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:37,291
Not fair!

93
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:41,829
Say what you like. You're
the one that was tricked.

94
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:44,297
Dance reprise!

95
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:51,765
Same as before the
transformation.

96
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:54,371
Quit gawking and help me out!

97
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,741
What do I do?

98
00:05:57,045 --> 00:06:00,208
Sammy, you can't use any
magical powers yet.

99
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,579
Yeah, well I don't know
any, so I can't help it!

100
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:07,349
But you should be physically
stronger since you transformed.

101
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,680
I'll win if I fight back?

102
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:12,124
Yeah! Attacking is the best defense!

103
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:13,786
Okay!

104
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,626
Sammy Tackle!

105
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:20,862
Sammy!

106
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:24,296
That didn't work.

107
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:28,606
Sammy's such a fool!

108
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:32,609
I can't believe it didn't work.

109
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,709
Good-bye!

110
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,751
Stop, CD Girl!

111
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,545
What?

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,554
I'm disappointed in you, Sammy.

113
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:45,757
Especially after she told
me you were my rival.

114
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,253
Who's "she"?

115
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,061
You're a little girl who doesn't
even know how to use magical powers.

116
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:55,569
I should just finish you off
right here and now.

117
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:57,628
But that would be boring.

118
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,537
Go get some training!

119
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:00,632
Training?

120
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,338
Yes! We'll have our rematch
in 3 hours.

121
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,343
I can't get trained
in just 3 hours!

122
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,351
But I am pretty busy
these days.

123
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:14,779
Well, see you here in 3 hours!

124
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,457
If you run away, CD Girl
will destroy the whole town.

125
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:23,030
Hang on!

126
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:25,066
See you again.

127
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,367
They're gone.

128
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:37,201
Now what do I do?

129
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,676
Sammy, in this case...

130
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,313
Yeah?

131
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:44,352
Get that training!

132
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,852
R-really...?

133
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:56,921
Excellent!

134
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:59,060
Wonderful!

135
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,492
Who could that other
magical girl be?

136
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:05,206
I can't imagine.

137
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,704
But Sasami transformed into
Pretty Sammy after all.

138
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:11,075
She'll be fine.

139
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:13,046
Hi, Tsunami.

140
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,050
Ramia.

141
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,714
They've started deliberating
over your rule as queen.

142
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:25,419
Yes. But an evil magical girl
has appeared on the earth.

143
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,396
It's just a feeling but...

144
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:32,660
...maybe someone's trying to
interfere with the deliberations.

145
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:34,859
What do you think?

146
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:36,301
I doubt it.

147
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:40,307
You're right. I guess
I'm just a worrywart.

148
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,774
Must be a coincidence.

149
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:43,811
That's right, a coincidence.

150
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,583
Fool.

151
00:08:56,825 --> 00:09:00,352
Why are we at school, when
I'm supposed to be training?

152
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,293
It has the equipment,
and it's convenient.

153
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:04,594
There's no time; we must hurry.

154
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,469
But everybody will laugh
if they see me like this.

155
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:13,633
No problem. You're not Sasami now,
you're Pretty Sammy.

156
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,067
Yeah?

157
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:17,941
Okay, Sammy, start with 10 laps.

158
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,605
Huh?!

159
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,150
Here goes!

160
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:27,981
What're you doing?
Hurry up and pass it.

161
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,990
Who's that girl?

162
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,728
It's not our school uniform.

163
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:36,996
Hey, you! Hey!

164
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,358
You aren't from our school.

165
00:09:42,637 --> 00:09:45,435
They don't recognize me.

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,331
Well, uh, I'm...

167
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:51,402
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

168
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:57,511
What's a magical girl like you
doing in a place like this?

169
00:09:57,886 --> 00:09:59,786
Well...

170
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:01,981
Practicing some techniques.

171
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:06,087
Sorry! Got to run! Bye!

172
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:10,658
What was that...?

173
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,571
Oh, I'm so elegant.

174
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:20,434
Misa. Hey, Misa.

175
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:21,941
Rumiya.

176
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,978
My sister's on the phone.

177
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:27,240
Hello, Misa speaking.

178
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:30,211
Haven't you finished
Sammy off yet, Misa?

179
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,218
She'll be an easy knock out,
2 hours from now. Wait and see.

180
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:40,486
Sounds promising.
Don't let me down.

181
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:42,189
Okay. Bye.

182
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:46,233
Your sister worries too much.

183
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,873
Can we really count on her...?

184
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:58,742
You can do it!
I'll always watch over you.

185
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:01,681
That's not fair!

186
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:06,985
Any connection between
chin-ups and magic?

187
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:08,682
Who knows.

188
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,719
Misa. Misa.

189
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:15,920
Wake up.

190
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:17,897
Morning, Rumiya.

191
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,561
Forget the greetings.
You'd better go finish off Sammy.

192
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:25,128
What, already?
I don't feel like it.

193
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,436
What?! Get going.

194
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,306
CD Girl.

195
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:36,608
Will you go knock down Sammy
for me? I'll be here napping.

196
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,015
Okay.

197
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:41,180
Misa! Aren't you going to
fight her yourself?

198
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:43,888
Changed my mind.

199
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,518
That's your excuse?!

200
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:48,323
Rumiya.

201
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:51,058
I don't need excuses
for my behavior.

202
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,658
Fun is what matters.

203
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:57,703
Enjoy! And exciting!

204
00:11:57,772 --> 00:12:00,673
Those are the principles
that guide my behavior.

205
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,102
Exactly like my sister Ramia.

206
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,674
It's so high!

207
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:15,922
What's she doing?

208
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,026
She's magic, all right.

209
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:22,053
Have courage! The kind of
courage to overcome any fear!

210
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,425
It's so dangerous.

211
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:27,195
Never try this at home, kids.

212
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:29,532
Hey! What are you doing?

213
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,672
It's against school rules
to stand on handrails!

214
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,743
Who are you?

215
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

216
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,918
Even magical girls have to
obey school rules.

217
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:49,183
Get off there!

218
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:50,781
But my training!

219
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:53,656
Go to the mountains or the sea.

220
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:01,895
Time's up!

221
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:04,837
Sorry, got to run!

222
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:08,708
Go on a diet!

223
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,174
It's almost time. Ready?

224
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,048
I'm pooped.

225
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:21,350
That training will increase
your tolerance to magic.

226
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,620
Now you can use the
Pretty Coquettish Bomber.

227
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:25,989
What's that?

228
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,824
The technique that'll finish
off the Love-love Monster!

229
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,027
She's here!

230
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:38,637
Where's Misa?

231
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,139
You are very weak!

232
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,644
Misa's enjoying a lovely vacation.

233
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,602
How dare she!

234
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,074
This is your chance to
get rid of the monster!

235
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:51,275
Say your prayers!

236
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:55,049
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy
will finish you off!

237
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:57,091
Come on, guitar!

238
00:13:58,293 --> 00:13:59,783
Fire!

239
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,621
You didn't do that before!

240
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,099
Encore! Encore!

241
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,664
Fire, fire, fire!

242
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:13,969
Sammy! Use the Pretty
Coquettish Bomber!

243
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,076
How do I do that?

244
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,646
Concentrate your magic
on the baton!

245
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:23,343
How can I concentrate
at a time like this?

246
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:26,619
Wonder what she was up to?

247
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:29,213
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy?

248
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,815
There's no such thing as...!

249
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:38,689
What's happening?

250
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,825
The magical girl!

251
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,693
What?

252
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:45,533
Run, you two!

253
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:52,279
I've got to save them!

254
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,178
Fire!

255
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:58,319
Sammy!

256
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,124
All right!

257
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:28,182
Misa! Look at that!

258
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,878
Huh?

259
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:37,154
What's this?

260
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,159
It's called the Pretty Space.

261
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,957
This is her magic.

262
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:44,088
Better than I imagined.

263
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:46,061
Oh, my god!

264
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:48,130
Now, Sammy!

265
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:49,032
Okay.

266
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,642
Converge, magic powers of justice!

267
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:02,847
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

268
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,532
I'm exhausted!

269
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:26,198
You used your energy
all at once.

270
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:28,242
You must learn to control it.

271
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,471
The CD!

272
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,779
Covered in scratches.

273
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,216
No one will buy it.

274
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:41,878
You really are magic!

275
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,893
I can't believe a monster
like that was here.

276
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:51,398
I hope you'll keep on
protecting our town!

277
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,828
Wha...? S-sure...

278
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,965
Anyway, see you later.

279
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,910
Bye.

280
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,841
Thanks, Sammy.

281
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,480
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

282
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:14,487
She's unreal! She's so cool!

283
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:25,025
What am I doing here?

284
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:37,944
A bird...

285
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:44,846
You did it, Sammy.

286
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,546
It can't be...

287
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:50,387
I was a little surprised when
that evil magical girl showed up.

288
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,450
But that kindred spirit of mine
was wonderful.

289
00:17:54,996 --> 00:17:59,057
You can do it, Pretty Sammy!
Make the world a peaceful place.

290
00:18:01,102 --> 00:18:02,865
What's the matter, Ramia?

291
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,405
Darn it!

292
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:15,182
How vexing!

293
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:19,077
Who can I take my anger out on?!

294
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,516
Who can I take it out on?!

295
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,021
Hi, Sis. I messed up.

296
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,195
You'll do.

297
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,907
Misao.

298
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,870
What's wrong?

299
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:46,812
Just a little stiff.

300
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:50,578
But I won't be a magical girl
ever again.

301
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:52,318
What's that?

302
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,786
Nothing. Let's go.

303
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:02,596
The cat from yesterday.

304
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:07,461
What? I got rid of that
stupid monster; it's over.

305
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:10,333
No way. Pixy Misa's around.

306
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:13,066
There's lots to do;
you're just getting started.

307
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,509
Sasami?

308
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:19,103
It's nothing at all!

309
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:26,011
I'm in for a rough ride.
