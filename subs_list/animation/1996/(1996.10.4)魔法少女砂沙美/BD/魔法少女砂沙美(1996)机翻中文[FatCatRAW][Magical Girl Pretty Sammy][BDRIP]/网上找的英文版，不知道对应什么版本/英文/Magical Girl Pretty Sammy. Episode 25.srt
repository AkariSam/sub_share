1
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,823
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:16,690
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,119
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:23,190
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:32,467
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,810
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:39,280
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:43,114
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:47,156
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,784
...I flop out.

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,929
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,692
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:00,536
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:04,106
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,870
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:10,576
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,040
...is more than just a dream.

00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:35,961
I'm your totally UNaverage
grade 4 student...

20
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:38,939
...Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!
There have been some obstacles...

21
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:44,105
...but I tried my best and could
restore the balance of Gemini!

22
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:45,942
Nice going, Sammy!

23
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,916
Which makes Tsunami the
queen of the magical kingdom!

24
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,319
Or at least, it should have.

25
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:56,050
The magical kingdom of Juraihelm
will destroy the Earth.

26
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:59,786
That's right. Romio, a strange woman
with magical powers appeared...

27
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:03,223
...and used magical cannons to
push the Earth toward the sun!

28
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,028
- And...!
- Birdie...

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,934
Sammy, you've gotta help us!
Romio has conquered Juraihelm!

30
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,996
Sammy, you've gotta go to
Juraihelm to save the Earth!

31
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:15,043
But I can't get to outer space.

32
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,877
No problem! We've got my secretly
manufactured rocket for solar probing!

33
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,017
Leave it to me; I'll operate it!

34
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:26,054
This is how things began.
I ended up traveling to Juraihelm...

35
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:28,021
...to save the Earth.

36
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,990
So you came, Pretty Sammy.

37
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,186
However, "Put something
away for a rainy day."

38
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:36,364
It was all very confusing,
but this is how it turned out!

39
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,064
Finally, we've arrived
one step away from the climax!

40
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:45,038
New Technology

41
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,302
This is the magical kingdom...?

42
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,706
But it used to be a beautiful
world, covered in flowers!

43
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,946
It's exactly like hell, now!

44
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:55,074
How come?

45
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,778
I can only think that it's because
the magical powers disappeared.

46
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,988
Ryo-Ohki, what does that...

47
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,125
Wh-What?!!

48
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:10,791
Who... Who the heck are you?

49
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:13,562
What are you talking about?
It's me, Ryo-Ohki!

50
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:15,569
Ryo-Ohki?!

51
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:19,005
Oh, yeah! You've never
seen me like this before.

52
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,309
This is what I really look like.

53
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,269
No way.

54
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,312
It's true, I tell you!

55
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,811
Then who did I used
to kiss good night?!

56
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:33,781
Me.

57
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:37,223
Then who scoffed my cake
and ate it behind my back?!

58
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,288
Might have been me.

59
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:41,522
And who came in the
bathtub with me...?

60
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,565
Uh, was that me...?

61
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,122
Gee whiz!

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,100
That's mean, Sammy!

63
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,467
But I didn't know...

64
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:51,563
...that you weren't really a cat!!

65
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,373
I had to be, or else your family
wouldn't have taken me in!

66
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,538
Yeah, that might be, but still...!

67
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:03,778
If a boy suddenly moved in,
the neighbors would be shocked.

68
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:10,592
Anyway, forget about that! We've
gotta make sure Tsunami's all right!

69
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,790
I'm sure she's inside
that tower over there!

70
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:15,125
Come on!

71
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:17,358
Huh? Well, uh...

72
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:19,560
The Earth's in trouble! Come on!

73
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:25,700
You don't show any
sign of being nervous.

74
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,769
But I must say, you're
a nice-looking couple.

75
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:32,280
I'll give the two of you
a nice present.

76
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,657
Intruders?

77
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,862
You're all very entertaining.

78
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,899
I am a pretty magical girl!

79
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:04,275
I'm the magical girl
who's gonna save Sammy!

80
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,644
And they call me...
And they call me...

81
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,983
Pixy Misa!

82
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:12,287
Uh, Misa. Could you be
a little more serious here?

83
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,187
Don't worry, Rumiya!
Now that I'm here...

84
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,817
...the problems will
be perfectly solved!

85
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,887
I wonder about that.

86
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,229
We're under attack!

87
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:32,705
Okay! Hard to starboard!!

88
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,674
Huh? In that case...

89
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:39,043
...hard to port!!

90
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,677
Oh, boy. I think we're in for it.

91
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,877
You were too relaxed!
That's why we're in this mess!!

92
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:58,666
The magical powers here
have completely vanished.

93
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,997
Why did this happen?

94
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,900
What a mess.

95
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,633
Yeah. This building was
built a long time ago.

96
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:08,198
It was preserved by
magical powers.

97
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:11,405
So when the magic disappeared,
the building became decrepit.

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,608
It's like Cinderella's
pumpkin carriage.

99
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,181
Looking at this, I can
understand what Tsunami said.

100
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,679
About there being no future
for the magical kingdom...

101
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,088
...unless the spiritual culture
and materialistic culture joined...

102
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:25,126
...to make a better place.

103
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,826
There's a stairway over here.
Let's go.

104
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,488
Sure, Ryo.

105
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:33,399
"Ryo?" What gives? You
always call me "Ryo-Ohki."

106
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:35,595
Uh, it's nothing!

107
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:40,104
It just didn't feel right,
that's all.

108
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:41,999
Snap to it, Sammy!

109
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,409
There could be enemies nearby.

110
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,348
Hey, what are you
hitting me for?!

111
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,248
Because! Just because!

112
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,287
I don't get it...

113
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,653
A magical level of 2%...

114
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:01,018
Seems like somebody's stolen
this planet's magical power.

115
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:02,958
Is that possible?

116
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:05,300
Yeah, it is.

117
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:09,802
If we don't hurry and get
this to Sammy somehow...

118
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,407
...the Earth's just
not gonna make it.

119
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,083
It's boiling...

120
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,120
Hiroto!

121
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:28,413
Look, this is Felini's new design!

122
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,692
This is no time to show off.

123
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:35,954
Okay, boys and girls... Until Magical
Girl Pretty Sammy saves the world...

124
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:38,898
...let's do our best to study!

125
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,330
Okay!

126
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:43,837
Misa... Sammy... do a good job!

127
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,417
This is the magical shrine?

128
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,112
Huh?! Mistress Tsunami?

129
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,721
Mistress Tsunami! Are you okay?!

130
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:10,364
Did I scare you?

131
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,559
Quit fooling around
at a time like this!!

132
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,004
I'm glad you came, Sammy.

133
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,634
Tell us what happened,
Mistress Tsunami!

134
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,478
Well, actually...

135
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,447
I don't have a clue!

136
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,414
No way!

137
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:30,974
Our magic...

138
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,384
...it's been stolen.

139
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:33,580
Oryo!

140
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,852
You must have seen Romio
from the Earth.

141
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,685
That woman used a strange device...

142
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:43,663
...and sucked up all the
magical power on this planet.

143
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,862
Look at me; she's stolen
my magical powers, too.

144
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:48,903
I'm useless as a guard.

145
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:50,632
And that's the story, Sammy.

146
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:54,340
You must try to destroy
that strange device of hers.

147
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,308
So, you've decided to
join the conversation?

148
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,311
I'm so dizzy...

149
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:03,874
Please! You're the only ones whose
magical powers aren't stolen yet.

150
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,117
Hurry, before she finds
out you're here!

151
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:07,883
I've already found out!

152
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:09,048
That voice...!

153
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:11,217
Yes, it's me. Romio.

154
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:15,889
You can become sentimental
kangaroos there, in the shrine.

155
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,361
What's that mean?!

156
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,956
No meaning, of course!

157
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,365
Sammy!

158
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:23,832
There are too many of them!
Must get them in one swipe!

159
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:27,170
No problem! Converge,
magic powers of justice!

160
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,848
Pretty Coquettish Bomber!

161
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:44,184
Very impressive,
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.

162
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,721
However, what'll happen if
your magic is stolen?

163
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,389
Oh, no! Run, Sammy!

164
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,557
What...?

165
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,135
NT System, power up!

166
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,073
M-My magic...

167
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,112
It's disappearing!

168
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:08,546
My transformation wore off!

169
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,811
Sasami...

170
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:12,710
Ryo-Ohki! Hang in there!

171
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:14,756
Darn! Is this it for us?!

172
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,819
In this case, we can only
entrust our fate to the heavens.

173
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,719
I don't wanna do that!

174
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,560
That's right, Sasami.

175
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:26,897
We've got to use our own
strength to determine our fate!

176
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,931
Well? Think you can
escape from this?

177
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:39,176
It's stopped, Johnny.

178
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,607
What's stopped, Catherine?

179
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,617
Nothing's even happened.

180
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,210
Your average person can't sense it.

181
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,986
Sammy is no longer
her transformed self.

182
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:52,686
Oh, my! If it isn't the
dangerous teacher over there!

183
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,299
Pixy Misa! What're you doing here?!

184
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,303
Of course I'm here because
I came to save Sammy!

185
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,573
That's why!

186
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,342
They're going to crash.

187
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,619
Are you okay?

188
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:22,885
Thank you, Sasami's daddy-o!

189
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,023
Speaking of which, where is Sammy?

190
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,819
Actually, we got separated
from her on the way here.

191
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,196
Oh, my. That's a bad situation.

192
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,700
This is good timing.

193
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:35,793
Here, give this to Sammy, okay?

194
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:37,736
What? What is this thing?

195
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:39,774
My NT System!

196
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:52,253
You're treating me too harsh
for a grade four student!!

197
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:56,856
I'm a goner!

198
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,893
Sasami!

199
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,935
Are you okay, Sasami?

200
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:10,964
Ryo-Ohki!

201
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,531
Run, Sasami! I'll fight
these things off, somehow!

202
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,304
No way! I can't just leave you!

203
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,273
This is the end of Pretty Sammy.

204
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,675
I wish I had my magical powers.

205
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:25,811
My magical powers, so I can
rescue the people on Earth...

206
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,855
...and Tsunami and the others!

207
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,315
Sasami!

208
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,423
What?!

209
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,490
Sorry to keep you, Sasami!

210
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,998
Oh...?

211
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,440
That's...!

212
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:52,736
Fighter for justice,
friendship and love!

213
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,306
The pretty and wonderful
magical girl, Pixy Misa!

214
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:59,949
Pixy Lovely Fire!

215
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,225
Very nice!

216
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:08,160
Long time, hey, Sasami?

217
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:09,921
Pixy Misa!

218
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,660
Which means Misao...?
But how come?!

219
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:16,170
To help out a friend
in trouble, why else?

220
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,763
Misao! No...

221
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,364
...Misa. Thank you.

222
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:24,342
Anyway, who's that guy?

223
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,414
Oh, that's Rumiya!
We're just friends.

224
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,411
Couldn't you rephrase that
to something a little kinder?

225
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:36,356
Forget that little sissy bug.

226
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,289
Here's a present for you, Sammy!

227
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,753
What's this?

228
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,230
Let's start the message!

229
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,062
Listen up, Sammy!

230
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,897
That's the NT System.

231
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:52,599
I, genius that I am, researched
and researched Sammy's magic...

232
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:56,542
...input the data, and developed
this magic absorption system.

233
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:59,973
Absorption? But there is
no magic here anymore.

234
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,913
You're gonna attract it here!

235
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,443
Forget it; just stick my NT
System attachment on your baton!

236
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,789
Y-Yes!

237
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,759
The magic words are, "Magical Sign!"

238
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:13,759
Okay!

239
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:16,597
Magical Sign!

240
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:30,067
Crabbie is here!

241
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,943
Surfacing complete! We've
received Sasami's Magical Sign!

242
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:38,343
Yes! Prepare to initiate
the NT System!

243
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,615
Preparing to initiate
the NT System!

244
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,390
Magic flywheel commenced!

245
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:47,888
Magic reactor generation shifted
from idle to mid-power!

246
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:50,021
Magic compression ascending!

247
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,994
Magic emergency valve closed!

248
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:55,161
Magic inhalation device initiated!

249
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:59,002
Magic energy level shifted
from 80 to 100, 120!

250
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:01,668
Magic energy prepared to launch!

251
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:05,312
Magic target lock!
Magic cross gauge value 20!

252
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:08,607
Anti-magic shock,
anti-magic flash defense!

253
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:11,519
Final stage security
magic device released!

254
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,455
Magic launch!

255
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:28,996
An... An NT System?!

256
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:36,403
Wow! I'm surrounded by
a ton of magical energy!

257
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,779
Now's your chance, Sasami!
Transform!

258
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:43,584
Pretty Mutation...

259
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:46,216
...Magical Recall!

260
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:03,730
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy NT!

261
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:06,399
I've arrived in order
to save the universe!

262
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,833
I noticed something while
I was doing my research.

263
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,810
Magic is an incarnation
of people's souls.

264
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:16,612
A composite of
spirit and substance.

265
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,488
The "substance" is the
sincere heart of humans.

266
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:24,082
It responds to their thoughts and wishes,
and makes them a reality.

267
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,860
That's what magic's really about!

268
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:30,091
Come on, Sammy! Do whatever
it takes to get her!!

269
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,302
- Let's do battle, Sammy!
- Yeah!

270
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,805
Lovely Boomerang!

271
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,476
Pretty Dynamite!

272
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,545
Here goes, Sammy!

273
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,644
Pretty Home Run!

274
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,258
Nice batting!

275
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,926
W-Wow...

276
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,621
That Pretty Sammy
is very promising.

277
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,964
Victory for the magical girls!

278
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:10,968
They did it!

279
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:16,476
This has become quite the problem.

280
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:20,605
Seems someone has developed
an NT System just like mine.

281
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:25,575
However, I have discovered
one very big mistake.

282
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,888
Even though the magical
power is reserved...

283
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:30,618
...it'll all be over if
it's absorbed once more.

284
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,991
This has been Romio,
from Juraihelm.

285
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,355
Excuse me.

286
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,401
It's happening again!
The magic's being absorbed!

287
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:44,961
No problem!

288
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,531
Sammy, press the NT switch
on your attachment.

289
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,578
Huh? Okay...

290
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:54,476
What the heck?!

291
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,950
Professor Washu made it to
protect against the NT System.

292
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,509
It's an M Field...

293
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,680
It's an anti-NT System barrier!

294
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,683
Unreal!

295
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:08,895
Sorry! I feel so bad!

296
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:12,360
Forget it, just hurry to the
Autumn Hall, where Romio is!

297
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,334
Right! Ryo-Ohki, can you move?

298
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,100
Sure, I can.

299
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:18,035
And you, Misa?

300
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:19,937
Of course! I'm okay!

301
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:22,772
Follow me, Rumiya,
or I'll beat you up!

302
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,545
Gee, she could at least be
a little more gentle with me...

303
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:28,582
Hey! Wait for me!!

304
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,981
Ryo-Ohki! Which way
to the Autumn Hall?

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,582
That way!

306
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,145
What?!

307
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:36,986
What's happening?!

308
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,026
Look!

309
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,129
Catherine, what is that thing?!

310
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,498
A battleship...?

311
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,604
We're no match for that thing!

312
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:29,609
But we have to try!

313
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:33,010
The magic absorption device
has gotta be on that thing!

314
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:35,106
Yeah, and if we don't destroy that...

315
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,310
...there's no future for
Juraihelm or Earth.

316
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,287
Then it's simple!
Let's squash the thing!!

317
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,790
- Misa...
- Sammy! The Teleport!

318
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,827
Right!

319
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,821
- Pretty...
-...Teleport!

320
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:54,735
Do your best! Peace
in the universe is...

321
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,168
Peace in the universe
is resting with you.

322
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,208
Dizzy...

323
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:07,580
Still, looking at it up close...

324
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,051
It's so big and dangerous!
It's huge!

325
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:17,247
Welcome to my magic battleship!

326
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:19,693
Pretty Sammy... No...

327
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,959
Sasami Kawai!
My little sister.

328
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,425
Little sister?!!

329
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,365
What?! You are?!!

330
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,996
Little sister?! What
are you talking about?!!

331
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:40,273
Meanwhile...

332
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:47,014
Oh, my older sister
turned into a magical girl!

333
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:51,320
Eimi! Why did you turn
into a magical girl?!

334
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:54,259
I can't change back!
Quit bugging me!!

335
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,645
It maybe too late, saying this
after such a long time...

336
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:23,984
...but I was wrong.

337
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:32,231
To say there are any number
of guys out there...

338
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,703
...I should've known better.

339
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,402
Midnight,

340
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:44,574
Comes to anyone,

341
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,046
...not only to Cinderella.

342
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:56,523
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

343
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:03,296
...but I've made light
of the whole world.

344
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:11,237
To think that somehow things
would turn out all right...

345
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:15,935
...I should've known better.

346
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,253
Misa and I use our final magic in
order to save Juraihelm and the Earth!

347
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:35,887
Coming next:
Magical Victory!

348
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:40,098
Within the universe,
Sammy sees the tears of time.

349
00:22:41,305 --> 00:23:41,495
