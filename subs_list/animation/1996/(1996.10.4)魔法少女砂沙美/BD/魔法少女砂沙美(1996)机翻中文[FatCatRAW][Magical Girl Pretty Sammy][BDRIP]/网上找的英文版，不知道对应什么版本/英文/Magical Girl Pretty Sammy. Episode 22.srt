1
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,174
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:17,041
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:20,539
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,574
...tsukai you!

5
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,818
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:35,161
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:36,697 --> 00:00:39,632
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

8
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:43,466
...demae ni yatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:47,508
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:50,136
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:54,314
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,077
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,888
...genki ni nareruwa.

14
00:01:00,888 --> 00:01:04,491
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

15
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:07,255
Fushigi na chikara ga.

16
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,961
Yume mireba yume mo...

17
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:14,425
...yume janai.

18
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:47,592
Sasami. I mean, Sammy.

19
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:52,029
Thanks to you, Gemini's balance
has been restored.

20
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,131
Thank you so much.

21
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:59,205
The balance has now been restored
to its former position.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,877
The Queen's inauguration
will move into the final stage.

23
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,641
Yes.

24
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:06,811
But before that, there is
something we must talk about.

25
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:07,945
Oh?

26
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,955
The important secrets...

27
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:14,119
...of both the planet Earth,
and our planet, Juraihelm.

28
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:19,721
The Third Magical Girl is Coming!

29
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,459
Are you ready, Tsunami?

30
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:24,697
This is our Juraihelm.

31
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:26,466
And this is the Earth.

32
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,475
Long ago, they were twin planets.

33
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:30,511
What?!

34
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:31,068
Oh, my.

35
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:37,008
Over many years, the two planets
began taking their own courses.

36
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:42,521
Based on our spiritual culture,
Juraihelm developed magic.

37
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:46,652
The Earth advanced a
materialistic culture.

38
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,494
Magic on the Earth became obsolete.

39
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:52,555
And we became submerged
in our spiritual world.

40
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,569
But at the core of Juraihelm,
the plan to normalize...

41
00:02:56,637 --> 00:03:00,198
...the relationship between
the two planets has never died.

42
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,073
A spiritual culture and
a materialistic culture.

43
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:07,580
Only when they are side by side
can an ideal world be created.

44
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,944
We will now return to that universe.

45
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:15,182
We will return the Earth and Juraihelm
to their former state as twin planets.

46
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:16,687
What's that?!

47
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:18,384
Oh, my. Um...

48
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,392
Tsunami! As Queen...

49
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,658
...you shall represent us
as the first contact.

50
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,392
Tsunami! Tsunami!

51
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,559
Hello? Anyone there?

52
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:32,464
What are you doing?!

53
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,507
Huh?

54
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:37,703
Um, I think there might be a
little mouse under the floor.

55
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:40,146
Weren't you listening to us?

56
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,407
Well, um...

57
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,506
So, you weren't listening!

58
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,107
All right!

59
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:49,986
We'll explain it over and over
with magical slides and videos!

60
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:52,151
Okay.

61
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,120
Huh?

62
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,296
Oh, my.

63
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,667
Oh, my. Oh, my.

64
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:03,127
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!

65
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:10,675
That's no good, trying to
become twin planets again!

66
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,056
Rumiya...

67
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:28,117
What?!

68
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:32,496
I-It's not what it looks like!
This is just, uh...

69
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:36,002
...one of the thrilling phenomena
typical of adolescent boys.

70
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,934
It's really embarrassing...

71
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:42,442
It's over.
My youth. My life.

72
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:45,841
Tsunami... Tsunami became queen.

73
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,107
I'm nothing more than
a nameless pretty maid.

74
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:51,708
Sis. Aren't you over the
shock of it all, yet?

75
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:54,219
Well, I guess that's natural.

76
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,050
Hey, Joe!

77
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:56,646
Huh?

78
00:04:56,723 --> 00:05:00,056
Fight! Fight! Hey, hey!

79
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:01,287
Fight!

80
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:04,057
Your lightening-fast jab
has been reduced to this...!

81
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:09,224
But your feelings about becoming
queen are still smoldering.

82
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,969
Hey, hey! Fight! Fight!

83
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,204
Ha, ha, isn't this fun?

84
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:17,732
It'll be okay. Time will
heal those wounds.

85
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,140
I'll look after you until then.

86
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:26,378
I won't have to force Misao
to transform into Misa anymore.

87
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:27,715
Things have worked out
for the best.

88
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:29,517
I wonder about that.

89
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:31,147
Huh?

90
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:31,986
What?

91
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,219
Wh-Who are you?!

92
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,162
Sorry to interrupt you like this.

93
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,224
My name is Romio.

94
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:43,026
Romio...?

95
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:46,766
Yes! I was at the far end
of the line of candidates.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,104
Oh. So, what do you want?

97
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:53,203
I'd like to speak with
Ramia for just a bit.

98
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,239
Well, my sister's a bit
punch-drunk now...

99
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:58,413
Punch...

100
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,420
Oh, I see. What a shame.

101
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,747
It wouldn't take long...

102
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:05,350
Y-Yeah, but...

103
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,427
I implore you.

104
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:09,758
W-Well, I guess a few
minutes won't hurt.

105
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,092
Thanks very much.

106
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:14,958
Ramia. It's been a long time.

107
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,761
Who are you?

108
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:22,002
Romio, candidate to be queen.
Don't you remember me?

109
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,003
Huh...?

110
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:26,045
Look, remember this?

111
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:31,049
Okay, zoom in. Closer, closer.

112
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:34,479
Just a little closer.
A little more.

113
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:39,454
Okay, that's good.
See? There I am.

114
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,692
Doesn't look a thing like you.

115
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:45,698
Well, I've been through a lot,
too, you know.

116
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:46,733
But, even so...

117
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,360
- Ramia!
- Huh...? What?

118
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:52,369
I heard everything that
went on up until now...

119
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,169
...from below the trap door
I was sent down.

120
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,637
Hm, it's such a shame.

121
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:02,148
Tsunami's inauguration as queen
is practically a done deal.

122
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:04,114
Tsunami...

123
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:07,247
I've given this a lot of thought.

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,949
Wondering whether Tsunami is
really suited to be the queen.

125
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:15,090
In truth, I can't hide my concerns about
that flower-planting girl's personality.

126
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:18,020
Tsunami... Tsunami...

127
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,965
And then I thought...

128
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:24,333
"Well, in that case, who WOULD
be best suited as queen?"

129
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:27,999
Then it came to me!
Your face appeared before my eyes!

130
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,171
Queen...

131
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:31,232
Sis?

132
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,109
Strong! Intelligent! Stylish!

133
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,606
The way you take action.

134
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:39,083
Your indomitable spirit!
Your physical strength!

135
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,788
More vitality than necessary!

136
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:47,150
Ramia! You have everything it
takes to become the queen!

137
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:49,260
Queen!

138
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:52,492
The one who belongs in the
queen's throne is Y-O-U!

139
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,232
It's waiting for you!

140
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:59,568
It's completely wrong to let one
or two mistakes hold you back.

141
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:04,740
Ramia, the world exists
to kneel down before you!

142
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:07,646
The world exists... for me!

143
00:08:07,714 --> 00:08:09,477
S-Sis...!

144
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,516
Hey, what are you doing?

145
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:14,953
It's still not too late.
Take hold of the queen's throne!

146
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:18,715
Of course, I'll do everything
I can to assist you.

147
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,656
S-Sis...!

148
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,167
All right!!

149
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:36,001
Sis is turning back
into a wild beast again.

150
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,339
Calm down, Sis!

151
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:45,378
I'm back!!

152
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:49,149
Tsunami, do you think I'm
just gonna hand over the belt?!

153
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:53,557
Wonderful! That's more
like the real you!

154
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:56,027
- You said you're Romio, right?
- Right.

155
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:58,456
I wanna ask you just one thing.

156
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,862
Sure, anything.

157
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,902
Don't you think you'd like
to become queen yourself?

158
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:04,869
You were a candidate, right?

159
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:08,271
Who, me?
Out of the question, Ramia.

160
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,775
I've come to realize
my own limitations.

161
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:14,845
Someone as small-minded as I
could never make it as queen.

162
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:18,316
So all I want to do is become
a person to assist the queen.

163
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,979
Please think of me as,
"Queen Ramia's doggy"!

164
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,018
Well, I suppose it's only natural
to think that way...

165
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:30,324
...once you realize just
how talented I am.

166
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:32,092
You're exactly right.

167
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:33,860
Okay!!

168
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:38,030
Romio! Once I become queen,
I'll make you chief editor...

169
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:41,806
...of my fan club's "Ramia Monthly" newsletter!
"Mistress Ramia"

170
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,069
I'm honored.

171
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:44,906
So, anyway, what's your plan?

172
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:47,503
The balance has already been
restored, you know.

173
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,878
There's no need to worry.

174
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,681
The balance will be unstable until
the queen's inaugural ceremony is over.

175
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:56,884
If you create a new
disturbance on the Earth...

176
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:58,891
...the balance will be lost again.

177
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,926
I see...

178
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:03,759
Sis, don't do it! Misao's
finally just gotten happy again!

179
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,798
Shut up!!

180
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,362
So, what exactly do I have to do?

181
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,904
I've lost Misa, you know.

182
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:16,841
I know what I'm doing. I've already
chosen the third magical girl.

183
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:19,038
"The third magical girl"?

184
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:22,172
Yes. She'll attack
Umi no Hoshi Elementary School...

185
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,808
...and obliterate the school and Sammy!

186
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:27,478
No! If you do that, then
Misao will also be...!

187
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:28,952
Don't do it, Sis!

188
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,990
Freeze!

189
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:35,857
Just be quiet, would you?

190
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,897
So, tell me about the magical girl!

191
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:40,091
Right. This little girl...

192
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:45,801
What's wrong? Got a cold?

193
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:48,602
No, I don't think so.
That's weird.

194
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,736
It's against school rules
to pass around your cold!

195
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,745
That rule actually exists?!

196
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,577
Umi no Hoshi Elementary School

197
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:12,021
Hurry, Misao!

198
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,066
Wait up, Sasami!

199
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,778
This feels great!

200
00:11:28,214 --> 00:11:29,681
- Hey.
- Huh?

201
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:31,614
You're up here, too.

202
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:34,585
Hey, weren't you gonna
play soccer on the grounds?

203
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:37,384
The sixth graders took our space.

204
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,584
So we thought we might as
well play volleyball instead.

205
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:41,559
Oh, Hiroto!

206
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:44,096
Send me one of your Love Spikes!

207
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:48,328
Haida! I'm not sure why,
but that's against school rules!

208
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,037
Um, you two want to play with us?

209
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,037
Yeah!

210
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,903
Huh?

211
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,243
Get this!

212
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:59,238
Got it!

213
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,939
Yeah!

214
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:04,242
Got it!

215
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:09,485
Coming your way, Haida!

216
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:15,326
Oh, no! It went over.

217
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,920
- What a drag.
- Haida!

218
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,965
Wh-What's the big deal?!

219
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:23,261
I'll just have to go
get it, that's all.

220
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,967
Really?

221
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:31,537
Hey, Kenji?

222
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:32,509
Hm?

223
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,139
That Amano's changed lately, huh.

224
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:37,274
Yeah, she has.

225
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,014
She never used to play
sports or things like that.

226
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:43,783
She seems a lot happier.

227
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,688
You're not tired, Misao?

228
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:47,487
No, I feel just fine.

229
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:50,958
Boy, you really have
changed recently, huh.

230
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,497
Yeah.

231
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:56,433
I had no idea it was this much
fun playing with everyone!

232
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,896
We can play lots and lots
from now on!

233
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:00,830
Uh-huh!

234
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:04,307
Oh, boy. Where did
that ball get to?!

235
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,335
Gee!

236
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,711
At least Hiroto could've
helped me look for it!

237
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:12,144
Huh?

238
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:14,643
What?!

239
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,559
And then...

240
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:22,595
Ryo-Ohki!

241
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:24,129
S-Sasami!

242
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:27,564
I just got a special
message from Juraihelm!

243
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,966
Tsunami is... Tsunami is...!

244
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:33,270
What is it? Did something
happen to Tsunami?

245
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,466
She's been officially
named as the queen!

246
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,736
What?!

247
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,801
The queen's inauguration ceremony
will be held soon!

248
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,647
And it's thanks to you!!

249
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:45,283
Tsunami is going
to be the queen...?

250
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,315
Isn't that great, Sasami?!

251
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,619
Thanks so much, Sasami!!

252
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:54,626
Come on, you're embarrassing me!

253
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:58,955
I'd like to thank you, too.

254
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,897
Huh? What for?

255
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:04,228
If it weren't for you...
If it weren't for Sammy...

256
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,966
...I don't think
I ever would have changed.

257
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,872
The reason I'm having so much
fun now, is because of you!

258
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,809
Misao...

259
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:16,815
Let's keep on being good friends!

260
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:22,017
Of course! I'll be
your friend forever, Misao!

261
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:25,748
Thanks, Sammy.

262
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,590
She's sure relaxed and happy.

263
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,756
- Hiroto?
- Wh-What is it?

264
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:35,231
Haida still hasn't come back yet.

265
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,794
Yeah. She's taking a long time.

266
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,839
Lunch break is over! What does
she think she's doing?!

267
00:14:40,907 --> 00:14:44,673
And look! The clouds are
starting to look threatening.

268
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:48,309
Yeah, and it was so sunny
a while ago, too!

269
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,183
Let's hurry and get back to class.

270
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,718
But what about Haida?

271
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:55,754
She'll come back to class
when the bell rings.

272
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:57,722
- Guess you're right.
- Yeah.

273
00:14:57,924 --> 00:15:00,119
Kawai! Amano!
Let's get back to class!

274
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,285
Okay!

275
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,961
Oh, it's gonna start!

276
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:16,104
Then let's get started, too.

277
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:20,577
And now the final ceremony...

278
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:23,616
...for the 208th queen of Juraihelm.

279
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:25,082
Step forward, Tsunami.

280
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:26,948
Yes.

281
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,321
- What happened?
- The balance...!

282
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:36,327
Yes!!

283
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,321
Look at the screen!

284
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,059
What's going on...?!

285
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:43,002
Oh, my!

286
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:44,294
What?!

287
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,897
So, Haida hasn't come back yet?

288
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,972
Wonder if she can't find the ball?

289
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:50,702
Yeah...

290
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,540
Teacher!

291
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:55,809
As the class leader, I'll take
charge and go look for her.

292
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:58,783
Thanks a lot. That'd be great.

293
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,687
Wonder what happened?

294
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:06,748
- Sasami! Look!
- Huh?

295
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:10,927
Wow, unreal!

296
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,965
I'm getting scared...

297
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:17,326
What could Haida be doing?

298
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:19,894
- Worried about her?
- Listen, buddy...!

299
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,876
Uh, kids, please get
back to your seats...

300
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,284
- What is that thing?
- Huh?

301
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,325
That red light.

302
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:42,294
Wh-What?!

303
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,838
What?! What is it?!

304
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,063
Oh, my goodness!

305
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:57,302
A Love-love Monster...

306
00:16:57,377 --> 00:16:59,345
All right!

307
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,143
It's not a Love-love Monster.
No, sir-ee...

308
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,048
Something's descending.

309
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,252
Looks like people.

310
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:17,319
Oh, what's it gonna be THIS TIME?!

311
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:23,768
Girls...?

312
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,701
The usual Love-love Monsters,
aren't they?

313
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:28,240
They seem totally different, though.

314
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:30,969
Right Hair Attack!

315
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,389
Sasami!!

316
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,982
Ryo-Ohki!

317
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,391
Transform, Sasami!

318
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,091
Sasami...

319
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,567
Pretty Mutation...

320
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,698
...Magical Recall!

321
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,721
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

322
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:21,323
- Stop right there!
- Hm?

323
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:25,725
I don't know who you are, but I
won't let you get away with this!

324
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:29,662
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!
I'll protect everyone's school!

325
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,332
Don't make fun of me!
Take this!

326
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:38,306
Converge, magic powers of justice!

327
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:57,056
Pretty Coquettish Bomber!

328
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,801
You did it!

329
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,451
N-No way!!

330
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:24,212
The Pretty Coquettish Bomber
didn't work!

331
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,558
What's with them?!

332
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:30,996
We're not Love-love Monsters.
No, sir-ee!

333
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:33,062
Wh-Who are you?!

334
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,662
Nice to meet you, Pretty Sammy!

335
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:42,006
My name is Love Me Eimi!

336
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,610
I'm Love Me Eimi!

337
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:47,612
"Love Me Eimi"?!

338
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:50,377
"Love Me Eimi"?

339
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,187
"Love Me Eimi"...?

340
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:59,954
Hiroto! I finally got it!
It was caught in a tree...

341
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:01,994
Excuse me!

342
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:04,997
What's with her?!

343
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,565
Anyway, Hiroto... Huh?!

344
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,059
What's that? What's going on?!

345
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:13,562
Are you also a magical girl?!

346
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,971
That's right, Sammy!
From now on...

347
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:19,671
...you'll be fighting me
and my Lovely Monsters!

348
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:21,679
B-But why?!

349
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:25,444
Because someone can't have
you going around doing good!

350
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,177
That's so selfish!!

351
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:30,245
I don't need your lip!

352
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,587
Right! Left! Do your stuff!

353
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,192
It's against school rules
to stand on the hand railing!

354
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,230
Gee, what do you expect!

355
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,243
Sammy!

356
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:54,212
Sammy!

357
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,299
Imasara ieta girijanai keredo...

358
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:25,535
...watashi wa warukattawa.

359
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:33,716
