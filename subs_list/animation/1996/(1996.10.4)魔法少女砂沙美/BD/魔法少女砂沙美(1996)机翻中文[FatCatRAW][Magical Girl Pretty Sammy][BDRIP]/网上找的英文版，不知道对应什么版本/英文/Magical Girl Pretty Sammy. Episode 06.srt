1
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:03,856
My name's Rumiya.

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:06,800
I'm an average magical
boy in a magical world.

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,763
But my sister lost as a
candidate for the queen.

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,071
Darn it!

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,233
She was fuming!
So she said...

6
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:17,302
...we had to beat the hell
out of Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,680
She ordered Magical Girl Pixy Misa
to fight Pretty Sammy.

8
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,481
But for some reason, I'm the one
who has to take care of Misa.

9
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:28,682
Oh, I just want to live
an average, magical life.

10
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:31,318
Why do I have to have
a sister like her?!

11
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:33,795
Rumiya? Did you say something?

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,265
No, not a thing.

13
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:41,225
Dodge Ball Battle!!

14
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,739
All right, everyone.

15
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:55,784
Thank you for lunch.

16
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:13,035
Let's go, Kawai!
I'll really whip you this time!

17
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,604
Don't be so sure!

18
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:18,003
I've been working out with Dad!

19
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:20,165
That Division 3!

20
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:23,803
Well, wait till you check out
my new lethal magic ball!

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,745
It's unreal!

22
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:28,340
"Lethal"?! Sounds too deadly!

23
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:32,550
The old lethal magic ball. In this
day of science and technology...

24
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:34,350
...it's lethal AND magic.

25
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:38,519
Shut up! If magical girls exist,
then magic balls can, too!

26
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:39,856
Right, Kawai?

27
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,897
Yeah, I guess...

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,760
Grade 4, Division 3!
What time doyou think this is?!

29
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:54,072
I think it's lunch time.
Am I wrong, Kiyone?

30
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:56,111
Of course it is, but even
if it's break time...

31
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:59,079
...there's a limit to the noise level!
It's a nuisance to the other classes!

32
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:01,173
Yes, I suppose it is a nuisance.

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,911
It's YOUR class that's
making all the noise!

34
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:04,751
Oh, my.

35
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,380
Really? Are you sure?

36
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,814
You're making me mad!

37
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:13,419
Miss Kiyone is jealous
of Miss Mihoshi.

38
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:18,058
- They've had a bad relationship
since junior high school.
- Mihoshi, you have real problems...

39
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:21,035
...with your attitude toward education.
Students need leadership.

40
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:24,129
You can't let them run wild!
As a teacher, you should be a model.

41
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:27,403
You should lead these undeveloped
boys and girls with ethics.

42
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:29,467
You're one year my superior,
but this once...

43
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:31,513
...I'll give you
a piece of my mind!

44
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,741
Come on, Kiyone.

45
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:36,876
You're still upset because you
were unemployed for a year.

46
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:38,920
You're always upset.

47
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:41,846
- Time for lunch!
- That's not what I'm saying here!

48
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:46,191
- It's just about time.
- You don't know who you are,
as a teacher! No, you don't!

49
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:48,457
You're always late and doze off
at the morning meeting!

50
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:54,167
You're so lax, your students
lose sight of themselves as well!

51
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:56,067
Do you understand?!

52
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:58,106
So, keep it down!

53
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,509
No one is here.

54
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:05,303
What's going on here,
Miss Mihoshi?

55
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,350
They had to go get a court.

56
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,450
A court?!

57
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:13,821
Okay, let's split into groups.

58
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,255
Make the teams fairly
even in strength.

59
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:18,293
- Let's play, Kawai!
- Okay!

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,328
Hey, someone forgot this.

61
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,631
Huh? Where's Misao?

62
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:30,829
Who cares?
Leave her out of this.

63
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,237
Why should we, Konoha?

64
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:36,210
Amano's so lousy,
she'll go out right away.

65
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,073
She's no good at sports.

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,373
That's no way to talk!

67
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:44,545
Yeah. Can't say if she's good
or not until we see her play.

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,153
Come on, Hiroto.

69
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:50,420
I just wanted to have fun playing
dodge ball with everyone!

70
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,017
Would you let go of me?!

71
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,499
There you are, Misao!

72
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,326
Hurry, we're just about
to start dodge ball!

73
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:02,370
I have to get ready for classes.

74
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,372
You can do that later.

75
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,772
But I always go out right away.

76
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:10,744
Forget it. It's
nothing to worry about.

77
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:13,438
I'll just get in the way.

78
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,383
Do you hate dodge ball,
by any chance?

79
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:17,817
No!

80
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:20,014
Great. Then let's go!

81
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:23,651
Yay! Yay! Yay!

82
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:27,894
I can't decide which side
to cheer for!

83
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,597
Here goes!

84
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:30,825
Wait a minute!

85
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,527
Oh, my.

86
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,133
What do you guys want?!

87
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:43,104
This court belongs to us,
Division 2. Please get off.

88
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:47,476
Oh, that's a pity. This court
belongs to me and my darling.

89
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,849
I'm not her "darling,"
but we did get here first.

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,356
You just got here.
It's not nice to butt in.

91
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:56,323
We're not butting in.

92
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:59,293
We saved this court.

93
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:01,056
What, by spitting on it
or something?

94
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:05,365
No, not by spitting on it.
We put our ball here.

95
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:07,061
Huh?

96
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,530
I don't see any ball here.
Quit lying.

97
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,597
You shouldn't make things up!

98
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:16,569
I'm not making it up.
We did put our ball here.

99
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:18,773
Oh, that.

100
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:25,749
Oops, I goofed. It was in
the way, so I moved it.

101
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,254
My fault.

102
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,186
Kenji...

103
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,958
Now it's settled.

104
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,584
Just a second.

105
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:35,357
Leaving a ball doesn't mean
the court's yours.

106
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,296
There's nothing wrong with it.

107
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:39,334
When did that become the rule?

108
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:43,571
What year, month, day, hour,
minute, and second?!

109
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:51,337
Anyway, this is
Division 3's court!

110
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:53,973
I can't accept your claim
as legitimate.

111
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,418
What's that?!

112
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,521
Everybody!

113
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:05,018
It's no good to fight.
Let's try to get along.

114
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:08,727
Okay? I don't like fights.

115
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:11,655
- What should we do, Sasami?
- We have to stop this.

116
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:14,202
Getting along is
a beautiful thing.

117
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,332
This is Principal Miura.

118
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:18,999
Competition isn't about
winning or losing. Love wins.

119
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:22,942
Never think you'll win, or it'll
be the Nagano Winter Olympics.

120
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,378
The best competitions
are in sports.

121
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:27,415
Good idea!

122
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:32,151
One person for ten thousand,
ten thousand for one.

123
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,013
Did you hear, Miss Mihoshi?

124
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,548
I'll show you what a big
mistake you're making.

125
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:42,528
With the superiority of
my Grade 4, Division 2!

126
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,392
Whoah!

127
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:46,032
Oh, my.

128
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:49,002
- It's too late for regrets.
- What regrets?

129
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:51,406
You've always been apathetic!

130
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:55,341
You've been lucky and impudent,
and I always bear the brunt of it.

131
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:56,969
But you never notice.
You don't!

132
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,480
You just live so carefree!
Lucky you!

133
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:02,210
I feel so stupid
when I talk to you.

134
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:04,819
I really do.

135
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,641
But I still think life
should be fun...

136
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:34,573
Fight!

137
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,277
Here comes!

138
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,182
Nice shot, Hiroto!

139
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:46,651
Let's see about that.

140
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,458
What do you mean?

141
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,498
Triangle Formation!

142
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:56,100
This is where the opponent
has no chance to run.

143
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,139
They aim for anyone
that strays from the group.

144
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,306
Here goes!

145
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:10,518
They waste no shots...

146
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:13,282
...quickly putting the other
team out. A terrifying technique!

147
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:16,256
I read it in a book
published by Minmei!

148
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:22,519
Darn it! I'll have to use
the Magic Ball!

149
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,799
Big League Ball Number 3!

150
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,569
He throws a slow-ball, and
when the opponent moves...

151
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,540
...the air pressure prevents them
from grabbing the ball.

152
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:37,875
Another terrifying technique!
I read this in a Minmei book, too!

153
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:49,348
We just passed them
the ball, that's all.

154
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,320
Oops.

155
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:07,198
Sorry.

156
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,277
You mustn't run away.

157
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,853
You mustn't run away.

158
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:23,625
You mustn't run away, Sasami.

159
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:28,689
Hit back, Sasami!

160
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:36,302
How can you diet
so easily, Sasami?

161
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:40,207
Do you have any idea how
hard I have to work...

162
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,835
...to maintain my
beautiful proportions?!

163
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,614
Not that it matters,
in my opinion.

164
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,077
- Rumiya!
- Yes?

165
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,543
Rumiya, just hurry up and do it.
Hurry and get to it.

166
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:55,984
I pretty much figured out
what you're trying to say, Sis.

167
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,896
- Hiroto?
- What?

168
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,436
You're so warm.

169
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:10,531
Look out!

170
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,375
I can feel your love.

171
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:17,903
If we keep doing this, we're gonna lose
without getting the ball even once!

172
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,971
There's got to be some way...

173
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,209
I'm sorry, Sasami.

174
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:26,615
You're covering for me, so you
can't move where you want.

175
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:28,588
T-that's not true.

176
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:32,650
No, I've always watched you
play before, so I know.

177
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:33,660
That's, uh...

178
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:36,527
I'll get hit, so grab the ball.

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,227
Misao!

180
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,509
Ow!

181
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:50,970
Majima...

182
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:53,480
Kawai, use that ball well.

183
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,377
Sure!

184
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,214
He pushed me.
This proves that he likes me.

185
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:06,986
Don't be so arrogant.

186
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:08,693
But I'm not...

187
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:11,130
If Division 3 loses,
it'll be your fault...

188
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:14,168
...for getting Hiroto out, Amano.
I'll never forgive you!

189
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,513
Misao...?

190
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:34,278
See, Mihoshi? Here's the gap
between their educations.

191
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:36,483
The difference between us,
as educators!

192
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:39,425
Go, team, go!

193
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:42,352
I'm gonna use those things
that Dad taught me!

194
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:46,026
The Secret Nagoya Slam!!

195
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:53,875
The Revolving Magic Ball!!

196
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,441
The High Jump Throw!

197
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,015
The Overhead Serve!

198
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:10,985
Oops!

199
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:13,558
She blew it! I'll get it!

200
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:17,126
It's blinding me!

201
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:32,541
- What's happening?
- What is it?

202
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:36,749
And now, I'll introduce
a new player.

203
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:38,718
An addition to the 4-2 team.

204
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:41,950
Super-Relief, Pixy Misa!

205
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:44,058
Why?!

206
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,686
Magical Girl Pixy Misa!
To the rescue!

207
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:49,322
You students with no individuality!

208
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:53,630
We'll give the boys and girls
of Division 3 a hard time!

209
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:55,765
- Mihoshi?
- Yes?

210
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:57,361
What's with that girl?

211
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,101
Oh, she's an evil magical girl.

212
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:03,675
Magical girl? I must
be having a bad dream.

213
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:08,009
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

214
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:12,945
Calling Mystics!

215
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,950
Let's Fight! Line Girl, and...

216
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,521
...Ball Girl!

217
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:26,356
My, my, my, I'm so embarrassed
being called here suddenly.

218
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:30,804
Yeah, but aren't you glad,
with all these people here?!

219
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:33,898
No kidding.
My heart is gonna burst.

220
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:36,034
Sure it's not heartburn?

221
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,841
Leave me alone. I don't want
to hear that from you.

222
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:42,782
Yeah? Well, I'm thin as a line.
You're as round as they come.

223
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:45,984
You don't say?!
Then I'll get some exercise.

224
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,916
Here I come! Takoyaki Bomber!

225
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,522
Hey! You're not
supposed to move!

226
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:02,704
I'll make sure they
won't be able to move.

227
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,867
No way!

228
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:10,810
Osaka Pavilion Attack!

229
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,507
All right! All right!

230
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:15,874
W-what'll we do?!

231
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,585
Ryo-Ohki!

232
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:29,859
Oh, do I have to?

233
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:31,899
What do you think you're doing?!

234
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,034
Time out.

235
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:35,091
What for?

236
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,035
This cat's getting in the way.

237
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:39,198
What a nuisance.
You'd better hurry.

238
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,168
I hope this is okay...
I hope no one finds out...

239
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:45,240
Hurry and do it!

240
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:48,077
Is this a job for a
magical girl, too?

241
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,550
Of course it is! Here!

242
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:58,292
Pretty Mutation...

243
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:02,263
...Magical Recall!

244
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:18,510
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

245
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,979
What's happening?!

246
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:23,244
- Take that!
- And that!

247
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,711
This girl won't stay still!

248
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,647
- You're heavy!
- I've had enough of you!

249
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:32,955
Stop it!

250
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,121
Oh, my god. You made it.

251
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:40,062
Pretty Sammy is here!
I'll take over for everyone!

252
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:43,102
Count on Sammy when it
comes to dodging trouble!

253
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:47,074
Dodging trouble... dodge ball...

254
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:50,737
Not funny?

255
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:53,940
Spare me the sick
Ben Wada-type jokes.

256
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:56,210
Look at the real
stand-up comics!

257
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:58,343
Ball Girl! Line Girl!

258
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,084
Yeah!

259
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:02,145
I'll get her!

260
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:04,283
World EXPO Crash!

261
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,690
World EXPO... banzai.

262
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,502
What's with her?!

263
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,435
Here I come!

264
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:18,130
Oh!

265
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,080
Converge, magic powers of justice!

266
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:32,209
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

267
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:34,813
That's enough for you today!

268
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,722
Catch you later!

269
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:44,029
You did it, Sammy!

270
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,067
Count on me! Right?

271
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,796
Out!

272
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:53,400
Out...?

273
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:57,170
Oh, my...

274
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,179
Woohoo!

275
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,045
Mihoshi? I don't care if she
really was a magical girl.

276
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:05,109
You were wrong to think such
a childish trick would work.

277
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:08,678
People aren't fooled
so easily, you know.

278
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,075
We turned it around!

279
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:29,770
You did it, Amano!

280
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:32,745
It goes to show
Division 3's strength!

281
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,843
Way to go, Amano!

282
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,019
Good job!

283
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:40,782
It's wonderful!
I'm so impressed!

284
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:45,519
Impossible...

285
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:51,431
Principal! Isn't that against
the rules?! It's not fair!

286
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,358
It is fair.

287
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:54,902
Why is that?

288
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,096
It's my downfall.

289
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,105
I can't take it anymore!

290
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,742
Way to go, Misao!

291
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:13,778
Guess what, Ramia! Sasami restored
the balance a little more!

292
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:15,823
Yeah, so I take it.

293
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:18,082
Oh, Ramia?

294
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,421
What?

295
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:21,462
You've put on some weight,
haven't you?

296
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,597
Have I?

297
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,429
Eat this!!

298
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:38,279
Let's go, Kawai.

299
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:40,576
I'll show you the new lethal
technique I came up with.

300
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,576
Can't beat me!

301
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,277
Right?

302
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:49,623
Hurry up and come...

303
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,952
...boys and girls of Division 3!

304
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,819
Show your stuff!

305
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:58,422
Oh, what's going on here?

306
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:01,258
Look! It's Tokyo Tower, destroyed!

307
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:04,338
Yeah, well, check out my frog!

308
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:10,035
Tokyo Tower, revamped!

309
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:12,509
No more dodge ball?

310
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,482
That's a game of the past.
Cat's cradle is all the rage, now.

311
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,049
Oh, I see.

312
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:22,916
We'll show you today,
boys and girls of Division 3.

313
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,827
Huh? They're not coming...
