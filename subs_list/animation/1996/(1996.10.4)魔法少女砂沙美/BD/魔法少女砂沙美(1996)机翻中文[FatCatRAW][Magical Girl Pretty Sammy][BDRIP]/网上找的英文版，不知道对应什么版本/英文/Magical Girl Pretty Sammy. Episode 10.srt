1
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,632
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:18,567
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,962
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,997
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,277
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,619
...my incantation is "Pipopa "...

7
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:41,090
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,924
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,966
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,593
...I flop out.

11
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:55,739
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,502
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,346
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:05,916
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,680
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:12,510
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,857
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,653
Hey!

19
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:49,023
Hey!

20
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:55,728
Sorry! No room!

21
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:09,646
The motorbike's nice,
but horses are nice, too.

22
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,704
Let's ride all the way home!

23
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,579
What a great plan.

24
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,048
Stop!

25
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:20,649
What is it?

26
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:22,751
Huh?

27
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,886
"Western Village up ahead"...

28
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,893
Change of route!

29
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,763
Roger!

30
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:41,743
- Someone's hanging up there!
- What?!

31
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:49,080
Hey! Are you okay?

32
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,819
You, over there.
Would you please help me?

33
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:55,651
Sure thing!

34
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,124
I'll get you right down.

35
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,135
Are you okay, lady?

36
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,431
Yeah, I think so.

37
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,773
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

38
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:16,112
Thanks for saving me.

39
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,977
I'm Shinobi; granddaughter
of the village mayor.

40
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,573
Shinobi?

41
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,278
Yes.

42
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:28,683
It feels just like a western movie.

43
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:33,992
But you're not dressed in
a western style, Shinobi.

44
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,790
These are ninja clothes.

45
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,295
What's a ninja doing
in a western village?

46
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,732
It's a long story.

47
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,207
Oh. Well, what were you
doing tied up back there?

48
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,003
It was their doing.

49
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,480
"Their"?

50
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:55,411
Yes. They're trying to
take over this village.

51
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,346
Oni Jigoku's Gang.

52
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,389
Oni Jigoku's Gang?

53
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,589
That's my house.

54
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,628
That house is the only one
done in an old Japanese style.

55
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,622
I'm home!

56
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,258
Grandpa!

57
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,962
Grandpa!

58
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,466
Oops!

59
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,803
Nice catch.

60
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,270
Who are you?

61
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,644
My name is Genjuro Hagakure.

62
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,476
Village mayor. And you are...?

63
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:30,549
Sasami's dad. Ginji.

64
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,588
I'm Sasami!

65
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,521
And this is Ryo-Ohki.

66
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:38,220
These people saved me, when
I was tied up to the front gate.

67
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:41,230
What?! You were captured
by Oni Jigoku again?!

68
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,697
I'm sorry!

69
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,597
You tarnished our name once again!

70
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,136
Seems like there's more to this.

71
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,434
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to hear.

72
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,242
Please, come in.

73
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,214
This was once just a common,
small village.

74
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:04,379
But people gradually moved away,
and to stop the drift...

75
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:08,686
...we tried to revive the village by
starting a ninja village for the tourists.

76
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,727
A ninja village?

77
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,058
Everyone was dressed in
inconspicuous ninja attire.

78
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,100
Jumping from rooftop to rooftop.

79
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,260
Throwing stars instead of
greeting each other.

80
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,868
It was a wonderful village.

81
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:26,735
Is that "wonderful," Dad?

82
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,040
Yes, I get the feeling it was.

83
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,213
Because of the terrible
transportation network...

84
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,250
...the tourists didn't show up at all.

85
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:39,812
That's when my lifelong rival, Oni Jigoku,
tried to take over the village.

86
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,158
I see. That's the man you mentioned.

87
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,625
Yes. The man who tied me up.

88
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:48,726
Oni Jigoku and his subordinates
tricked the villagers,...

89
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:52,064
...destroyed the ninja village,
and built a western village.

90
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,700
That fool, with western mania!

91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,205
Are you okay?

92
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,243
Stop worrying about me!

93
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,970
If you have time to worry,
get doing your ninja training!

94
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,382
But I don't have the talent
of my big brother!

95
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,577
Don't talk about Binpachi!

96
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:13,247
He said ninjas weren't good
enough for him, and left home!

97
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,689
We've walked into a real mess.

98
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,158
Yeah.

99
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,730
Where are you, my brother?

100
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,731
Why should I care?

101
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,323
I'm right here!

102
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,631
- Brother!
- Binpachi...!

103
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,330
Amigo!

104
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,639
That's dangerous, Brother!

105
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,504
Stop that, fool!

106
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,576
Long time, Shinobi. Grandpa.

107
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,774
Binpachi! That outfit...!

108
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,819
You sold your soul
to the westerners!

109
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,548
And you're the grandson of
the ninja village mayor!

110
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:49,555
Gramps, ninjas are out of date.

111
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:53,226
These days you've got to sell
American culture to young men.

112
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:54,923
Precisely!

113
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,866
Oni Jigoku!

114
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,561
Came to pay a visit, Genjuro.

115
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,670
Keep your filthy boots out of here!

116
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,709
My apologies. I always do things
the American way.

117
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,278
Make yourself at home, boss.

118
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,440
It's a sty, though.

119
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,212
Binpachi! You've joined up
with this villain?

120
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,583
Yeah, well. Guns are
so cool, you know.

121
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,017
Today I'll hear the answer
I'm looking for.

122
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,815
Let us tear down this house.

123
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:27,227
I won't! This ninja residence
is my very life!

124
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:32,393
Listen, Genjuro. We're trying to build
a nice, chic western village.

125
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:35,202
Yours is the only house
still standing.

126
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,235
You forced the others into
building the western village!

127
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:42,300
It looks strange, having a ninja
house in a western village.

128
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,903
That's none of MY business!

129
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:46,707
Ninjas are a thing of the past.

130
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:51,243
To attract young people, you
need a trendy American feel.

131
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:54,749
Viva America!
Western is the best!

132
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:58,225
Even your charming grandson says so.

133
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:00,388
Now hand over this property, already.

134
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:04,326
I refuse to! I'll never move,
as long as I live!

135
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:08,836
Genjuro, if you're going
to be stubborn about this...

136
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,567
...then I'll be forced
to make a tragic choice.

137
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,905
W-What's that?

138
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,275
Dead men tell no tales...

139
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,316
B-Boss, you don't have to go that far!

140
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,950
Back off! Well, Genjuro?

141
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,651
Ninjas don't yield to threats.

142
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,323
I see. You're still acting
like the big man.

143
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,486
We'll carve " Here lies a man...

144
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:35,190
...who retained the ninja spirit
till the end" on your grave.

145
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,128
- Now.
- Yes.

146
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:49,375
Stop right there!

147
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,414
Who's that?!

148
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,907
Who are you?

149
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,716
I'm Sasami's dad.
The name's Ginji Kawai.

150
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:01,457
I'm his daughter, Sasami!

151
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,684
And this is our pet, Ryo-Ohki.

152
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,428
What does this warm family
want here?

153
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:11,162
Mr. Oni Jigoku.
You're a coward.

154
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,595
What?!

155
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:15,331
Assassinating an old invalid,
who's outnumbered.

156
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:17,396
Stealing his land, to boot.

157
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,102
If that's not cowardly,
then what is?

158
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:22,235
Are you criticizing my methods?

159
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,980
If you're really a western outlaw...

160
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,643
...then a western duel should
determine the outcome.

161
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:31,650
3 people will represent the ninja team,
and 3, the gunman team.

162
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,655
They'll fight it out.

163
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:36,317
The losers will abide by
the winners' decision.

164
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:38,156
What do you think?

165
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:40,162
Sounds interesting. We're in.

166
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,965
So? Who's on your team?

167
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,660
Me and...

168
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,629
But, Grandpa, you can't move.

169
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,995
I'm in!

170
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:52,473
- Sorry, Shinobi.
- Who are the other two?

171
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,238
Sasami and I will participate.

172
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,979
Who, me?!

173
00:09:57,047 --> 00:10:01,882
All right, it's settled then.
Me and Binpachi will fight you.

174
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,146
What? I'm in?

175
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:09,586
Yes. You'll prove if you've truly
sold your soul to the western side.

176
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,523
O-Okay. No problem.

177
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,898
You dimwit!

178
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:17,727
Brother...

179
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,598
Who's the third person?

180
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:24,496
I figured this would happen,
so I've hired a gunman.

181
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:26,064
Come out, Mistress!

182
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,404
Hi!

183
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:29,104
Misa! What are you doing here?!

184
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,681
Why are you surprised?

185
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:35,584
Wherever Sasami goes,
I soon show up.

186
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:37,813
It's universal common sense.

187
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,583
Wait, Misa! You're
an ally of Oni Jigoku?!

188
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:46,789
Well, after all, this American western
thing fits my personality to a tee.

189
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,224
Mistress Misa is a distinguished
magical girl in Japan.

190
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,258
What a score she is.

191
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,969
- Sasami...!
- What'll we do?

192
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:09,674
We'll have matches to decide whether
to tear down the ninja residence.

193
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,586
The first match is
Sasami Kawai versus Pixy Misa.

194
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,747
I'm scared!

195
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:16,018
The bullets are paint balls.

196
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,028
And these throwing stars are toys,
made of hard rubber. Don't worry.

197
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,167
When I say so,
you'll each take 3 paces.

198
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:28,671
Misa will use the gun, and
Sasami will use the throwing stars.

199
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,640
Of course, the one who is
hit will lose. Understand?

200
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,539
- All right.
- Y-Yes.

201
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,475
Then let's begin.

202
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,376
On your marks!

203
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:39,276
One!

204
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,782
Two!

205
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,317
Three!

206
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,521
Adios, amigo!

207
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:47,983
And the match goes to Misa!

208
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,719
Oh, I'm so happy!

209
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,058
What?! That's against the rules!

210
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,065
Was it? I took my 3 paces
before I shot, didn't I?

211
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,261
Sasami was stupid to turn
her back on the enemy.

212
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:04,268
Y-You're so unfair!!

213
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:13,514
Match number two. Ginji Sasami
versus Oni Jigoku, the gang leader!

214
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,346
The fastest shooter
will win this match.

215
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:18,945
I'll show you what a crime
it was to call me a coward!

216
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,348
Ready? Go!

217
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,556
What? What just happened?

218
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:28,119
That man did it!

219
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:30,063
What do you mean?

220
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:30,929
Huh?!

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,662
He shot down the paint ball
with the throwing star.

222
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,363
Darn you! Take this!

223
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,972
Blast!

224
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:45,739
The end.

225
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,283
Match over! Ginji Kawai wins!

226
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,841
You did it, Dad!

227
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,682
We're tied, one each.

228
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:55,554
Shinobi, the Hagakure clan's
fate is resting with you.

229
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,559
Yes.

230
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,522
Brother...

231
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,632
Shinobi...

232
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:10,332
Match three. Binpachi Hagakure
versus Shinobi Hagakure.

233
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,537
Again, the fastest
shooter wins. Begin!

234
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,540
Binpachi! Why did you
start hating ninjas?

235
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,150
Because. Ninjas are so dark,
and they're not cool.

236
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,619
It's true they're clad
in black all year round.

237
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,552
Always on the roof,
or under the floor...

238
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:30,252
They have the image of being
in damp, dark places.

239
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:34,493
But look at the western style!
It's as out-of-date as ninjas!

240
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,428
What? Is that right?

241
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,223
Of course it is!

242
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:42,067
You were always training with
Grandpa, so you might not know...

243
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:45,699
...but wearing those fluttery clothes
in this day and age is STUPID!

244
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:47,632
I didn't know that.

245
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,178
I thought I was on the
leading edge of fashion.

246
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,381
What are you saying, Missy?!

247
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,118
Brother! Being a ninja is
much better than being a gunman.

248
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,916
I think.
So please! Come home!

249
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,322
Shinobi.

250
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:07,090
What are you doing, Binpachi?!
Hurry and shoot her down!

251
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:09,358
But, boss...!

252
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,900
- How irritating! Oh, Mistress!
- Yeah, yeah.

253
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:15,734
We'll have to round up
the lot. Get them all!

254
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,306
Okay.

255
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,609
Calling Mystics!

256
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,331
A Love-love Monster?!

257
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,266
Welcome to the town from hell!

258
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,667
Gunman Girl!

259
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:51,400
Throw these people into
the crucible of fear, please!

260
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,812
Dad! Do something!

261
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,850
Sorry. Out of throwing stars.

262
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:21,495
Stop this! Who said to
destroy the buildings?!

263
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,738
It's merely incidental.

264
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:26,400
I can't afford you to incidentally
destroy the buildings!

265
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:39,455
She's sure got out an antique...

266
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,987
- Binpachi!
- Huh?

267
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:53,428
Grandpa!

268
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:56,828
Grandpa!

269
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,771
Binpachi, are you okay?

270
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,331
You covered for me!

271
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,811
Binpachi... ninjas are cool.

272
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,416
- Grandpa!
- Grandfather!

273
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,913
What's this serious
development about?!

274
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:14,251
Gunman Girl! Stop!

275
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,660
She's out of control!!!

276
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,591
- Transform, Sasami!
- Yeah!

277
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,566
Pretty Mutation...

278
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,837
...Magical Recall!

279
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,487
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

280
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,463
See you in hell, baby.

281
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,558
Stop right there!

282
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,562
Summer vacation has
the smell of gunpowder.

283
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,368
Ever popular, Pretty Sammy!

284
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,805
I love high places!

285
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:09,204
Whoah!

286
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,842
Careful, Sammy.
She doesn't get jokes.

287
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,682
Misa! You should be more responsible
for the things you create!

288
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,614
Oh, no!

289
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,652
She's gonna get us!

290
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:24,051
Find a crack in her armor, Sammy!

291
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,958
I don't have that kind of time!

292
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,733
Bye-bye.

293
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:39,165
What?

294
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:44,208
Was that the dummy trick?

295
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,305
- Do it now, Sammy!
- Yeah!

296
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:54,748
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

297
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,525
No!

298
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,371
Grandpa...!

299
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,909
Binpachi.

300
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,706
Grandpa! You're alive!

301
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,440
But how...

302
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,945
Oh!

303
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,712
What's so funny?

304
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,553
Grandpa! Ninjas sure are cool!

305
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:33,094
Huh?

306
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:41,433
- This turned out great!
- Yeah.

307
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:43,233
- Hey, Sammy!
- Huh?

308
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,905
Oh, Dad... uh, Mr. Kawai.

309
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:49,308
The evil magical girl
wanted me to give you this.

310
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:50,739
Oh?

311
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,447
"Hi, Sammy!..."

312
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:55,712
"It's getting late,
so I'll be on my way."

313
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,845
"Oh. And thanks,
just a little, for today."

314
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,219
" Ha, ha, ha. Misa."

315
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,425
That Misa...!

316
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:06,723
By the way, Sammy,
I haven't seen Sasami around.

317
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:11,523
Oh, don't worry. I saved Sasami.

318
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,569
I see. Thank you.

319
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:16,662
Well, bye.

320
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,641
See you next week!

321
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,644
She's always so delightful!

322
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,777
My western village...!

323
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:30,249
Oni Jigoku.

324
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:31,747
Genjuro.

325
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,545
Go ahead and laugh.

326
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:36,148
I don't have the energy to
revive the village anymore.

327
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:38,989
Make a ninja village, or anything
else; whatever you want.

328
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:40,688
You fool!

329
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:45,934
Being crushed after one failure.
Is this western thing only a facade?

330
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,197
Don't you have the western
spirit of a settler?

331
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:50,801
Genjuro...

332
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:55,003
Well, I was mistaken, too.
Only destruction is born of disputes.

333
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,739
Let's work together and
rebuild our village.

334
00:19:58,381 --> 00:19:59,712
What do you mean?

335
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,250
I mean we'll build a new
ninja-western village.

336
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:05,617
With made-up history
and lots of action.

337
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:09,958
Ninjas and gunmen develop
a huge entertainment land!

338
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:11,823
It'll be a big hit!

339
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:14,992
Genjuro...! You're not discouraged,
despite everything.

340
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:17,589
You're a real man.
A man among men.

341
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:20,827
Oni Jigoku.

342
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,598
Genjuro, I'm with you.

343
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:25,140
Well, that's one matter.

344
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,573
But you will pay for
your ill will.

345
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,167
Huh?

346
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:33,079
Boss, the sun is coming up.

347
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,707
It's going down, fool.

348
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,615
Announcement: This man once tried
to take over the Ninja Village.
Ah, that feels better!

349
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:42,016
Take care, everyone!

350
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:44,719
You too, Sasami! Thank you!

351
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,530
I'm... I'm going to become
a great ninja!

352
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,228
Then I'll make this place world-famous!

353
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:08,874
Once again, the girl you're watching...

354
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:14,211
...isn't the real me.

355
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:20,093
It's a girl...

356
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:23,620
...that was made up...

357
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:30,127
...for you and for our love.

358
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,171
You like my honesty.

359
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,814
That's what you say...

360
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,116
...but it's an illusion.

361
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:51,054
Deceiving others is a way of life.

362
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:54,123
It's a woman's romance.

363
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:58,622
I love you more than anyone.

364
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,569
I want to show you
a wonderful dream.

365
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,801
I love you so much.

366
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:08,769
I'm going to keep deceiving you.

367
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:13,578
I'll make you happier...

368
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:20,411
...than any other guy in the world.

369
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,596
Oh, no! I've lost my
magical baton!

370
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:34,033
If I can't transform into a magical girl,
I'm just a regular girl!

371
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,128
No, I've got to find it!

372
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,196
Coming next: Lost Baton.

373
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,971
If you find a lost article, take
it to a police station, okay?
