1
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:14,228
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,095
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:20,662
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,603
...tsukai you!

5
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:32,873
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:35,215
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,686
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

8
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:43,520
...demae ni yatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,562
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:50,190
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:54,335
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:56,098
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,538 --> 00:01:00,942
...genki ni nareruwa.

14
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:04,512
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

15
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,276
Fushigi na chikara ga.

16
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:11,015
Yume mireba yume mo...

17
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:14,445
...yume janai.

18
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:37,105
I learned something very
valuable in my childhood.

19
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:39,146
"Put something away
for a rainy day."

20
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:41,715
Because I put this into practice...

21
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:46,046
...even though I made many mistakes,
I was always able to cope with them.

22
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:50,179
That's the kind of person I am. So
even though Love Me Eimi was defeated...

23
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:52,852
...of course I had another plan
ready to follow through with.

24
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:57,254
"The NT System."
A device to capture magical power.

25
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,789
The people of Juraihelm are
powerless without magic.

26
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:05,328
Tsunami and Ramia are nothing
more than weird young ladies.

27
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,868
So, the next plan is
to destroy the Earth.

28
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:11,912
I'm sure there will be many
obstacles along the way.

29
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:16,416
Therefore I'm going to
renew my determination!

30
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,513
"Put something away
for a rainy day!"

31
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:23,523
The Moon Must Be Hell!

32
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,958
The color of Juraihelm
is changing!

33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,230
Oryo! What's happening?

34
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,199
What is that Romio person
planning on doing?!

35
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,292
What did she mean,
"destroy the Earth"?!

36
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,905
I don't know.

37
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:39,898
Mistress Tsunami...

38
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:41,571
Disgusting.

39
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:44,907
I can't even consider
being next to that planet.

40
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,947
Let's get it to move.

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,094
The magical cannons I made myself.

42
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,961
They're pumped with energy,
too, thanks to everyone.

43
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,964
Well, let's try firing them off.

44
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,539
Fire!

45
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,108
Is everyone all right?

46
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:51,508
Gee, that's against school rules!

47
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:54,579
Wow, what a spectacle!

48
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,344
What the heck happened?!

49
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,408
Oh, Hiroto!
I was scared!

50
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,545
Get off of me!
You're the scary one!

51
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:03,920
Are you all right, Misao?

52
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,084
Oh, my! The moon...!

53
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:09,226
The moon...

54
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:11,124
...it's getting further away!

55
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:13,325
Wonder if it's flying away?

56
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:16,495
No! The Earth is flying away!

57
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,003
What?!

58
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:22,942
Good-bye, everyone!

59
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:25,508
Enjoy your short trip!

60
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:38,189
There's no doubt! The Earth
is shifting toward the sun!

61
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:39,424
Which means...

62
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,893
Wow! We'll have another summer!

63
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:43,954
No! We'll be swallowed
up by the sun!

64
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,692
WE'RE GONNA DIE!!

65
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:49,998
No way! I'd rather die
than die in this outfit!

66
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:53,405
Miss Date, your Japanese
is terrible!

67
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,442
You'd better start reading
some books!

68
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:58,577
Teacher, I don't really think
that's the issue here...

69
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,944
Yeah! The issue is that costume!

70
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:02,607
Another strike-out.

71
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:07,143
The problem here is that the Earth
is heading for the sun!!!

72
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:11,118
Oh, yeah! That's it!

73
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,460
THE CAT TALKED!!

74
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:16,553
What'll we do, Oryo?

75
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,565
At this rate, everyone's
gonna be done in!

76
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,191
First of all, I'll...

77
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:23,133
Shut up, Teacher!

78
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:26,234
B-B-But the cat was talking!

79
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:28,241
That's not what's important here!

80
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:31,073
That's right!
Who cares about a talking cat...

81
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,080
...when the Earth is
headed for the sun?!

82
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:36,607
Okay.

83
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:39,414
Anyway, I'll head back
to Juraihelm...

84
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,887
...and search for a way
to save the Earth.

85
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,251
I'll go, too!
Take me with you!

86
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,623
Hold on, this is a job
for a guard.

87
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,390
You stay here, just
in case Romio attacks.

88
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:51,362
Mm-hm...

89
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,328
I'm counting on you, Pretty Sammy!

90
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:58,531
Be careful, Overly-Splendid Oryo!

91
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:06,179
You're...!!

92
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:09,409
Sammy! You've gotta
help me! Please!

93
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:21,161
Mistress Tsunami!

94
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,623
Hang in there, Mistress Tsunami!

95
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,802
Darn! Romio did this to you!

96
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,134
Yup, you got it!

97
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:39,237
Romio! What've you done
to Tsunami and the others?!

98
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:43,572
Well, I captured their
magical powers.

99
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:45,516
Captured?!

100
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:51,185
Yes, thanks to everyone,
I fired the magical cannons.

101
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:55,425
Why, you...! Return the Earth and
everyone here back to normal, now!

102
00:06:58,132 --> 00:06:59,565
No way.

103
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,601
I'll teach you!

104
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:06,833
Wh-What...? M-My powers...

105
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,701
You weak, delicate, weird maiden.

106
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:12,803
You have no magic.
You're a short-necked giraffe.

107
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,643
What's that supposed to mean?

108
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:16,879
Not a thing.

109
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,976
Wh-What the heck...?

110
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:31,528
What? So you mean,
even though Oryo went...

111
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:37,364
Yeah. As long as that thing's around,
people in Juraihelm are helpless.

112
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:40,363
Romio has conquered Juraihelm.

113
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:43,175
Sammy, you're the only one
who can confront Romio!

114
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,644
The cat...! And the bird...!

115
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,578
Shut up, Teacher!

116
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:48,842
Okay.

117
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,044
Please, Sammy! Go to Juraihelm!

118
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,643
Hey, bird, you can't...!

119
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,518
Gotcha! I'll go!

120
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:56,647
Sammy!

121
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:59,386
I can't just leave Tsunami
like that! And besides...

122
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,487
...at this rate, the Earth
will be swallowed up by the sun!

123
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,555
I've gotta do something
to try to stop it!

124
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:09,198
But how are you gonna
get to Juraihelm?

125
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:14,341
Bet you hadn't thought about THAT!

126
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,399
Well, I came here so suddenly, I...

127
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:20,237
Can't she pass through the
same portal you came by?

128
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:23,545
Only my sister can open
the magic portal!

129
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,081
Oh, no! I haven't even left yet,
and I already have problems!

130
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,758
That's...

131
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,763
You want to go into
outer space, but can't.

132
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,299
Listen, you with that problem.

133
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:49,609
So I wonder if that's HER...

134
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,743
This development isn't disappointing.

135
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,681
That's right! I am a singing,
dancing, songwriting inventor.

136
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:02,188
Leave it to me, Washu
Fitzgerald Kobayashi!

137
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,626
Huddle!

138
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:07,388
What'll we do?

139
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:10,225
First of all, guitars on school
grounds are against the rules!

140
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,197
But maybe she can help us!

141
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:12,866
What'll we do?

142
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:14,368
Excuse me...?

143
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:15,562
Think she can really help?

144
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:16,337
Hello?

145
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:19,067
But we don't have any other plans.

146
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,641
Hey, you guys!

147
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,266
It wouldn't hurt to try.

148
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:24,641
Yeah, I guess. And we
are running out of time.

149
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:27,112
Professor! Please help us out!

150
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:29,782
Sure, okay!

151
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,564
When did she make that thing?!

152
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,937
Hey, Miss Kobayashi! You can't
just go around making rockets!

153
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:54,774
To make matters worse,
we're in a real jam here!

154
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:58,743
Calm down, Shopping District Manager.
There's nothing wrong with it.

155
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,780
It's for world peace, after all.

156
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:05,407
Professor Washu! Can you
operate a thing like that?!

157
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:10,449
Well, actually, I've never really
been into outer space before.

158
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:12,492
Let me handle this!

159
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:18,195
Can you operate a rocket, Johnny?!

160
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:20,233
It's Ginji.

161
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:24,832
What's this? "International
Driver's License, Class A."

162
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,702
"Unlimited operation of
two-wheeled vehicles."

163
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:29,299
"Meets class two plane
operation requirements."

164
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:32,243
"Accepted into rank three, by
the Japanese Abacus Federation."

165
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,007
"NASA astronaut license."

166
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:37,050
What?!

167
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,714
Ting-a-lingle-ling!

168
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:40,913
How noble, Ginji!

169
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,286
Wow! Cool!

170
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:45,518
Who the heck is Kawai's dad?!

171
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,794
All right!
To the sea of stars!

172
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:51,854
Let's go, Sammy!

173
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,630
Is this gonna work...?

174
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,246
Ooh, that tastes good.

175
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:12,308
And to be able to watch the
Earth disappear, at the same time!

176
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:14,354
Another fine taste!

177
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,382
But...

178
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,825
Then I may not need those
cannons anymore...

179
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:23,055
What a shame.

180
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:26,889
- Here you are, Ginji.
- Thank you.

181
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:30,232
Honoka, I'll be back by dinner.

182
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:33,637
Sure. I'll make one of your
favorites and wait for you!

183
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:36,903
Here, Sammy!

184
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:41,539
I always make one for Sasami's
field trips. Go ahead!

185
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,842
Thank you!

186
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,351
I love your lunch boxes!!

187
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,386
Aren't you going, Rumiya?

188
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:59,064
No, I wouldn't want to
exceed the weight limits.

189
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:02,900
Oh! I see!

190
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,232
I get it!

191
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:05,965
Of course! I gotcha!

192
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,939
Oh, yeah? Well, anyway...

193
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,776
...what could be loaded
in such a huge rocket?

194
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:12,072
Dunno.

195
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,539
Be careful, Sammy.

196
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:16,947
No problem!
I'll whiz there!

197
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:20,009
Boom! Fix the problem!
And zoom! Whiz home!

198
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:22,581
Okay?

199
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,359
See ya!

200
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:29,487
Bon voyage!

201
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,056
Yes! Take off!

202
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,624
Come off it, this isn't
a field trip.

203
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,668
Okay, Johnny.
Get us to the moon.

204
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:41,341
What's happening?!

205
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:45,975
He's gone wild!

206
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:47,741
- No, he's excited!
- What?!

207
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:51,473
The rush of going into outer
space has awakened his instincts!

208
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,816
I dunno if this is
promising or worrying!

209
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,524
Let's go for it!!

210
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:58,252
Yeah!

211
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,027
Let's go for it!!

212
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,063
Good-bye!

213
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:06,228
It's shaking!

214
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,663
It's handmade, you know.

215
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:15,565
Listen, Birdie.

216
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:17,109
I have a favor to ask.

217
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:20,146
You changed me into
Pixy Misa, right?

218
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,105
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:23,945
But I won't do it again!

220
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:25,814
No! Please...

221
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:28,753
...you've gotta lend me
the magical cane once more!

222
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:36,925
Up until now, Sasami has
always rescued me. So...

223
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:40,361
This time I want to rescue Sasami.

224
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:45,598
But you might turn into Misa
who doesn't embrace your feelings.

225
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,273
I'll be fine. I won't try to hide
my weakness or jealousy anymore.

226
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,116
I know I'm full of contradictions.
But all things considered...

227
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:59,809
...I love myself and Misa.

228
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,445
So I think I'll be fine.

229
00:14:04,224 --> 00:14:06,624
Please, Rumiya.

230
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:19,566
Ready, Misao? The
transformation incantation is...

231
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,370
I know. Because I am Misa.

232
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:23,974
Okay.

233
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:27,137
Pixy Mutation...

234
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,842
...Magical Recall!

235
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:34,110
Hello, everybody!

236
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:38,248
My 1.1 trillion, 1 million, 101
fans from across the country!

237
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,162
Long time no see!!
I'm Magical Girl Pixy Misa!

238
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,200
It's a little embarrassing,
but I've made my comeback!

239
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:55,001
What's with that dejected
expression, Rumiya?

240
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:58,943
Just wondering whether it was
a good idea for you to transform!

241
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:02,038
Oh, there's positively
nothing to worry about!

242
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:04,413
Leave absolutely
everything up to me!

243
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:07,179
Yeah, sure. But how are
you gonna get there?

244
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,518
Even YOU can't make it
into outer space!

245
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,153
Nothing to fret about!

246
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,352
It's show time!!

247
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:17,926
In an effort to negotiate with
the woman known as Romio...

248
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:19,966
...the US will be launching
the Endeavor.

249
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:23,168
You're not...!

250
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:26,000
Go to America!

251
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:29,434
A-Amano is...!

252
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,904
...Pixy Misa!!

253
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,709
Boy, what a shocker that is!

254
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:36,777
What on earth is with that girl?!

255
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,047
Running wild in that outfit and
normally acting as a shy bimbo!

256
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,611
She might have been
forced to by someone.

257
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:43,656
Just like Eimi.

258
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,693
No! Don't call me that! Please!

259
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,396
We bring you this update.

260
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,463
A shift of the Earth's position has
started southern ice caps melting.

261
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,566
This has increased sea levels,
and many areas around the world...

262
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,612
...are being submerged under water.

263
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,109
According to the International
Association of Scientists...

264
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:11,582
...globally, coastal cities
including Tokyo will be submerged...

265
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:12,185
...and will be swallowed up by the sun.

266
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:13,812
Hiroto?

267
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:19,951
What are you gonna do
with that piggy bank?

268
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:26,155
I thought that money was so you
could buy a new soccer ball?

269
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,327
It's none of your business what
I use it for! Leave me alone!

270
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:32,372
Stupid.

271
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:43,373
You can't possibly get to space
with that tiny amount of money!

272
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,743
You give "pathetic" a bad name!
Chasing after a girl...

273
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:51,086
...who may not even like you.
Getting totally wrapped up in yourself.

274
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:54,889
Do you really think if you do that,
she'll consider being with you?!

275
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,435
Here's your tea.

276
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:05,896
Go to the moon then,
and get dumped!

277
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,838
Shut up! You couldn't
possibly know!

278
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:10,877
I DO know!!

279
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,020
Because you're doing
just what I am.

280
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:30,594
Can't compete with someone
like a magical girl.

281
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:39,863
How sad.

282
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:58,982
This is Houston.
This is Houston.

283
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:00,686
Report your status, Endeavor. Over.

284
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,153
All systems A-Okay!

285
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,189
Green lights all the way!
Things are super-duper!

286
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,292
- Over!
- Who is this?!!

287
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,234
- We're in trouble!
- What's wrong?!

288
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:15,206
The Endeavor staff were
locked into a warehouse!

289
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:17,766
What?!
Endeavor! Endeavor!

290
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,874
Who's up there, Endeavor?!

291
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:24,144
Why of course, the fighter
for justice, Magical Pixy Mi...

292
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:25,184
...OW!

293
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:28,085
Pixy Meow?! What's that?!
Pixy Meow?!

294
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:31,117
I'm coming to help you!

295
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:33,352
Just hang on and wait for me!

296
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:36,918
Pretty Sammy!!

297
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:38,863
What's the matter, Sammy?

298
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,264
Nothing, just a little chilly.

299
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:45,293
We're almost at Juraihelm. You're
gonna get a little stressed out.

300
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:47,340
What?! We're already there?!

301
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:54,514
Here they come.

302
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:00,385
But I said this
right from the start.

303
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:02,216
Do you remember?

304
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:05,184
"Put something away
for a rainy day."

305
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:12,331
Fire!

306
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,303
Good lunch.

307
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:19,865
Here comes something!

308
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,168
I'll take care of it!

309
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,506
No! My sausages went flying!

310
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:26,478
What are you doing, Johnny?!

311
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:27,843
Taking care of this!

312
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:32,215
It's no use! There's just
too much enemy fire!

313
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:33,616
Can't take care of this!

314
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:42,322
At this rate we'll be shot down!

315
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:44,923
Professor! Isn't there
some kind of ejection device?!

316
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:47,159
Well, we didn't really
have enough space...

317
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:50,295
Got us!!

318
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:53,134
NOW we're REALLY in big trouble!!

319
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,576
Dad!

320
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:07,119
They really got us!!

321
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:25,399
I thought I was a goner!

322
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,741
Th-This is Juraihelm?!

323
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:45,350
No... it's just like hell.

324
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:17,918
Imasara ieta girijanai keredo...

325
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:24,188
...watashi wa warukattawa.

326
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:32,494
Otokowa ikuramo iru, nante...

327
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:36,941
...choushini notte orimashita.

328
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:41,641
Mayonakano juuni-jiwa,

329
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:44,813
Darenidemo yattekuru,

330
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:50,285
...Cinderella dake janai.

331
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:56,762
Imasara ieta giri janai keredo...

332
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,432
...yononaka nametemashita.

333
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:11,476
Konomama nantoka naru, nante...

334
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:16,208
...choushini notte orimashita.

335
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:28,491
We arrived at Juraihelm allright...

336
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:31,428
...but Romio captures all my magic
and my transformation wears off!

337
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:34,592
And the one who saves me
from my crisis is...

338
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,033
Coming next: New Technology

339
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:40,402
A great fusion of magic and science!
