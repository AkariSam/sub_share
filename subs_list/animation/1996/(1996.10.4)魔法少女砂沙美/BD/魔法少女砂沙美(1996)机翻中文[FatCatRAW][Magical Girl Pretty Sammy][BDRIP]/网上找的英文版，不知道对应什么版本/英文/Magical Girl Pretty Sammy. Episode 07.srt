1
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:07,221
I'm Misa. Magical Girl Pixy Misa!

2
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:11,657
Mistress Ramia ordered me to
bully the magical girl, Sammy...

3
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:14,932
...but unfortunately, things
aren't going too well.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,835
However! I'm sly, and not fair!

5
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:21,603
This time I'll get Sammy, for sure!

6
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:25,077
Ramia, watch over me
from the heavens!

7
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:27,015
Don't make it sound
like I'm dead!!

8
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:31,975
Talent for Trouble

9
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:39,593
The experiment has begun.
The Super GPS camera is on.

10
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:44,932
Good. Zoom in.

11
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:48,236
Closer!

12
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:50,831
Closer, closer!

13
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:52,669
There. That's better.

14
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:55,610
That's a bit too close.

15
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,009
I don't think we need
to see the roots.

16
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:01,141
Okay, stop right there.

17
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:03,475
V!

18
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:06,817
Oh, great! Wonderful! Fantastic!

19
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:09,490
Astounding precision,
Professor Washu.

20
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:11,890
You're the greatest genius in America!

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,927
No!

22
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:15,224
You've fallen behind in
your studies, Mr. President.

23
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:19,461
I am the SUPER genius
of all mankind!

24
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:21,729
Oh, I'm the President.

25
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:23,828
She has you there, sir!

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,132
With this satellite...

27
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,009
...our country will have
mastery of the skies!

28
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,446
Just a minute, Mr. President
and assistant!

29
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,911
- You plan to use this
for military purposes?
- Yes... well, uh...

30
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:40,784
Yes.

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,591
Professor! We'll take over
the research from this point!

32
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,827
You're such a pain.

33
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,458
Okay.

34
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:56,470
What have you done?

35
00:01:57,072 --> 00:01:58,106
I...

36
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,040
...just...

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,041
...blew...

38
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,076
...up...

39
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:02,010
...the satellite.

40
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,739
You got it!

41
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,612
What?!
Blew up the satellite?!

42
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:11,576
Our 60 billion dollar project...!

43
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,382
All gone.

44
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:14,683
Mr. President!

45
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:16,018
Peace is best!

46
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:17,183
Newspaper!

47
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,886
Thanks.

48
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,892
A mysterious magical girl
has appeared in Tokyo.

49
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:29,365
Magic? I know what I'm
gonna research next.

50
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,629
President...

51
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:33,674
First of all...

52
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,403
I'll be leaving for Japan now.

53
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:38,105
Wait!

54
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:40,539
Wait a second!
What about the project?!

55
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:48,418
When the heck did she
construct that?!

56
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:52,221
While you and your assistant
were on your nightly dates.

57
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:54,023
- Assistant!
- Mr. President!

58
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,756
Oh, my goodness...!

59
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,732
I'll be in touch with my new address.
I'll leave everything up to you.

60
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:04,298
Professor...!

61
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:08,173
Oh, yeah. Next time we meet,
call me Washu-chan.

62
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:10,911
Washu-chan!

63
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,970
This probably means
the end for our country.

64
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:16,276
Boys and girls.

65
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:18,683
Don't be surprised.

66
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:22,746
We're going to have a special
instructor from the U.S.

67
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,855
Um, you can act
a little surprised.

68
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:32,161
- From America!
- That's great!

69
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,234
I guess she'll speak English, huh?

70
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:35,963
Yeah, perfectly.

71
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:38,028
- That is so cool!
- Yeah.

72
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:40,471
English is so neat.

73
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:41,873
What do you want?

74
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,136
Hiroto, I want you.

75
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:46,737
What are you talking about?

76
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:49,784
Shoot, you make a girl
so embarrassed!

77
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,085
But even so, je t'aime.

78
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,711
That isn't English, is it...?

79
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,279
Teacher, tell us about the instructor.

80
00:03:56,524 --> 00:04:01,826
Let's see. Her name is
Washu Fitzgerald Kobayashi.

81
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:03,164
- Huh?
- It sounds kind of Japanese.

82
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,155
What is it, Sasami?

83
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:08,069
I saw something shining.

84
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,161
Her major is science, so she'll
be teaching our science class.

85
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,700
She's twelve years old...
What?! Twelve years old?!

86
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,298
She's just a kid!

87
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:16,139
There must be some mistake!

88
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,644
But...

89
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,373
A rocket!

90
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:20,937
What the heck is that?!!

91
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:23,416
It's closing in on us!

92
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:25,146
Everyone duck!

93
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:27,944
I'm the only one
not under cover!!

94
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:44,137
W-what's that rocket doing here?!

95
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:46,196
It's against the rules to come
to school by rocket!

96
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:47,901
There's no such rule!

97
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,338
Huh?

98
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,787
People of Japan...

99
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:04,689
Hello!

100
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,885
I'm Washu-chan!

101
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:16,601
I think that's Miss Washu.

102
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:19,899
- That girl is...
-...our teacher?!

103
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,337
You! Got a problem?!

104
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,311
What?! Uh, no!

105
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:27,245
Let's take a look.

106
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:29,875
I'll use my handmade
fish roll telescope.

107
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,575
Seems like a nice teacher.

108
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:38,821
Aha, now I see.

109
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,194
She seems like one
happy teacher.

110
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,253
Don't you think so, Ramia?

111
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,902
Is she asleep?

112
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,396
Then I have no choice.

113
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:52,869
Tsunami...

114
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,474
She's dreaming about me.

115
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,113
Oh, Ramia...

116
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,541
I'll get something to
cover her up with.

117
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,319
Tsunami...

118
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:07,354
I'm gonna kill you!

119
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,814
I'm Principal Miura.

120
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:12,855
Where are you looking?

121
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:14,792
I'm sure you think
I'm old-fashioned...

122
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:16,797
...but Washu something-
or-other Kobayashi?

123
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:17,991
Yo!

124
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:21,001
You graduated from M.I.T.
when you were 10...

125
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:23,037
...so what are you doing here?

126
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,499
I'm on a journey to explore
the depths of Truth...

127
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:28,201
It is the nature of the
solitary hunter.

128
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:30,411
That's a simplified explanation.

129
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:31,446
Study

130
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:33,004
Aha, Sri Lanka.

131
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:37,017
We at Umi no Hoshi Elementary School
would like to hire you on...

132
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,316
...as our special science instructor.
What do you think?

133
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:41,355
Okay.

134
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:44,084
Teachers' salaries in Japan
are low, you know.

135
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:48,295
Well, okay, okay...

136
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:50,732
Okie-dokie, let's play hockey.

137
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,700
Great.
Thank you, thank you.

138
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:56,003
I'll start teaching today.
Catch you later.

139
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:59,174
I fell asleep.
I'm Principal Miura.

140
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,641
Grade 4, Division 3

141
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,575
Okay, how do we read
these characters?
"Tensai" (Natural Disaster)

142
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:05,377
Excuse me!

143
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:08,574
Oh. Yes, can I help you, um...

144
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,245
...Instructor Washu
Fitzgerald Kobayashi?

145
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:14,654
I came to introduce myself,
as the new instructor.

146
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,754
All right, out of my way.

147
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:20,554
That hurts!

148
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:23,291
People in 4-3.

149
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:27,528
I'm the genius girl
from America, Washu Fitz...

150
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,860
That's not how "Genius" is spelled!

151
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,430
I'm the genius girl from America.
"Tensai Oneesan" (Genius Girl)

152
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:36,308
She's nothing but a kid.

153
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:38,470
You're being a little
rash there, Konoha.

154
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:39,672
Huh?

155
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,874
How do you know my name?!

156
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,479
I'm completely aware of
the data on you all.

157
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:48,656
After all, I am... A genius!!

158
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,817
"Tensai Oneesan (Genius Girl)"


159
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:54,357
- What the heck's with her?
- Who knows.

160
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,797
I came here for just one reason.
And that is...

161
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,532
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.

162
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,339
I want to research
Sammy's magic...

163
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,204
...so I can develop
completely new theories.

164
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,980
I want to meet her!

165
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:15,879
Is that right?

166
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,214
Where is Sammy?

167
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,315
I have no idea!

168
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,247
Are you certain?

169
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:23,483
Yes.

170
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:25,492
Oh, no!!

171
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:27,961
What's gotten into her?!

172
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,054
Why?! Doesn't anybody know?!

173
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:32,099
Oh, no!

174
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,667
What is that?

175
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,401
Tsunami... I'll get you.

176
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:42,000
- Here, the flowers, Ramia.
- Sooner or later I'll get you.

177
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:44,445
I'll get you where it counts!

178
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:47,114
Sis! Sis!

179
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:52,782
What should we do
this week, Sis? Sis!

180
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,082
- Do it!
- Huh?

181
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,850
Do it right!

182
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:00,584
Okay, then.
We'll do it, that's all.

183
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:02,720
But...

184
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,765
What is it we have to do?

185
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:12,528
Science Lab

186
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:14,507
Okay, everybody.

187
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:18,605
Starting today, I, Washu
Fitzgerald Kobayashi...

188
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,614
...will teach the science class.

189
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:23,515
How come I've been forced to
stand at the back of the class?

190
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,575
Were you forced back here, too?

191
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:29,180
Isn't it cruel?
And to think that I'm a teacher!

192
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,660
F-forget it.

193
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:35,628
- Student A.
- Yes?

194
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:38,257
Where have you gotten to in class?

195
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,425
Um...

196
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,935
Extracting starch from potatoes.

197
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:45,404
S-s-starch?!

198
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:52,340
I've mastered all of
modern science, and now...

199
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:55,746
Potatoes... and starch?!

200
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:00,613
I can't bear it!
Such worthless science!

201
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:03,657
But this is class time!

202
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,215
Silence!

203
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,188
All right, I'm gonna change
the plan drastically.

204
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:10,423
But the text...!

205
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:14,161
Students can't develop their
individuality if we stick to the text!

206
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:16,593
Prepare all your chemicals.

207
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:21,836
I'm going to show you how
wonderful true science can be.

208
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,007
Come on! Hurry up and do it!

209
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,272
Yes!

210
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,471
Anyway, I've got to do something.

211
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,982
Because disobeying my sister
spells big trouble.

212
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:39,686
Something blew up, Professor!

213
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,729
Okay. Just as I thought.

214
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,963
I've developed a strange liquid!

215
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,692
No problem! Perfect!

216
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,792
Taste this, Professor.

217
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,730
Try a little more soy sauce.

218
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,506
What does this have to do
with science experiments?

219
00:10:57,512 --> 00:11:00,379
And something stinks!
It's terrible!

220
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:10,219
Swaying, swaying,
your heart is swaying.

221
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:15,125
Moving, swaying, feel it swaying.

222
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:18,598
Girls' Washroom

223
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,294
Swaying, swaying...

224
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,696
...my head is swaying.

225
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,966
Aah! I've gotta go!

226
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:32,310
I can't stop this smoke!

227
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:34,911
This strange liquid
melted the floor!

228
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:39,518
Okay, splendid effort!

229
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:43,182
This is quite different from
the class I had planned.

230
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:45,316
Precisely what I had in mind.

231
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:49,027
According to my data, the fastest
way to meet Pretty Sammy...

232
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:52,930
...is to create a disturbance
at this school.

233
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,739
All right, come on out, Sammy!

234
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,475
And use your magic, Sammy!

235
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:05,068
Sammy!

236
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:18,284
What the...?

237
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,889
You're...!

238
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:26,292
Hello!

239
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,634
W-w-what's with that hair?!

240
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,672
I changed my image!

241
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:34,640
- Was it funny, or what?
- What does it matter?!

242
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:37,010
Huh?

243
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:39,111
Oh!

244
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,410
Unbelievable magic reaction!

245
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:43,744
Why?! What exactly are you?!

246
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:46,150
I am Pixy Misa!

247
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,916
I continually seek out a
confusion known as chaos!

248
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,356
I am the goddess of destruction!

249
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:53,387
That's what I am, in a word.

250
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:56,094
You mean, you're a magical girl?

251
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,322
Yes! That's right.

252
00:12:58,499 --> 00:12:59,932
If you're a magical girl...

253
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,060
...then I've got no complaints!
I'll gladly research you!

254
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:06,804
I don't want to be part of your
mad scientist experiments!

255
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:12,371
Calling Mystics!

256
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,611
It's blinding me!

257
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,581
Come on, Chemistry Girl!

258
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:25,051
H, He, Li, Be!

259
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:27,294
A Love-love Monster!

260
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:28,953
What's so " love-love" about it?!

261
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,892
Wow, I'm getting incredible
numbers from her, too!!

262
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,934
Excuse me. Where are
your feet, Chemistry Girl?

263
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:37,804
Those things are mere decoration.
I have no need for them.

264
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,396
I see.

265
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,301
Sink this science girl
in the seas of chaos!

266
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:46,778
Experiments, experiments!
Experiments are fun!

267
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,282
Here it comes! Incredible magic!

268
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,818
What?!

269
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:57,819
It's starch! Starch!

270
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,861
This girl will sink in
a sea of starch!

271
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,929
- S-stop it!
- She's a mixed-up teacher, but...

272
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,523
Be quiet!

273
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,603
Any one who opposes me...
- Experiments are fun! Oh, yeah!

274
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:11,629
...will sink into Starch Hell! Like her.

275
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,932
Great! Incredible!
Never seen energy like this!

276
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,411
Hey, you'd better start worrying!
Or torturing you is pointless!

277
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,347
I'll tell the teacher!
Even though that's me...

278
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,313
What should I do?!
What should I...?!

279
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,750
Sasami!

280
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,651
Transform into Pretty Sammy!

281
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,722
Sasami!

282
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,917
Ryo-Ohki!

283
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:33,790
Transform into Pretty Sammy!

284
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:35,852
You hid there all along,
to tell me that?

285
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,398
Sasami! Transform into Pretty...!

286
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,127
People might notice.
Let's go into the hall.

287
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:41,190
Sasami!

288
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:44,463
Pretty Mutation...

289
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,869
...Magical Recall!

290
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:06,191
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

291
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:09,495
It almost looks kind of fun.

292
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,497
This is no time to fool around!

293
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:16,325
You're putting on a brave face,
but it's all over. Good-bye, scientist.

294
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:17,803
Stop right there!

295
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,738
Count on Sammy when it comes
to science! Pretty Sammy!

296
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,073
I'll come, even in the middle
of an experiment!

297
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,380
Hooray. I've been waiting.

298
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,517
So that's Pretty Sammy!

299
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:34,716
Sammy, this time you're going down!
Chemistry Girl will get you!

300
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,820
I won't let that freak get me!

301
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:40,827
Wrong! This is the end of
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

302
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,522
Starting next week...

303
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:46,066
Pixy Misa and the diary
of her glutinous journeys!

304
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:49,763
You think you can get
good ratings with THAT show?!

305
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:51,527
Enough back talk!

306
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,870
All right, Chemistry Girl!
Show us something cool!

307
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,637
Will do!

308
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,807
No need to hold back,
Chemistry Girl!

309
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:04,578
Okay.

310
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:11,857
What are you doing?!
Hurry and do it!

311
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:13,757
I can't!

312
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:14,817
Why not?

313
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,261
I can't move. I'm a flask.

314
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,292
That can't be!!

315
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,833
- Here's your chance, Sammy!
- Right!

316
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:24,359
Oh, brother. The same old thing.

317
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:26,736
Oh, well. Just get it over with.

318
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:28,067
Miss Misa!

319
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:30,542
- It's over for you!
- T-that's not fair!

320
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:33,942
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

321
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,021
Don't try dangerous experiments!!

322
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,649
You did it!

323
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:51,227
Aah! My data!
My precious data!

324
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,862
My data!

325
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,562
Bye, everyone.
See you next week!

326
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:03,043
Morning already...?

327
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:08,242
Hello?

328
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:10,283
Sis? I'm sorry.

329
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,953
Was this your doing?!

330
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:14,954
You did this on your own?!

331
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,456
That's why the balance
has recovered again!

332
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:20,790
- Oh, I understand. I get it.
Get your butt back here!
- But Sis, you said...

333
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:22,789
Got that?!

334
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:25,998
Flowers... a dream...!

335
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,501
Drat!

336
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,031
Pretty animated teacher, huh?

337
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:39,045
Yeah, but she is going to try
to spy on Sammy's secret, right?

338
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:41,274
Yeah. I'll have to watch out.

339
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:45,950
Hi, Sasami.

340
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,988
You're home.

341
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:51,052
Teacher...!

342
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,490
I came over for a visit.

343
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,929
Sasami, this is Miss Washu.
She just moved next door today.

344
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:58,931
She brought some soba noodles.

345
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,990
You can call me Washu-chan!

346
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:02,660
Oh, Washu-chan, is it?

347
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,363
That's right!

348
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,506
I'm pooped!

349
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:10,100
I can't believe
she moved next door!

350
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:13,209
This is gonna be tough,
from now on.

351
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:16,616
Huh?

352
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:21,084
Hi, Sasami!

353
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:23,555
What are you doing?

354
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:27,624
I was feeling good, so I thought
I'd play my guitar. Want to hear?

355
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:29,595
No thanks.

356
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:31,631
Shoot. She's no fun at all.

357
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:38,235
- Now you can never let your guard down.
- This stinks!!

358
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:43,133
Sammy... Sammy.

359
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,008
I won't give up!

360
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,255
I'll find your secret.

361
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,754
I'll find the secret of magic.

362
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:37,424
Once again, the girl you're watching...

363
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,758
...isn't the real me.

364
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,666
It's a girl...

365
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:52,178
...that was made up...

366
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:58,674
...for you and for our love.

367
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:06,617
You like my honesty.

368
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:12,192
That's what you say...

369
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,530
...but it's an illusion.

370
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,636
Deceiving others is a way of life.

371
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:22,703
It's a woman's romance.

372
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:27,111
I love you more than anyone.

373
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:30,947
I want to show you
a wonderful dream.

374
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:34,385
I love you so much.

375
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,315
I'm going to keep deceiving you.

376
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,988
I'll make you happier...

377
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:48,825
...than any other guy in the world.

378
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:59,309
I go to Misao's house to sleep over.
And there, I'm greeted by...

379
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,348
...a ghost?!

380
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:05,209
N-no problem!
Because I have my magic!

381
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,754
Coming next:
Mid-Summer Santa.

382
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:09,948
Count on Sammy for
ghost extermination!
