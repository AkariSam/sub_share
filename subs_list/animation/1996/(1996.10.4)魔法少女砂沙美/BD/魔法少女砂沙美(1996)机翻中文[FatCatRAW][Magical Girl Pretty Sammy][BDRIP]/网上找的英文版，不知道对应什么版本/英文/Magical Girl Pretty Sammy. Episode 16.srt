1
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:14,434
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:17,301
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:20,765
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,801
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:33,078
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:35,421
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:39,892
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:43,726
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,768
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:50,396
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:54,541
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,304
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:01,148
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:04,718
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:07,482
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:11,187
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:14,652
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:38,442
Dum-de-dum-de-dum...

19
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,082
Just a minute, honey.
It's almost ready.

20
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,729
Time for din-din!

21
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:53,259
Oh, I think Misao from next door
is home from school.

22
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:58,871
You love it when Misao
plays the piano, huh, Saki?

23
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,647
The Team, "Lovely Madams"

24
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:33,338
That was incredible!

25
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:39,538
I didn't know you were
that great a piano player!

26
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:42,574
Thanks, Sasami.

27
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,549
What's that song called?

28
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:46,976
"Misao..."

29
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:49,453
It's called "Misao." Like me.

30
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,458
Dad wrote it for me.

31
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:56,860
Hey, that's right!

32
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:59,827
But, it's not finished yet.

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,166
Dad was so busy with work,
he had to go overseas.

34
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:06,671
Oh. So, when's he coming back?

35
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:11,102
I don't know. He's been gone
since I was small.

36
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:13,570
Misao...

37
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,748
Misao...

38
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:24,423
Oh, somebody's here!

39
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,527
Hello, Misao.

40
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,529
Oh... Your friend's over.

41
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:33,122
- Who's this?
- Miyuki, from next door.

42
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:37,597
I made a little too much dinner,
so I brought you some over.

43
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,799
Thanks very much.

44
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:43,773
Ooh, cabbage rolls!!
Thanks, ma'am!

45
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:47,841
I'm not that old...

46
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,745
Thanks, lady...

47
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:54,780
Blunders! Blunders! Blunders!!

48
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:59,722
Blunders! Blunders!
Bluuun-ders!!

49
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:06,421
Why is that Pixy Misa I was
captivated by so darned weak?!!

50
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:11,299
AAH! INCREDIBLE!!

51
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,373
Incredible! Incredible!
Incredible! Incredible!

52
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,409
Incredible!

53
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,940
Say something, RUMIYA!!!

54
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,548
Sis...?

55
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:25,243
Hm? Did you come up
with a good plan?

56
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:26,307
Let's just give up.

57
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:29,844
Okay. I've given up on
the complicated plan.

58
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,515
Huh?!

59
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,320
That's not what I meant...

60
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:36,829
I'll have to get Misa to
go after Sammy herself.

61
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,625
The Magical Girl Showdown Plan!

62
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,393
N-No...!

63
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:42,401
Misa will just lose again,
on her own!

64
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:45,000
She'll win. No,
I'll make her win!

65
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,997
I'll be in on it this time, too.

66
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:52,841
Sis, that outfit's
a bit over the top...

67
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,106
Think so?

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,455
Rumiya. Make Misao
transform into Misa...

69
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:06,617
...then get her to write
a challenge to Sammy.

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,487
Aren't you going, Sis?

71
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:11,496
I've got lots of preparations
to take care of, for this plan.

72
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:14,428
JUST GET GOING!!

73
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,128
Okay!!

74
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,442
Oh, Yumi. Haven't you
gone home, yet?

75
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:28,606
No, she's waiting for
her husband. Right?

76
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:29,943
Yes, I am.

77
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:33,474
Oh, yeah. You just got
married, didn't you.

78
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:35,714
You married while you're still
a student, right? Are you happy?

79
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:39,686
Yes. We're going to see a play
today. I can't wait.

80
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,353
It's like she's got the
monopoly on happiness.

81
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,624
Let's get going, and not
be rude. See you, Yumi.

82
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:46,164
Bye.

83
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:50,635
Gotcha. You!

84
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,432
Huh?

85
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:53,403
What?!

86
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,571
Open up wide!

87
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:01,412
Eat your fill!

88
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:02,914
Well? Do you like it?

89
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:05,712
Yeth! Your cooking's the betht, Yukie!

90
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,548
Ooh, I'm so happy!

91
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,822
I love you, Toru!
"HEAD BUTT"

92
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:11,157
I'm so happy we got married, Toru!
"ELBOW"

93
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:11,991
"BODY SLAM"

94
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,553
Ooh, that IS delicious.

95
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:18,597
What a wonderful wife,
balancing a job and housework.

96
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:22,001
Who're you?

97
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,737
Se-cret!

98
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:27,096
Whoah!

99
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,905
What a babe!!

100
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:33,546
I did it again!

101
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,046
It's a crime, being beautiful.

102
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,611
But my heart and soul
belong to this man.

103
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:48,193
CAST!

104
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,358
REEL IN!

105
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,193
Who would've thought that the
one who's stealing you from me...

106
00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:00,372
...that the person I hated...

107
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:05,769
...would be a man?

108
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:08,576
How about giving it a rest?

109
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:12,948
I've gotta train before I make
my debut as a housewife singer!

110
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,919
Okay, thirty more songs!!

111
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,149
What a fantastic policy.

112
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:22,092
Who're you? Oh, a talent scout?!

113
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:26,098
Exactly. But not from an
entertainment company.

114
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,190
Huh?

115
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:30,029
- HERE IT COMES!!!
- Chihiro!!

116
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:35,304
Satoshi should be home soon.

117
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:43,104
Welcome home, dear. Would you like
a bath, first? Or dinner?

118
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:45,451
Ha, ha! Just kidding!

119
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:46,843
Huh?

120
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:49,822
I'm coming in to visit.

121
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,291
Um, if this is door-to-door sales
or something, then no, thanks.

122
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,994
It's nothing like that.

123
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,689
Then what do you want?

124
00:07:57,764 --> 00:08:01,325
You've passed my inspection.
Congratulations.

125
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,134
Inspection...?

126
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:05,933
The inspection to become part
of the Pixy Misa Team.

127
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:10,465
In a word, you're a soldier of
love to support a magical girl.

128
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,573
W-What is this?!

129
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:14,510
Get in there!

130
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:17,311
Hey! What do you plan
on doing with us?!!

131
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,548
I'll let you go soon enough.

132
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,418
But before that, there are some
things I'd like you to do.

133
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:25,385
Things you'd like us to do...?!

134
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,018
You always spend so much energy...

135
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:30,858
...on your husbands and children.

136
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:34,926
That energy is very strong.
It's enough to drive me mad!!

137
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,598
D-Do you think so...?

138
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,900
Hey, this is no time to blush!

139
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:46,409
So won't you lend that power
of yours to Pixy Misa for a bit?

140
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:48,781
Magical Eyes!!

141
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:53,847
I'm home!

142
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,888
Miyuki? Aren't you here?

143
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,780
Hi, honey.

144
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,848
Oh, there you are. Hi.

145
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:04,359
See ya, Misao.

146
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,660
Yeah, see you at school tomorrow.

147
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:07,893
Okay.

148
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,696
Dad!

149
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,329
Good timing! Let's go
home together, Sasami.

150
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:14,668
See ya!

151
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,368
Good night!

152
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:18,735
G-Good night...

153
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:22,908
Her dad... how lucky.

154
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,753
Birdie.

155
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:33,591
Birdie, I played the piano for
Sasami today for the first time.

156
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:37,795
I was so happy, because she
praised me and said I was good.

157
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,757
Dad and Mom are busy with work,
so they're never home.

158
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,268
But I'm not lonely.

159
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:47,795
Because Sasami and you
come to see me.

160
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:49,904
So I'm not lonely.

161
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:51,273
Misao...

162
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,939
Pretty funny, huh, Birdie.
I'm saying all this...

163
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,743
...but you can't understand.

164
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,149
Are you gonna cheer me up?

165
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:05,915
This girl's lonely. She's just
always covering it up.

166
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:07,550
RUMIYA!!!

167
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,725
What're you doing, Rumiya?!

168
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,767
Uh, nothing, I... nothing...

169
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,961
I don't have a clue
what you're saying!

170
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,833
Hurry up and make her
transform, or else!

171
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,873
Or else what?

172
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:28,814
What...?

173
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:33,350
Sasami Kawai... or, rather,
Pretty Sammy!

174
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,354
Today's the end of your pursuits.
Tomorrow's Friday!

175
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:38,583
Yes! The showdown's on Friday!!

176
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,371
Dinner's scrump-dilly-ishus,
once again, Honoka!

177
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,604
It's so good! I'm happy!

178
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:06,014
Bonding with my girl
through Sumo wrestling!!

179
00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:10,178
She pushed him over!
I'm happy!

180
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:13,792
Everybody!
Let's sing karaoke!!

181
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,725
A beautiful love song!

182
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:17,660
With a chorus! So happy!!

183
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,492
Happy!

184
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:25,632
Haaa-ppy!

185
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,208
Ooh, we were happy!

186
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:31,937
And I've got no homework.
I'm gonna hit the sack.

187
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,640
Huh? It's warm in here...

188
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,749
Good evening, Sasami!

189
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:43,955
Oh, that's a bad sleeping posture.

190
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:45,752
What are you doing here, Misa?!

191
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:48,720
Sorry! Actually, I came to
bring this over.

192
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,591
- "A letter of challenge?"
- A challenge to duel?

193
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:55,058
That's right! Precisely!

194
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:58,831
Tomorrow after classes,
on the school grounds.

195
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:01,305
See you! Bye!

196
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,404
Hey, what does the letter say?

197
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:09,213
"Sasami the Fool."

198
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,418
How maddening!!

199
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:18,155
Calling all people carrying out
their ordinary lives...

200
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:21,682
...I bring this big announcement!

201
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:24,589
That girl who's posing as good
to be popular amongst you...

202
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,632
... timid Pretty Sammy...

203
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,860
...is about to have
a magical girl showdown...

204
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:32,871
...against Pixy Misa, goddess of
destruction, and lover of chaos...

205
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:36,067
...at the Umi no Hoshi
Elementary School grounds.

206
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:39,536
For those wishing to see Sammy
bawl her eyes out...

207
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,706
...we extend a warm welcome.

208
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:48,409
PIXY MISA VERSUS
Pretty Sammy

209
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,333
Judging Official

210
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:03,895
Peace...!?

211
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:10,465
She's here! It's Pixy Misa!

212
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:12,511
With bad manners, as usual!

213
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:16,979
Boo!!

214
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,986
Thank you! Thanks for
your warm welcome!

215
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:21,886
Boo!!

216
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,623
Super-Shut up!!

217
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:29,359
Come on, Pretty Sammy!

218
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:34,127
I'll teach you which of us is
the greatest magical girl!!

219
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:38,630
Listen to her, Sasami!!
You're not going home, are you?!

220
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:42,771
Misao took the day off school today.
I thought I'd go visit her.

221
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:44,475
But what about Misa?!

222
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:46,705
She'll probably go home,
if I just ignore her.

223
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,010
This is your chance to teach
Misa a lesson! Give it a try!

224
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:53,950
If you get rid of Misa, you won't
have to transform anymore!

225
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,611
Please?

226
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:56,814
I guess I can't avoid it.

227
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:58,820
Here you go!

228
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:06,164
Pretty Mutation...

229
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,397
...Magical Recall!

230
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:26,541
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

231
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:31,517
Terribly sorry to keep
you waiting!

232
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,923
Leave it to Sammy, when it
comes to magical battles!

233
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:39,891
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!
Here, along with everyone else!

234
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:42,067
You made it, Sammy!

235
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:46,235
Good luck, Sammy!

236
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,966
Go ahead and lose, Misa!

237
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,530
Good luck, to both of you!

238
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:52,169
Ooh, the data's just rolling in!

239
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,768
La-la-la-la...!

240
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,511
Today's the end of our friendship.

241
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:00,008
We never had any friendship!

242
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:01,576
Oh, yeah. That's right.

243
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,417
Misa, give me your word!

244
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,788
That if I win, you'll never
bother people again!

245
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:08,984
All right.

246
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:12,394
But only if you can beat me!
Here goes!

247
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,433
Sammy, prepare to lose!!

248
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,296
Sammy!!

249
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:23,172
OW!!!

250
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:26,769
Ow! Ow! The pain! The pain!

251
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:28,478
She's weak...!

252
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:31,481
Why, you... why, you...!
How could you?!!

253
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:35,215
Promise me! You won't
bother people any more!

254
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:37,419
I'm pulling out all stops, now!

255
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,220
Love-love Monsters!
Please come out!

256
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:43,989
Haphazardly Calling Mystics!

257
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,701
Morals!

258
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,799
Obey them!

259
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:54,305
What?!

260
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:55,840
Obey your morals!

261
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:57,633
Take that!

262
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:00,607
Morals!

263
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,582
Ooh, Cigarette Butt Girl
and Empty Can Girl!

264
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,914
Sammy, you're such a mean girl!

265
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,020
Now, give me your word!

266
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:12,156
Do her in, Sammy!

267
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:15,856
You've gotta make sure she
never bothers people again!!

268
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:17,987
Beat the hell out of her,
if you have to!!

269
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:19,991
Misa!

270
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,359
Run for it, Misa!

271
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:22,458
Ru...!

272
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,503
I won't let her!

273
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,295
Let me go! Ryo-Ohki!

274
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,766
What?! How do you
know my name?!

275
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,470
'C-Cause, uh...

276
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:35,446
Who the heck is summoning
Pixy Misa?!

277
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,783
What's going on, Misa?!

278
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:42,346
Come on! Answer me!

279
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:45,282
I'm a crab... I'm a crab... part 2...

280
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:48,292
What...?

281
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:51,695
It's beautiful!

282
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:53,493
Ooh, this is incredible!!

283
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:56,458
- What is it?!
- Look at that!

284
00:16:58,604 --> 00:17:00,902
Nice to meet you,
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

285
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:04,503
We're the beautiful and bewitching
messengers of love...

286
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,875
...and we've come
to protect Pixy Misa.

287
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,510
And also to blow you out
of the ring, Sammy.

288
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,915
We call ourselves the
"Lovely Mrs. Team."

289
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:14,843
Or put simply...

290
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:17,355
The Team, "Lovely Madams!"

291
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,814
Yeah!

292
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,690
The Team, "Lovely Madams?!"

293
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,092
They're right about being lovely!

294
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:24,720
Yeah, those are lovely wives...

295
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:27,459
And she's also...
...a wife?!

296
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,759
Lovely Mrs...

297
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:35,170
Right. We're your allies. Leave it
to the Team, "Lovely Madams!"

298
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,300
You sit back and have
a nap or something.

299
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,638
Let's do it, gals!

300
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:39,905
Yo!!

301
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,906
Lovely Madams' Shopping Basket!!

302
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,949
It's so dark! I can't see a thing!

303
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,984
Lovely Madams' Wink!

304
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:47,450
What's going on?!

305
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
Lovely Madams' Dunk!

306
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:54,884
Mrs. Song!!

307
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,322
Lovely Madams'
Throwing Star Business Card!

308
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:00,865
Hey, stop! Hey! Please!
No! Stop!

309
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:07,436
They're strong! I can't
figure out their principles...

310
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:08,973
...but they're unbelievably strong!

311
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:13,438
Well, Sammy? Understand the powers
of the cornered magical girl, better?

312
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:15,446
YOU haven't done a thing, Misa!!

313
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:19,148
Sammy! Your only choice is to get them
with your lethal technique!!

314
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:20,242
Mm-hm!

315
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:23,351
Converge, magic powers of justice!

316
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,241
It's Sammy's Pretty Space!

317
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,244
It's pretty every time
we see it, right, Honoka?

318
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:47,711
Sure is!

319
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,146
This is dangerous!
What're you gonna do, Mrs.?

320
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:55,085
This pretty space thing
won't work on us wives.

321
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:57,445
Okay, gals! Let's do our thing!

322
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,252
Right!

323
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:00,815
Converge, magical seduction!

324
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:03,361
Which we call,
"Early Afternoon Magic!"

325
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,561
What's happening?!!

326
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:10,295
My Pretty Space...!

327
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:11,961
It's disappearing!

328
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:17,004
Whoah! This energy's unreal! It's way
stronger than Sammy's magical energy!!

329
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,411
This is the Team,
"Lovely Madams?!"

330
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:26,877
This is our Lovely Space!

331
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:34,558
Pretty Space was so childish
in comparison...!

332
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,188
You're not kidding.

333
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,628
That's not true! I can do better!!

334
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:40,898
No, Sammy!

335
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,562
What a cute little attack.

336
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:46,605
No wonder they call you "Pretty."

337
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:52,376
Super-fantastic, Lovely Mrs.!

338
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:56,574
Well, Sammy? Had about enough?
I'm sure you have!

339
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:03,145
Sammy! Don't give up!

340
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:06,680
It's useless if I can't even do
my lethal technique, Ryo-Okhi.

341
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:08,655
She's exactly right!

342
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:11,594
Ooh, Sammy lost...!

343
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:21,439
Oh...

344
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:26,102
Misa's special super-dupervictory!

345
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,380
Although you didn't lift a finger...

346
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,722
And so, Sammy the magical girl
was defeated by the assault...

347
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,054
...of the Lovely Madams,
who suddenly appeared!

348
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:43,456
Will Sammy be done in by Misa?

349
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:46,556
Don't give in!
Don't give in, Sammy!

350
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:50,033
You can't lose, Sammy!
Please don't lose!!

351
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,930
The whole world wants your smile!

352
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,269
It really does...!!!

353
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:18,325
It maybe too late, saying this
after such a long time...

354
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:24,594
...but I was wrong.

355
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:32,775
To say there are any number
of guys out there...

356
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:37,248
...I should've known better.

357
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:42,082
Midnight,

358
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:45,048
Comes to anyone,

359
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:50,593
...not only to Cinderella.

360
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:57,125
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

361
00:21:58,003 --> 00:22:03,999
...but I've made light
of the whole world.

362
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:11,813
To think that somehow things
would turn out all right...

363
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:16,844
...I should've known better.

364
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:28,992
I was completely crushed by
the Team, "Lovely Madams!"

365
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:33,562
They say the power of love is
needed to get out of that mess.

366
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,631
But I'm just a kid, so I don't know
about things like that...

367
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:40,671
Coming next: Farewell, The Team,
"Lovely Madams."
