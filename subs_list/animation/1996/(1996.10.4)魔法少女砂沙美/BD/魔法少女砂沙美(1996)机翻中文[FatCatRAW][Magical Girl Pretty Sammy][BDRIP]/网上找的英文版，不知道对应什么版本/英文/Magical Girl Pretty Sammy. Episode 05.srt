1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,264
Hello.

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,901
I'm a candidate to be queen
of a magical kingdom.

3
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:08,945
My name is Tsunami.

4
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:12,109
For me to become
the official queen...

5
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:17,347
...the earthling Sasami Kawai must
become magical girl "Pretty Sammy"...

6
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:19,389
...and work very hard.

7
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:22,587
At first I was nervous
about meeting her.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,928
But when I gave her the baton...

9
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:27,657
"Thanks! I'll do my best!!"

10
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:31,394
I was so impressed by
her sincere attitude.

11
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:34,465
Sasami? I mean, Pretty Sammy.

12
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:37,773
Don't give in to the evil
magical girl, Pixy Misa.

13
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:40,503
Do your best to restore peace
to the Earth.

14
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:44,615
Is it just me, or is her version
a bit off the mark...?

15
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:49,575
Debut! The Star Sammy

16
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:57,056
She's so swanky, and I'm so cool.

17
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:03,427
Let's take a parasol and
go fishing, shall we?

18
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,827
Good, Karaoke Girl!
Keep after Sammy!

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,308
I can't attack her
with that going on!

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,236
Uh-oh!

21
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,279
What? What's the matter?

22
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,939
Please select a song.

23
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,678
- Now, Sammy!
- Right!

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,018
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

25
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:27,886
Darn!

26
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,220
That rotten girl!

27
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:31,921
Keep those requests coming!

28
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:38,127
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!
Today's problem is solved!

29
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:41,994
Terrific. She's fantastic.

30
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,937
Sasami. Sammy's getting
pretty good at this.

31
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,380
Yeah, whatever.

32
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,217
I just wish this would happen
where no one can recognize me.

33
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:01,883
Otherwise someone's bound
to find out that I'm Sammy.

34
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:06,863
Nobody saw me, did they?

35
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,429
Where've you been, Sasami?

36
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,928
D-Dad!

37
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:13,799
I saw.

38
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:15,839
Huh?! S-saw what?

39
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:17,874
Pretty Sammy.

40
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:20,205
Does he know that
I'm Pretty Sammy?!

41
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:25,810
So that's the famous magical girl.
She looks a lot like you, Sasami.

42
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,480
Must be my imagination.

43
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,519
Right! Your imagination!

44
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:33,418
Besides, I didn't see her.

45
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,687
Really? Well, I got her on video.
We'll watch it together.

46
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:39,723
Don't want to?

47
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:41,355
Well, uh...

48
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:44,526
Yeah, let's see it.
I've really wanted to see her!

49
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:47,928
- That reminds me.
- What?

50
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,673
Where did you get to, Sasami?

51
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,833
I dunno, Daddy!

52
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:57,210
Oh! What a cute pose!

53
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:59,812
I dunno! I dunno!

54
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:01,851
Sorry, Sasami.
The battery's dead.

55
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:07,122
The True Identity of the
Mysterious Magical Girl...?

56
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:11,283
What's wrong, Mom?

57
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:14,819
Well, sales at the shop
are down a bit.

58
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:16,798
Is everything all right?

59
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,859
We're not in the red, but
we've got to do something.

60
00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:21,905
Rest assured, members
of the Kawai family.

61
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,465
I have a good idea!

62
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:26,570
Kind of.

63
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,406
Pretty Sammy is here!

64
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,037
You won't get away with this!

65
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:32,014
This is it.

66
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,155
Oh! What the heck...?!

67
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,089
Pretty Sammy Debut CD!
Special Sales Event

68
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:41,985
Pretty good, huh?

69
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:45,551
Pretty Sammy's debut event.
We'll have it at our shop.

70
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,395
Ugh!!

71
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,830
It's wonderful, Ginji!

72
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,497
This will definitely bring
customers to the shop!

73
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:57,938
Fallen in love with me again?

74
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,976
Yes!

75
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,936
You can't decide this on your own!

76
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:05,378
Why not?

77
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,386
Uh... um, what I meant was...
I wonder if you should decide...

78
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:13,252
...without consulting Sammy first?

79
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:17,517
She's got a point.

80
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,061
Don't worry about it.

81
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:19,925
Huh?

82
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:24,024
That magical girl fights for Good.
It was in your class paper.

83
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,002
We're in trouble, and Sammy
will come to our rescue.

84
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,560
Definitely!

85
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,970
B-but...

86
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,009
Definitely!

87
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:35,603
Our worries about the shop
will be over!

88
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:38,379
Exactly!

89
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:40,313
But, uh...

90
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:43,012
At times like this,
you're so dependable, Ginji.

91
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:45,054
You're so wonderful.

92
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:51,627
Oh, boy. They're sure off
in their own little world.

93
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,692
Come, one and all!

94
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:04,734
What to do...?

95
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:14,650
Darn you, Pretty Sammy!
You've ruined my fantastic plan!

96
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,686
Just watch me now!

97
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:23,685
Faffufe, fif!
Foo faf fif!

98
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:26,790
Take that out of your mouth,
then we'll talk.

99
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,394
There, I'm back to normal.

100
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:33,903
Bad news, Sis!
Look at this!

101
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:36,573
What are you freaking out for?

102
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:41,203
What's this?! Sammy's
making her star debut?!

103
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:42,142
That's right.

104
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,203
What's Tsunami thinking, anyway?

105
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,114
What's this got to do with
Gemini's balance?

106
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:48,116
Who knows.

107
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,812
Oh, well.

108
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,616
Are you going to
interfere again?

109
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:52,985
- So?
- Huh?

110
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:56,583
You know I am, so what did
you come back here for?

111
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,991
S-Sis...

112
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:01,053
You can't always wait for
someone to tell you what to do!

113
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:03,599
Hurry up and give Misa her orders!

114
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,431
You're too rough on people!

115
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:09,367
Umi no Hoshi
Shopping District

116
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,303
Today's the day, and
I haven't slept a wink!

117
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:20,350
I hate mornings, now...

118
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,751
Pretty Sammy Show

119
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:40,126
If this is a dream, then
please let me wake up soon.

120
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:44,597
Good morning!

121
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:48,209
I'm going to see Sammy
for sure, Kawai!

122
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,013
I bought a 600 mm.
camera lens for this!

123
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,215
To take what?

124
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,082
A-all kinds of shots.

125
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,854
We'll be her biggest fans!

126
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,249
Kenji!

127
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,259
It's getting worse and worse!

128
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:04,794
Your camera's awesome!

129
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:07,887
I wonder if something's
wrong with Sasami...

130
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,329
Am I really going to
make my star debut?

131
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:18,306
I wanted to be a normal kid,
not a star or a magical girl.

132
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:22,668
No, I've got to stop worrying
and give this a try!

133
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,010
I'm gonna be a star!

134
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:27,611
After my debut,
I'll have a TV show!

135
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:31,120
And dramas! Commercials!
Tons of CDs!

136
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:34,123
I'll be in magazines!
Video games! Films!

137
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,126
Oh, this is so exciting,
when I think about it!

138
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:39,958
Yeah, right. Like that's
ever gonna happen.

139
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:47,433
Maybe a meteorite will hit,
then the event will be canceled.

140
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:51,873
I can sympathize with kids who can't
run, and want to skip sports day.

141
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:54,802
The stage is just
around that corner...

142
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,606
Please, God! Make all traces
of the stage disappear!

143
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:01,913
If you do, I'll do anything for
you, for the rest of my life!

144
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,525
The stage is gone!!

145
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,164
Beloved God!
You heard my prayer!

146
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:20,863
Sasami.

147
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:25,697
What's going on, with all these
ups and downs of yours?

148
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,738
If you were here, why didn't
you say something?!

149
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:31,974
I didn't want to interfere.

150
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,450
Anyway, look at this!
The stage has disappeared!

151
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,578
So the event has been
canceled, right?

152
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:40,549
That'd be nice if it were true.

153
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,084
Wha...?

154
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:57,907
Okay, camera one!

155
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:04,373
The TV crews came, saying they
wanted to broadcast the debut!

156
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:06,814
Ugh!

157
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:11,413
I was a fool to believe in God.

158
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:12,785
Fool

159
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,326
Kawai Family

160
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,191
Who would've thought
TV crews would come?!

161
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:21,297
Everything's going so smoothly!

162
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:25,166
- It's guaranteed to be a success!
- Yes!

163
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:28,897
Dad? Mom?

164
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,371
Hi, Sasami.

165
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,965
This is getting pretty big, isn't it?

166
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,505
The TV stations said they want
to cover Sammy's debut.

167
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:39,674
I didn't expect this much response.

168
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:45,444
What if... I only mean "if"...
What if Sammy didn't show up?

169
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:49,417
She might be so busy that
she can't make it here.

170
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,087
Don't worry, she'll come.

171
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:56,155
But I just mean, what if...?

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,596
Well, in that case, the TV crews
would be disappointed...

173
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:05,705
...not to mention the audience.

174
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,265
Yeah...

175
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:10,404
Our shop's reputation
would be damaged.

176
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:15,410
We'd become poor, so we'd
be kicked out of our house.

177
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:29,893
It's hard to work when times
are so tough for us.

178
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,730
Would you like some flowers?

179
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,997
Please buy my flowers!

180
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:38,531
If only Sammy had come,
back then...

181
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,735
We promised never to
speak about that again.

182
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,307
That's what!

183
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:54,252
It's no use!
There's no way out!

184
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,053
Wonder where everyone is?

185
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:05,333
Look, isn't this a great costume?

186
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:06,801
You're stupid, too.

187
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,370
"Too"...?

188
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,600
You mean, I'm stupid too...?

189
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,402
Hey, you two!

190
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:15,035
The school rule says that you
must wear uniforms off grounds.

191
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,642
What are you supposed to be, anyway?

192
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:20,144
The two of us are...

193
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,110
...Pretty Double Sammy!

194
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:26,321
Idiots.

195
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,685
I've got to hurry!

196
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,536
It's starting!

197
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,317
This is a very lucky day in 1996.

198
00:11:56,386 --> 00:12:00,982
The last superstar of the century
is making her appearance today!

199
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:02,490
The astonishing debut event!

200
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,495
Let the 'Magical Girl
Pretty Sammy Show' begin!

201
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:09,465
It's started.

202
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:13,025
What're you gonna do?

203
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:14,400
I don't know.

204
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,199
If you're going on stage,
you'd better transform soon.

205
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:22,645
You REALLY don't
wanna go, huh...

206
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:27,539
Let's call Sammy on stage.
Ready for the countdown?!

207
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,315
Then let's do it!

208
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:33,481
Three... two...

209
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,285
...one!

210
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,452
Just a moment, please!

211
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:40,485
What...?

212
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,395
Up there!

213
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:47,993
Sorry!

214
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,404
Unfortunately, this is
the end of the event.

215
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:55,534
W-who are you?

216
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,976
My name is Pixy Misa!

217
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:03,247
It's a pity, but I can't allow
Sammy to become a star!

218
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:06,153
Trust the TV stations!
Very well-crafted!

219
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,712
Yes!

220
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:11,184
- But, wait a minute...
- Shut up!

221
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:15,831
Go, Love-love Monster!
Pro Karaoke Girl!

222
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,894
Here's a song you'll know!

223
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:19,524
A Love-love Monster!

224
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,470
D-d-d-dynamite!

225
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:29,268
S-s-s-sexy!

226
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,004
Dad! Mom!

227
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:33,709
Sasami! Transform!

228
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:35,313
Yeah!

229
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:40,323
Pretty Mutation...

230
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,615
...Magical Recall!

231
00:13:57,574 --> 00:14:00,475
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

232
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:07,843
So much for your plan to
become a star, Sammy!

233
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,612
Stop this, Pixy Misa!

234
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:11,415
I know that pretty voice...

235
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,853
This has all happened
so quickly.

236
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:20,825
I'm... so... flustered.

237
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:24,898
But I'm Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

238
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,527
And this is my grand debut!

239
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,630
So you came, Pretty Sammy!

240
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:32,475
If you think you're
gonna be a star...

241
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:33,442
SAMMY!

242
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,003
I love Sammy!
...you're wrong!

243
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:44,819
T-they've all come...
...to see ME.

244
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:48,784
I know how they
feel about me.

245
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:53,660
So many people are
cheering for me.

246
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:57,290
I'm so glad I became a star!

247
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:02,299
Why are you enjoying the moment?!
Quit ignoring me!

248
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:05,239
Oops. I'm sorry.

249
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:07,701
"Oops," my foot!

250
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:11,508
I'll embarrass you in front of
this huge audience.

251
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:14,379
Then you'll stop even thinking
about becoming a star!

252
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:18,646
It wasn't like it was my idea.

253
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:21,519
Don't waste your breath!
Pro Karaoke Girl!

254
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:23,381
Yes!

255
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,186
This time will be
a little different.

256
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,266
She's a pro version, not a plain
karaoke machine, like before!

257
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:30,891
Pro

258
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:34,825
She has a function that
allows one singer to harmonize.

259
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:39,341
And she can fix singers
that are out of synch!

260
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:41,770
What's all that for?

261
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:43,537
Shut up!

262
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:46,810
This time I've made all the
selections I can make!

263
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,113
Hit it, Pro Karaoke Girl!

264
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:51,085
Groovy Monkey!

265
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,587
Making Selection

266
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:55,215
Pro Karaoke Girl's Song

267
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,633
Seasons hidden by the driedgrass.

268
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,633
Passion dripping from
my fingertips.

269
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:14,575
If I keep trying...

270
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:18,438
...I'll soon awake.

271
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:23,611
I'd better use the Pretty
Coquettish Bomber, already!

272
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:29,214
I can't uncover my ears!
What am I gonna do!?

273
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:34,162
You can't use your hands
or your feet!

274
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:37,555
What?!

275
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:41,594
Dad!

276
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,639
Pretty Sammy! Fight back
with one of your songs!

277
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:47,107
Yeah, Sammy! Do it!
Sing, Sammy!

278
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,348
Sing, Sammy!

279
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:57,080
Do it, Sammy! Sing!

280
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:01,687
All right, everyone. I'll sing.

281
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:04,249
I'll sing for you all!
I'll sing for peace!

282
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:09,322
I wish I could...

283
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:16,369
...think only of you.

284
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:18,297
But suddenly...

285
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:21,468
...in the middle...

286
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,812
...of our date...

287
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,182
...I have to leave again.

288
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,884
I'm so sorry.

289
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:41,556
Some bad guys come...

290
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:44,026
...and rough up our world.

291
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:48,538
In that case...
here's some mike feedback!

292
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:53,407
But I'll have to protect the peace.

293
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,410
It's not working!

294
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:58,780
It may be a small heart...

295
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:02,311
But it will restore the world,
little by little.

296
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,813
I'll teach those fools...

297
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:09,517
... the power of love!

298
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,691
Looks like trouble. Hang in there.
A girl who can transform...

299
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:14,864
Don't leave me!

300
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:16,161
...is stronger than a bull!

301
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:21,199
Pretty Coquettish Bomber!

302
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,465
Time extension, please-e-e!

303
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,666
Leave it to Sammy,
for magic and singing!

304
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:49,591
You're useless!

305
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:56,765
Great concert, wasn't it, Honoka?

306
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,268
Sales at the shop have doubled!

307
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:03,846
Well! Let's sing a song!

308
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:05,540
All right.

309
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:08,982
How do I let myself get caught
up in things like that?!

310
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:11,145
I can't believe I did
something so embarrassing!

311
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:15,821
Don't worry about it.
Everybody had a great time.

312
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,622
And listen! Your mom and dad
are singing.

313
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:21,292
I've had enough songs!

314
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:25,057
But maybe being a star
isn't so bad!
