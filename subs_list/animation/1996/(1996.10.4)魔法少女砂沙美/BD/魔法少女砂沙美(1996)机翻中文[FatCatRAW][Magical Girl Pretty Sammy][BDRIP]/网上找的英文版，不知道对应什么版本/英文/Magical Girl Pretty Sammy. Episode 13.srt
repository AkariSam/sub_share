00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:14,579
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,514
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:20,942
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,977
... tsukai you!

5
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:33,223
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:35,566
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:40,036
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

8
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:43,871
...demae niyatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,912
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,540
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:54,719
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,482
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,292
...genki ni nareruwa.

14
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:04,896
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

15
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:07,660
Fushigi na chikara ga.

16
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:11,490
Yume mireba yume mo...

17
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,837
...yume janai.

18
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,357
A wooden building.
That'll be tough.

19
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:43,991
- It'll be okay!
- Huh?

20
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:48,004
Take a look! Isn't he brave?!
That's Ginji, my husband.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,467
Gin... ji...?

22
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:59,342
H-Hey! Put those down!
People's lives are at stake!

23
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,044
It's okay!

24
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:05,989
Incredible...!

25
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:08,048
He leads the Kawai family,
after all!

26
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,788
- Bingo!
- Cool!

27
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:14,627
Ginji! I'm absolutely melting!

28
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,466
Mihoshi Mizutani

29
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:22,573
Huh...?

30
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:27,567
All I Want Is You

31
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,641
It's Sunday! Today's Sunday!

32
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:39,216
I don't have to get up early.
My precious time to myself!

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,728
Bon appetit!

34
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,995
You still don't get it, bonehead?!

35
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,002
I was wrong, sir!

36
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,029
Listen, Sato. You are NOT
a rotten apple, okay?

37
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:57,369
Sir...!

38
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:01,310
Ridiculous! There aren't any fervent
teachers like that, these days.

39
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,040
Oh...?

40
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:06,606
The teacher in charge of the
class next door acts fervent...

41
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:08,948
Ooh, sounds like
a fantastic teacher.

42
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,954
She's only getting
excited with herself.

43
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:13,320
If you look at it objectively,
it's nothing but a nuisance.

44
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,619
Huh?

45
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,929
T-The fervent teacher!

46
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,557
How did... where
did you come from?!

47
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,064
Well actually,
my apartment burned down.

48
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:29,095
So I thought I'd come and see
if I could stay with you.

49
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,906
You're the only one I could ask!

50
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:34,467
Oh. Well, that's just awful.

51
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:36,308
Kiyone!

52
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,138
Whoah! Whoah!

53
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:43,920
What did you do that for, Kiyone?

54
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,123
And don't come back!!

55
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,390
My precious, unbelievably
precious time to myself...!!

56
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:57,399
As if I'm gonna let someone
like Mihoshi ruin it!

57
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:59,135
Huh?

58
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,006
Hello, Amayuri residence.

59
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:07,067
Oh, Kiyone's mother?
I'm Mihoshi!

60
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:10,512
Yes! I'll be staying with
Kiyone for a little while.

61
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:13,448
Don't be so sure!
Here, give me that!

62
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:16,153
Hi, Mom?

63
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:19,487
What? Say that again...

64
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:22,458
Like I said, it's about
time for you to do it.

65
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:25,462
You can't stay single forever,
you know.

66
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,657
So I've set up a meeting
for your arranged marriage.

67
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,165
What?! Arranged marriage?!

68
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,633
It was out of your mom 's
love, dear. Out of love!

69
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:33,670
You are one lucky lady!

70
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:37,104
I have no interest in
arranged marriage.

71
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:40,110
Oh, what a shame.
The fellow is so handsome...

72
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:42,112
...you'll want to pounce on him!

73
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,613
Oh...!

74
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:44,545
Really?

75
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:45,809
Really, I'm telling you.

76
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:48,977
He saw your photograph,
and seemed very interested.

77
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:50,680
How charitable.

78
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,086
What's that supposed to mean?!

79
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,556
Anyway, you'll get
his picture, soon.

80
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:57,117
Miss Amayuri, special delivery.

81
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:58,127
Coming!

82
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:00,528
The day's set for the holiday,
the day after tomorrow.

83
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:02,429
T-That soon?

84
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,697
I've already set up your meeting,
SO GO AND GET THAT MAN!

85
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,533
- Bye!
- Wait, Mom!

86
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,232
Here, Kiyone!

87
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,169
Wow!

88
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,975
It's not that big a deal...

89
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:19,010
What...?!

90
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,351
Andou Toyokawa, 28 years old

91
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,580
Wow! What a nice-looking guy!!

92
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,588
H-He's nothing.

93
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,988
"Andou Toyokawa. 28 years old."

94
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,628
Wow! He graduated from
Harvard University.

95
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:35,655
And he's a first-rate violinist
who tours around the world!!

96
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:40,737
His family owns a lot
of land in Okayama.

97
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,670
- R-Really?
- Yes!

98
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:47,040
Completely different from a
grade school teacher, huh?

99
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,840
I don't want to hear
that from you!!

100
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,039
Arranged marriage, huh...

101
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:52,139
Give it your best, Kiyone!
Okay?

102
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:54,810
A prospect like this
hardly ever comes along!

103
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:57,548
I'll give you my
full-fledged support!!

104
00:05:58,022 --> 00:05:59,614
I don't need any support.

105
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,089
How come?

106
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:03,252
I haven't made up my mind
to have an arranged marriage...

107
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:07,320
Oh! Then you'll never be
able to get married!

108
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,689
Keep your nose out of it!!

109
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,436
Umi no Hoshi
Elementary School

110
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:17,640
- Miss Kiyone!!
- Huh?

111
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:21,870
Are you really going to have
an arranged marriage?!

112
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,413
What?!

113
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,043
Congratulations, Miss Kiyone.

114
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:28,642
H-How did you know that?

115
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,243
Oh, everybody knows!!

116
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:34,021
And so, she got a call
from her mom.

117
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,025
Kiyone's gonna meet someone...

118
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,221
...for arranged marriage, Principal!

119
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:42,562
I see. Then we'll have to think
about a replacement for Miss Kiyone.

120
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,633
No! No! No!

121
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:48,805
NO!!

122
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,799
Mihoshi! YOU IDIOT!!

123
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,812
Figures. With the meeting near
at hand, she's full of energy.

124
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:57,611
Yes!

125
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,550
- And so, our country of Japan...
- No way!

126
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,285
-...is 5 + 6 x 2 to the perpendicular...
- You're kidding!

127
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,121
Miss Kiyone!
This is language class!

128
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,493
Yes, right.
So agriculture, fishing, and...

129
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:11,960
Miss Kiyone...!

130
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,631
These are what Beethoven composed...

131
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,327
She seems really agitated.

132
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,665
How come? She's gonna have
an arranged marriage, right?

133
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:22,797
Maybe she thinks this'll
be her last chance.

134
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:26,240
Poor Kiyone, full of
anticipation and insecurities...

135
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,778
I didn't know arranged marriage
was that tough!

136
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,848
What are you guys doing?!
We're supposed to be in class!!

137
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,816
Pretty Sammy, do
everything in your power...

138
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:40,448
...to help Miss Kiyone become happy.

139
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:43,720
She's plotting to restore
the balance by aiding love?!

140
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,625
I won't let that happen!

141
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,559
What is it, Sis?

142
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,766
Operation Zero is underway!

143
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:50,698
What's that?

144
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:53,328
Forget it, just get
Operation Zero going!

145
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:55,304
Yeah, but tell me what
it's about!

146
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,238
YOU THINK IT UP!!

147
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:03,469
Who would have known that
Kiyone was that worried...

148
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:06,280
We'll all do whatever
we can to help out!

149
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,649
I agree! Miss Kiyone's
so snappy, anyway!

150
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,779
It'll be way better
without her around!

151
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:15,314
Haida! That's the kind of thing
you should say quietly!

152
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,352
What do you think, Misao?

153
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:21,831
I think we should support her,
if she really wants to get married.

154
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,231
- Then it's settled!
- Wait a minute...

155
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:27,897
I don't know where she's
going to be meeting him.

156
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:30,433
What's this?

157
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:32,376
Hey you guys, take a look.

158
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,900
This is the hotel where
Miss Kiyone will meet him.

159
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,610
Where could this have fallen from?

160
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:38,882
Make sure you help out, okay?

161
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:43,083
You kind-hearted students.
I feel the same.

162
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:47,051
Yeah? Miss Kiyone's gonna meet
someone for arranged marriage?

163
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:48,916
It's the beginning of a
beautiful relationship.

164
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:51,757
And we've decided we're
going to help, too!

165
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:54,957
What a good intention!
Okay! I'll pitch in, as well!

166
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,329
Thanks, Dad!

167
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,231
Good for you, Ginji!
That's wonderful!

168
00:08:58,302 --> 00:08:59,860
It's the natural thing to do,
as a father!

169
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:01,404
Uh-huh! Wonderful!

170
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:04,441
Hey, how did you meet,
Mom and Dad?

171
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:05,770
Huh?

172
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:10,712
Well, uh... I was a student, and
your dad was an upper-classman.

173
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:13,317
And that's uh, how we met...

174
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,908
Dad...?

175
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:19,080
Anyway, Sasami, I met your dad...

176
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:20,719
...and this happened!

177
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,883
And this!

178
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,586
And this, too!

179
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:25,751
And then we got married.

180
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,991
I don't really get it,
but, wow!

181
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,833
We're meeting tomorrow...

182
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,840
Not bad...

183
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,311
Kiyone...

184
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,349
Will you marry me?

185
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:48,818
Yes!

186
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:57,988
Yeah, as if...

187
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,496
You're going to wear
that suit again, huh?

188
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,957
You wore that to the entrance
ceremony in university...

189
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:06,992
...at graduation, and when you
were looking for work, too.

190
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:09,596
You sure like that suit,
don't you?

191
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,109
It's the only one I've got!!

192
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,519
Come on, Kiyone!

193
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,218
You'll be late unless you hurry up!

194
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,481
Aah! How come you're
tagging along, anyway?!

195
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:32,992
And what the heck's with that outfit?!
You're primped up more than me!

196
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:36,191
I'm just worried about you
being on your own.

197
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,195
I should be more worried about
your coming along with me!!

198
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:43,833
If you really care about my
happiness, then don't tag along!

199
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:45,870
Kiyone...

200
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,911
Don't tag along!!

201
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,382
Good luck, Kiyone!

202
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,942
'Cause this is your very,
very last chance!

203
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,612
Butt out!!

204
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:04,261
Here it is...

205
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:07,897
Are you Kiyone?

206
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:09,364
Y-Yes...

207
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,901
Let's not bother to go
through with this.

208
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:21,244
I'm gonna go home...

209
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,546
I tripped on a rock!
How awful!

210
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,912
Ouch!!

211
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,247
- Welcome!
- Huh?

212
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,259
I have a vague feeling there
was a plot to get me here...

213
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,164
Hm?

214
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,033
Hm?

215
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,603
Hm?

216
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:51,570
It seems familiar.
This all seems very familiar.

217
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,167
Hello. Your order?

218
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,440
Uh, I'll have a coffee.

219
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,506
Coming up.

220
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,079
I feel it. I distinctly
sense something mysterious.

221
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:06,122
Huh? What is it? A black out?

222
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,788
M-Mr. Toyokawa.

223
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:18,258
You must be Kiyone Amayuri.

224
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,468
Y-Yes!

225
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,373
No, he doesn't like me...?

226
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,974
It's a pleasure.
I'm Andou Toyokawa!

227
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:30,146
What?!

228
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:32,682
Kiyone! Kiyone! Kiyone!

229
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:38,449
Kiyone. You're just
as I imagined you.

230
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,083
Oh...

231
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:42,125
You've suffered, haven't you...

232
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:43,790
Yes...

233
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:45,624
- Wonderful!
- Nice guy!

234
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,994
- Do it!
- Perfect!
- Wow!

235
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:50,226
- Stupid!
- Yeah, maybe.
- Totally stupid!

236
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:54,229
Is that guy a Love-love Monster?

237
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:57,069
No, I think he's
just a regular guy.

238
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,341
Is that right? I worked in
the school cafeteria too...

239
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,381
...before I became well known.

240
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,941
I may not look it, but I've
had my share of suffering.

241
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:12,849
Oh, is that right? I've
had nothing but troubles...

242
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:15,281
What are your hobbies, Kiyone?

243
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,951
Um, reading.

244
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,518
Oh, I like reading books, too.

245
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,327
Especially encyclopedias.
I read them every day.

246
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,566
My, you certainly like to study.

247
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,533
We've got a lot in common,
don't we.

248
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,233
Yes, we do.

249
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:33,743
He seems so nice.
In that case, maybe...

250
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,350
This is cupid,
the cherub of love, Kiyone.

251
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,143
Y-yes...

252
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:45,120
Being able to see something
as unusual as this...

253
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:46,747
...it feels like destiny.

254
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:48,587
- Wonderful!
- Cute!

255
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:51,059
- Go for it!
- Perfect!
- Wow!

256
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,358
- Stupid!
- Totally stupid!
- TOTALLY stupid!

257
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:57,230
Something's definitely
strange about that guy!

258
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,496
Uh, I agree with you.

259
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:02,434
- Kiyone...
- Y-Yes...

260
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,500
This is it. He's gonna propose.

261
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,105
W-Who are you?!

262
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:09,804
Huh?

263
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,371
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:17,049
Let's wrap up this lovey-dovey
talk right about here.

265
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:17,780
All right?

266
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,981
Pixy Misa...!

267
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,088
Get off of here! How rude!

268
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,720
I don't wanna hear that from the
enemy of all the world's girls.

269
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,027
What's that supposed to mean?

270
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:30,066
Over there...!

271
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,734
I... I don't know her!

272
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,773
Oh? There's another one.

273
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,240
And there! And here!

274
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:41,607
And over here, too.

275
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:49,945
Honestly, how many women have
you made cry, you womanizer...?

276
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:53,356
I've told you! I don't know them!
I don't! I don't!

277
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,392
You're too stubborn to admit it!

278
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:57,293
In that case...

279
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:01,629
Calling Mystics!

280
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:07,534
Shattered

281
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:13,877
You're awful!!
Love-love Monster, Break-Up Girl

282
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:17,270
W-What's this monster?!!

283
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:20,441
You're awful!
You told me you loved me!!

284
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:22,485
I don't know what
you're talking about!

285
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,384
Begone!

286
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,889
Magical Barrier!!

287
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,392
Oh! My super-cool rainbow...!

288
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:34,192
How could you do this to me
when you had my heart...?

289
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,703
This is nothing to laugh at!
Transform into Sammy!

290
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:43,805
But I'm not really sure I want
to get involved in that...

291
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,671
Forget that, just do it!

292
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,480
Pretty Mutation...

293
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,911
...Magical Recall!

294
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,594
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

295
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:15,535
Give me back all the time
I gave to you!!

296
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,206
You're acting the part,
Break-Up Girl!

297
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,368
Stop right there!

298
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:22,639
Sammy will help you with
love and arranged marriage!

299
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,772
The would-be matchmaker
has arrived!

300
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,246
Finally arrived, huh, Sammy?

301
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:30,081
Misa! Send that monster back home!

302
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,254
No, no! You wish!

303
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:35,723
Nobody can put a stop
to that breakup!

304
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,761
Then I'll have to use force!

305
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:42,265
Magical Barrier!!

306
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:45,426
Ow!

307
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:46,969
Incredible magical power!

308
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:50,434
Fantastic! Keep it up,
Break-Up Girl!

309
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:53,408
Oh, my. Sammy's in real trouble.

310
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,347
Good luck, Sammy.

311
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,349
That Tsunami...
she's so relaxed!

312
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,386
But today will be
the end of Sammy!

313
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,318
Aah! What'll I do?!

314
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,823
Go for it, Sammy!

315
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,291
Don't give up! Have guts!

316
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,056
Go and crush that freak!

317
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,628
Sure, easy for you to say...

318
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,132
- Leave it to me!
- Huh?

319
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,603
Count on me when you're
in trouble, Sammy!

320
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,737
I'm Sasami's dad. Ginji Kawai!

321
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,400
I'll come, even if
you don't call!

322
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:28,444
Cool, Ginji!

323
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:30,937
All right, let go of that man.

324
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:33,475
Oh, what a nice man!

325
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,415
What are you doing,
Break-Up Girl?!

326
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,419
Use your barrier
and pulverize him!

327
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:41,116
Yes, Mistress Misa!
Magical Barrier!

328
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,451
Stop these fruitless antics.

329
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:46,496
Won't you seek a wonderful
future with me, lady?

330
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:49,898
Oh, what a heart-wrenching line!

331
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,060
Perhaps I will...!

332
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,005
Oh, Ginji!

333
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,267
Hey...

334
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,468
Ooh! You're making me
jealous, here!!

335
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,376
- Ginji!!
- Honoka...!

336
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:05,480
GINJI, YOU JERK!!!

337
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,388
Ooh...

338
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,889
She'd conquer the world.

339
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,390
Now, Sammy!

340
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:16,983
W-What do you mean, "Now"...?

341
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:20,456
Might be a bit awkward between
them, but now's your chance!

342
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,656
Uh, yeah...

343
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,701
Converge, magic powers of justice!

344
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:31,533
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

345
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:38,510
How could you-u!!!

346
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:42,181
- You did it!
- Way to go, Sammy!

347
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,282
Count on me! Right?

348
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:45,218
- Ginji!
- Huh?

349
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:48,414
Oh, Honoka. What a
great punch that was!

350
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:49,891
You taught me that one.

351
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,595
Just like my mom and dad...

352
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:55,496
Kiyone! Hang in there, Kiyone!

353
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,897
Kiyone...!

354
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:59,458
You came to...

355
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,902
Mihoshi. Where's Mr. Toyokawa?

356
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:05,272
Oh, right. I wonder
what happened...?

357
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:06,366
- Sammy!
- Huh?

358
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,744
Oh, you're the one I've been
looking for, Pretty Sammy!

359
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:12,213
It's Miss Kiyone you're
supposed to be with, remember?

360
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:15,650
I can't believe I've met
a woman as wonderful as you!

361
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,511
Marry me, Sammy!

362
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:20,954
But I'm still just a kid!

363
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:22,514
Age doesn't matter,
if it's love!

364
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,560
It matters quite a bit.

365
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,724
Kiyone...!

366
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:31,131
Cupid... my cupid of love...!

367
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,503
Oh! Wait!

368
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:41,738
How heartbreaking, Kiyone!
It's inexcusable!

369
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:44,444
So, like I said,
I'm just not ready to...

370
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:46,004
Huh? Miss Mihoshi...

371
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,950
You can't go trampling all over
a maiden's heart like that!!

372
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:51,988
YOU IDIOT!!!

373
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:54,881
Sammy...!!

374
00:19:57,127 --> 00:20:01,120
I knew Sammy could do it.
Hey, Ramia?

375
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,426
Huh?

376
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:03,864
Absurd!!

377
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:07,495
Why was the balance restored
when she was rejected?!!

378
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,502
Should I put up with this?!

379
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,303
What the hell's going on, here?!

380
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,267
Kiyone...

381
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,512
I'm so sorry about
what happened today.

382
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,481
I did something uncalled for...

383
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:21,244
-Just forget it.
- Kiyone!

384
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:24,378
I think I was rushing things.

385
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:28,515
Marriage is a lifetime commitment,
so I need to give it a lot more thought.

386
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:32,556
One day, the man I was
destined to meet will...

387
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:33,857
- Here!
- Huh?

388
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:37,029
The principal told me about him.

389
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,193
There won't be any problems
with this guy.

390
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:41,660
And you can count on me,
for all my support!

391
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,439
NO!!!

392
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:46,635
No! No! No! No! No!

393
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,202
What's the matter?
See what a catch he is?

394
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,616
I've had my fill of
arranged marriage!!

395
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:07,925
Anata ga mitsumeteru
watashi wa kyou mo...

396
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:13,258
...hontou no watashi janai.

397
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:19,131
Kono koi no tame ni...

398
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:22,645
...anata no tame ni...

399
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,141
... tsukuriageta onna na no yo.

400
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:37,220
Shoujiki na tokoro ga iito...

401
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:42,657
...anata iu keredo.

402
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,996
Sore wa maboroshi.

403
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:50,103
Taburakasu no ga ikikata yo.

404
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:53,136
Onna no roman yo.

405
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,502
Dareyori mo suki dakara.

406
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:01,484
Iiyume misete agetakunaru.

407
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:04,782
Anata ga tottemo suki dakara.

408
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:07,680
Damashi tsuzukeru wa.

409
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:12,684
Sekaijuu no dareyori...

410
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:19,224
...shiawase na otoko ni shiteageru.

411
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:29,668
The boss! A mysterious man
controls the school.

412
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:32,579
He's a strong fighter, values relationships,
and he has a soft spot for women!

413
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:35,550
He's always wearing his school
uniform, and wooden sandals!

414
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:38,580
Coming next:
The Fellow Called Boss.

415
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:40,782
It's important for men to have
a strong fighting spirit!
