1
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:14,048
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:16,915
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:20,379
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,449
...tsukai you!

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,692
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,035
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,506
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

8
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,340
...demae ni yatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,415
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:50,043
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,188
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,951
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,761
...genki ni nareruwa.

14
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,332
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

15
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:07,096
Fushigi na chikara ga.

16
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,835
Yume mireba yume mo...

17
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,299
...yume janai.

18
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:52,941
Sasami.

19
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:55,847
That's the song called,
"Misao," right?

20
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,283
But how come you're
practicing until so late?

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,384
I'm gonna play this song
for my dad.

22
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,848
Huh? You mean...

23
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:05,950
Misao!

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,918
My dad's coming back
this Saturday!

25
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,801
Wow! How exciting for you, Misao!

26
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,701
Thanks, Sasami!

27
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,270
Misao, you really love your
dad a lot, don't you!

28
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,810
Yeah, he's the greatest!

29
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,980
Misao... Misao...

30
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,780
I love your happy, smiling face!

31
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:40,751
The Magic Fades Away

32
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,792
So, her dad's coming home!

33
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,838
That's good news, Misao.

34
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:52,964
Rumiya!

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,838
Uh, yeah?
What is it, Sis?

36
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,775
What do you mean, "what"?!

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,810
What're you doing? Finished
your plan to beat Sammy up?

38
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,546
Not yet...

39
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,583
You're so easy going,
I don't believe you!!

40
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:13,950
But Sammy was too much for
the Lovely Madams and Hikari.

41
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,461
Let's just give up.

42
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,860
No chance!!

43
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,922
But...

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,869
But Misao's dad's coming home
soon, she said. She's so happy...

45
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,338
Let's leave her alone, already.

46
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,708
Hm... I see.

47
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,875
If you keep thinking
of someone as a kid...

48
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,882
...one day, before you know it,
they're becoming an adult.

49
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,417
Right, Rumiya?

50
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,453
That's not it.

51
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,447
Okay, fine with me.

52
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,650
This'll be the last time we get
her to transform into Misa.

53
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,953
- Really?!
- However!

54
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,994
We're gonna pump Misa's
magical power up to the max.

55
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,999
This time she's gonna squash
Sammy for sure! Got it?

56
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,898
Yeah, got it.

57
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,870
If it doesn't work this time,
Juraihelm's balance will...

58
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,448
Oh, my! It's almost parallel.

59
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,084
La-di-da-di-da...

60
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,385
Just you watch, Tsunami!!

61
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:19,249
So, our class is the only
one that still hasn't decided...

62
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,261
...what to do for the
school festival in 2 weeks.

63
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,921
I know! I know! I know!

64
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,659
Yes, Haida?

65
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,826
I think we should put on a play!

66
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:29,335
I'll be the princess...

67
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,928
...and Hiroto will be the prince,
in a really romantic love story!

68
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:32,938
Overruled!!

69
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,998
Hm, a play, huh?

70
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,874
But we don't have enough
time to practice, though.

71
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,538
Any other ideas?

72
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,910
Here!

73
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,949
I know, I know!
Pick me! Pick me!

74
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,486
Excuse me!

75
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,387
We're trying to decide what
to do for the school festival.

76
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,357
Not a performing arts festival!

77
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,017
I know! How about the
"Dance of the Dead?"

78
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,153
It's not a town festival, either!

79
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,291
Hey, what do you think
we should do, Misao?

80
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,191
It'd be good to do
something all together.

81
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,136
Come on, you guys!
Think of something good!

82
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,499
Okay, let's decide on
Monday morning, in homeroom.

83
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,069
Everybody think hard, now.

84
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,282
And that's it for today.

85
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,051
Stand up!
"Today's Topic: What to do
for the school festival."


86
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,781
Good-bye, Teacher!

87
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,781
See ya!

88
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,582
Kenji! Let's hurry and drop our bags
off at home, then play soccer!

89
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,962
Today we'll really squash
those guys in Division 2!

90
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,760
Raring to go, as usual.
Huh, Hiroto?

91
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,996
Sure am! It's my only strength!

92
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,698
Oh, Hiroto!

93
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,737
Mom rented a video yesterday.
Wanna come over and watch?

94
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,802
It's such a romantic love story!!

95
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,704
Knock it off, idiot!

96
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,614
I like soccer way better!
Let me go!

97
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,015
See you guys!

98
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,145
Bye, Kawai! Bye, Amano!

99
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,916
Bye!

100
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,184
Amano sure is cheery today...

101
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,990
Yeah? You're sure
looking at her a lot.

102
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,030
Don't be stupid! I am not!!

103
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,295
Oh, Hiroto! Don't look at
anyone else but me!!

104
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,835
Let me go!!

105
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,799
So, what time does your
dad's flight arrive?

106
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,235
Um, I'm not exactly sure,
but any time now, I think.

107
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,048
Yes, right. Okay.

108
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,011
Oh!

109
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:26,779
Oh...

110
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,379
- Mom!
- Hello, Misao.

111
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,558
- Hello, Mrs. Amano.
- Hello.

112
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,652
Mom, have you heard
anything from Dad?

113
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:39,955
I just got a call.
He's at the airport.

114
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:43,595
Really?! Then he'll be
back before dinner?!

115
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,504
Honestly, coming back
so suddenly like this.

116
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,473
Thanks to him, I had to
take time off work.

117
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,009
Really, he's always so selfish!

118
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,910
Looks like we're having
a feast tonight, Mom!

119
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,979
Think so...?

120
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,847
I forgot to buy roses!

121
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,492
Oh, no. What'll I do?
Your dad loves roses.

122
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,062
I'll get them!

123
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,025
You go home and start getting
the big dinner ready.

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,091
Okay? That'll work, right?

125
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,262
All right. Then, here.

126
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:22,006
- Get as many as this will buy.
- Mm-hm! Okay! Red, right?
- That's right.

127
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,574
I've gotta run.

128
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,612
- Okay!
- See ya!

129
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,943
- Leave your bag with me!
- All right!

130
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,839
Bye!

131
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,684
You must be so happy,
Mrs. Amano!

132
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:35,248
Thanks.

133
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,119
I'll give you a ride
home, Sasami.

134
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,159
Thanks a lot!

135
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,733
Here you are.

136
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,791
Thanks!

137
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,764
Thank you!

138
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,613
Hey, guess what? My
dad's coming home today!

139
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,612
Wonder what I should say
first when I see him?

140
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,387
I can't wait to see my dad.

141
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,925
I can't wait.

142
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,590
Then...

143
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,654
Then Mom and Dad and I...

144
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,903
W-What...?

145
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,941
This feeling... my head...

146
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,935
My head...

147
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm sorry, Misao. But...

148
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,182
...this is the last time!

149
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,918
When this is over, you can
return to being a normal girl.

150
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,261
A normal girl,
living with your dad.

151
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,303
It's been two weeks since
I've done this mutation!

152
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:06,836
Magical Girl Pixy Misa's
super debut!

153
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:10,206
Misa, this is the final battle!

154
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:14,186
Use the most power you can muster up,
and create chaos in this world!

155
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,551
"Final battle...?" You've
caught me off guard a bit.

156
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:22,060
But THIS time I'll really
make Sammy bawl!

157
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,929
And now, the final showdown!

158
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,969
After today, I'll have
no reason to see Misao.

159
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,397
Those flowers are...

160
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:36,443
Here goes! This is Misa's
next-generation magic!

161
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:41,941
Calling Lovely Mystics!

162
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,189
A toast, to Misao's happiness!

163
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,529
Cheers!

164
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,268
"The taste that cuts
straight to the bone!"

165
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,969
Oh, Sasami! Where did you
pick up such a thing!

166
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,331
What're you talking about?
It's just juice!

167
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,276
Sure is great about Misao.
That her dad's come home.

168
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:19,248
Yeah! Misao and her mom
sure looked happy!

169
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:25,456
What'd you do if your dad had
to go away for a long time?

170
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:28,495
Huh? Well, I've never really
thought about it before.

171
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,962
But I guess if that happened...

172
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,127
...I'd probably cry!

173
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,192
Don't worry, Sasami. We're
just talking, "what if"?

174
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,867
Think I'd actually go overseas...

175
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,840
...and leave behind a cute girl
like you, and a beautiful wife?!

176
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,139
- Right, Honoka?
- Right, Ginji!

177
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,037
- Honoka!
- That's the truth!

178
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,740
Oh, brother...

179
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,081
Oh, Ryo-Ohki.

180
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,985
Sasami. There's trouble!

181
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,329
The NT gauge is responding.

182
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,762
Look, Sasami!

183
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,800
Whoah! What's that?!

184
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,458
Oh, my God!!

185
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,674
A Hyper Love-love Monster!

186
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,845
It's a Love-love Monster!

187
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,891
Never seen one THAT big before!

188
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,926
I'm sensing unbelievable
power from that pollen!

189
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:41,990
What?

190
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,037
Don't breathe it in!

191
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,962
Right!

192
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,875
I can't let the air get inside.

193
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:53,935
Oh, yeah. Right.

194
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,413
How am I supposed to
eat this crap?!

195
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:05,121
Never wanted you to eat
my cooking, anyway!

196
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,453
Dad! Mom!

197
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,358
I hate your guts, Honoka!

198
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,454
I really, really hate
your guts too, Ginji!

199
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:12,999
Let's hurry and get a divorce!

200
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:13,998
Let's!

201
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,466
Dad! Mom!

202
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:16,525
Oh!

203
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,969
Lousy kid, who only gets
60% on her tests!

204
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,633
Exactly! Let's get rid of her!

205
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,810
Hey, Dad! Mom! What are
you talking about?!

206
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,613
- Ryo-Ohki, is this...
- Mm-hm!

207
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,573
The pollen's causing this!

208
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,551
If this keeps up, the whole
world is gonna turn hateful!

209
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,011
Kenji! Suddenly I can't
stand the sight of you!

210
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,414
What a coincidence!
The feeling's mutual!

211
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,924
Ohhh!

212
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,961
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate your guts, Hiroto!

213
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,862
- We aren't father and son anymore!
- Suits me fine!

214
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,900
- Come out, you fool!
- Shut up!!

215
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,363
This is terrible! Dad... Mom...

216
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,996
Everybody's got to go
back to normal!

217
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,506
Pretty Mutation...

218
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,638
...Magical Recall!

219
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,959
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

220
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,359
From Yokohama:
45 km. Traffic Jam

221
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,471
What's going on? This is
unusual; a traffic jam.

222
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,604
Oh, hi officer. Has
something happened?

223
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,108
You can't go this way.

224
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,577
A giant rose has appeared in
town, and it's total chaos!

225
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,178
A giant rose?

226
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,444
Yes. People become nasty if
they breathe the pollen in.

227
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,418
Hey, wait!

228
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:45,114
Kotoe and Misao
are in that town!

229
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,887
...and the entire town is in chaos.

230
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,723
It's believed that behind it all
is the sudden appearance...

231
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:55,325
...of a gigantic rose and
the pollen from that rose.

232
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,100
What the hell's going on?!!

233
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,570
Quit lying around watching TV,
you lazy couch potatoes!

234
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,698
Oh, no!

235
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,113
Keep at it, Love-love Monster!

236
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:15,180
Fill this world with nasty people!

237
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,647
Hold it right there!

238
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,484
Count on Sammy, when it comes
to magical predicaments!

239
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,361
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!
Here to save the world!

240
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,327
You've come, you lousy pest!

241
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,534
Misa, turn the townspeople
back to normal!

242
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:35,041
No can do! And the reason is
that this is my final battle!

243
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,575
"Your final battle?!"

244
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:42,210
My reputation's on the line, and
I won't let you interfere, Sammy!

245
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,648
How can this be? According to my
data, Pixy Misa's magical power...

246
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,157
...is about 3 times
stronger than before!

247
00:14:57,164 --> 00:15:01,123
Come on, Sammy! You're the only
one who can save everybody!

248
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,973
Hey, let me go! Let me go!

249
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,940
Well, it's about time
you resigned yourself.

250
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,015
I WILL NOT!

251
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,545
I definitely won't let someone
use Misao's beloved roses...

252
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,524
...to do something bad!!

253
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,962
Okay, this is the end!
Say your prayers!

254
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,466
MISAO!!

255
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,843
What was that...?

256
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,306
Misao... Kotoe...!

257
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,718
He's calling for Misao...

258
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,347
Oh, he must be Misao's dad!

259
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,354
Misao! Misao!!

260
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,287
This is terrible! If the
two of them meet now...!

261
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,399
I'm loosening it!

262
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,710
Pretty...!

263
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,370
Go for it, Sammy!
Hurry! Hurry!

264
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,741
Hurry! Hurry and finish
Sammy off! And then...

265
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,209
...everything will return to normal!

266
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,758
Pixy Lovely Fire!

267
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,701
Hurry! Hurry and be gone!

268
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,062
MISAO!!

269
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,557
Uh-oh...

270
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,766
Dad... Mom...

271
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,598
Kotoe...

272
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,811
Honey...

273
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,908
- Kotoe!
- Honey!

274
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,682
Did it!

275
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,675
It's the power of love!!

276
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,887
Do it, Sammy!
Do it, Sammy!

277
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,620
Knock her down, for sure,
for sure, for sure!

278
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,951
Because I... because Sasami...

279
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,762
...loves Misao's happy face!

280
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:49,425
Pretty...Coquettish... Bomber!!

281
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:05,542
I can't wait to see my dad.
I can't wait.

282
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,779
Then Dad, Mom and I...

283
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,626
Incredible!

284
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,872
This is for the best.

285
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,443
Roses can't be used
to make people unhappy.

286
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,572
Because... because roses...

287
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,647
...roses are Dad's favorite flowers.

288
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,140
This is Pixy Misa's baton.

289
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,678
Did I have this baton...?

290
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:14,615
Then... I am...

291
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,080
...Pixy Misa...?!

292
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,519
Misao...?

293
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,590
Misao?

294
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,833
What are you doing here?

295
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,261
That baton!

296
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,670
It can't be!

297
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,468
What?!!

298
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,906
Jesus!!

299
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,545
No way... it can't be...

300
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,022
Misao...

301
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,820
Misao, you're Pixy Misa...?!

302
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,624
How... how could it be...?

303
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,092
Sasami...

304
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,606
So all along, I've been
doing this to you, Sasami?

305
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,009
It's not true, is it, Misao?

306
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,040
You're not really Misa...

307
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,344
...right?

308
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,618
NOOO!!

309
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,537
Misao... Misao...

310
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,338
Misao...

311
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,070
She's gone!

312
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,085
Misao...

313
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,273
Imasara ieta girijanai keredo...

314
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:25,611
...watashi wa warukattawa.

315
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:33,858

...choushini notte orimashita.

317
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,828
Mayonakano juuni-jiwa,

00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:51,502
...Cinderella dake janai.

...choushini notte orimashita.

324
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,939
There's someone important to me.

325
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,141
Someone dear to me,
who I can't lose.

326
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,116
When she smiles, she
makes me happy.

327
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,983
When she cries, she makes
me wanna start crying, too.

328
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,885
I'm not lying, Misao!

329
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:40,385
Coming next: Friends.
