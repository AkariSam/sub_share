1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,581
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,414
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,947
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,956
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,192
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,534
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,005
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,839
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,881
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,509
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,687
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,450
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,261
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,864
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,628
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,334
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,798
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,124
Be quiet and listen, everyone!!

19
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,555
School Festival

20
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,898
I know I've told you this,
but our class is the only one...

21
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,199
...that hasn't decided what
to do for the school festival!

22
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,829
I know! I know! I know!

23
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,100
Yes, Haida?

24
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,165
I think we should put on a play!

25
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,801
I agree!

26
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,544
I'll be the princess, and
Hiroto will be the prince...

27
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,548
...in a really romantic
love story!

28
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,516
Overruled!!

29
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,782
Oh, brother! You still
don't like my idea!!

30
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,618
Now, now, Konoha.

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,056
There's not much time
until the school festival.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,152
Let's do a simple chorus number.

33
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,493
Gee, you call yourself a teacher?!

34
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,628
That's right!

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,158
Come on you guys, you want
to decide, just like that?

36
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,705
Let's do a chorus number!

37
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,700
I disagree! I disagree!
I disagree! I disagree!

38
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,445
I'd like to do
a chorus number, Haida...

39
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,447
I vote for the chorus idea!

40
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,110
Get back to your seat!

41
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,620
It's one thing to decide
on a simple chorus...

42
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,349
...but what'll we do
about music?

43
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,584
Yes, right.

44
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,127
Is there anyone who'd
like to give it a try?

45
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,759
Um...

46
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,200
Huh?

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,728
Um, could I play the piano?

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,637
Amano's offering to do it!

49
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,141
- Wow!
- No way!

50
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,075
Misao...

51
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,115
I'll play the piano!

52
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:10,011
I'm Glad to Have the Mystic Force

53
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,612
Misao's dad composed that piece!

54
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,743
- It's called, "Misao". Right?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,087
What a beautiful song!

56
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,521
It's perfect for my singing voice!

57
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,616
I don't wanna admit it,
but she's good.

58
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,924
If we write some lyrics for the
song, we can sing it together.

59
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,897
Great idea! We'll rock!
Right, Teacher?

60
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,693
My students have agreed to work
together to accomplish something!

61
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,364
This is what education's
all about, right, Principal?

62
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,201
Seems we got the okay to do it.

63
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,268
That's what we'll do
for the school festival!

64
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,779
But...

65
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,779
This piece hasn't been finished.

66
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,148
So I don't think it'll work
as a performance.

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,721
Hm? Amano, the whole
piece is right here.

68
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,195
What?

69
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,129
- I want to see Dad.
- I want to see you, too.

70
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,821
Dad! Dad finished the song!

71
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,891
He knew I was practicing,
and he finished the song!

72
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,866
That's great, Misao!

73
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,134
Yeah! I'll try my best!

74
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,872
I'll try to play this song.

75
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,613
All right! Now we just have
to work on the lyrics!

76
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,914
"Misao"

77
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,550
So seeing as how
it's Misao's song...

78
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,485
...we decided Misao's the one
who'll write the lyrics, too.

79
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,348
Thank goodness Miss Mihoshi
won't be writing the lyrics!

80
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,518
And thank goodness for
everyone's common sense!

81
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,953
- Yeah, but...
- What is it?

82
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,165
I've been thinking. Since
Misao's gonna be playing the piano...

83
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,100
...I just wish her dad could
be there to see her.

84
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,137
You're so thoughtful, Sasami.

85
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,970
All right, then! We'll try
to do something about it!

86
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,372
Really?!

87
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,639
So, where is Misao's dad, anyway?

88
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,976
Um, somewhere overseas.

89
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,310
Then we're out of luck.

90
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,178
How come?!

91
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,685
We don't have any money!

92
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,619
We're poor!!

93
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,057
I hate being poor.

94
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,191
It just can't be done, Sasami.

95
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,823
You can't go overseas
at the drop of a hat.

96
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,335
Yeah, you're right. I can't
just go at the drop of a...

97
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,836
What is it?

98
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,130
Ryo-Ohki!!

99
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,069
Ryo-Ohki! Ryo-Ohki!
You've gotta help me!

100
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,042
Show me some kind of magic
to send me instantly overseas!

101
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,582
You can't just ask me something
like that, out of the blue!

102
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,377
It doesn't exist?

103
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,285
It's not as if instantaneous
teleport magic doesn't exist...

104
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,983
...but it's difficult, and the
exact place has to be specified.

105
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,282
So I just have to find out
the exact place!

106
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,055
That's all!

107
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:07,396
Professor Washu! Um,
I have a favor to ask you...

108
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,399
Huh?

109
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,699
I want you to figure out
where Misao's dad is!

110
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,907
Oh, what a shame, Sasami.

111
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,171
Today, only favors for Sammy
are on the house.

112
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,872
So, I'll only take favors
from Sammy.

113
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,916
Please do me a favor!

114
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,956
Okay!

115
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,327
Hi, Professor Washu.

116
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,990
How'd you make out, James?

117
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,897
Thanks to a report from our agent...

118
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,870
... we know that Shigeki Amano
is in Venezuela, South America.

119
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,802
We don't know precisely
where he is, though.

120
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,169
Thanks. That's a big help.

121
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,839
No need to thank me.
Your smile's thanks enough.

122
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,541
Oh, James!

123
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,584
Adieu!

124
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,650
Got it, Sammy? If you
leave things up to me...

125
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,488
...I can get all this information
in the blink of an eye!

126
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,223
Oh, what an impatient girl.

127
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,027
Sammy, instantaneous teleport
magic is so difficult...

128
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,296
...that even Tsunami
is unable to use it.

129
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,562
I still wanna try it!

130
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,266
Okay.

131
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,102
Then concentrate hard
on the baton.

132
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,045
Imagine the place
you want to go...

133
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,411
...and imagine yourself
flying through the sky.

134
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,908
Then hold up the baton and
call out, "Pretty Teleport"!

135
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,876
Okay!

136
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,014
I'm gonna fly to Venezuela!

137
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,722
Pretty Teleport!

138
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,124
We've been teleported!
Ryo-Ohki, we're flying!!

139
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,099
Well, we're definitely
flying in the sky.

140
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,536
But I get the feeling we're
not nearly far enough!

141
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,646
- Isn't that the magical girl?
- It's Sammy!

142
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,453
Wonder why she's all wet?

143
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,456
You look absolutely terrible.

144
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,458
Don't say that, Ryo-Ohki.

145
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,962
It's still too hard for you
to use Pretty Teleport.

146
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,064
I'll do it, even if it IS hard!

147
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,894
I'll try it again,
as soon as we get back!

148
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,464
Are you serious?!

149
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,062
I'm totally serious!
I'm completely, totally serious!

150
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,704
Music Room

151
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,313
Aren't we happy?

152
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,117
Even beautiful scenery...
Even a beautiful flower...
"The Wings of My Heart"

153
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,855
Pretty Teleport!

154
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,993
Even beautiful scenery...

155
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,139
Even a beautiful flower...

156
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,208
Announcing the School Festival!

157
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,755
One! Two!

158
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,574
Go for it, Sammy!

159
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,052
My 43rd sincere try at
Pretty Teleport!

160
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,956
Why are we coming up
from a place like this?

161
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,484
It's my 43rd try, but I'm
not getting any better at all!

162
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,498
And I stink. This is the worst!

163
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,999
Sammy! Look out! Look out!

164
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,670
I can't take this...!

165
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,434
What was that?

166
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,136
What'll I do? The school festival
is starting in three days.

167
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,647
You should probably give up
on the Pretty Teleport idea.

168
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,510
But Misao's been working
so hard for this!

169
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,085
I wanna fix it so that somehow
she can see her dad!

170
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,491
If only there were some other way...

171
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,651
I know!!

172
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,959
- A letter, Sasami!
- "A letter"?

173
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,556
Yeah! Write a letter, and
use your magic to send it!

174
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,795
You should be able to send
something as light as a letter!

175
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,704
You're right! I can
probably do that!

176
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,140
Thanks, Ryo-Ohki!

177
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,475
I'll give it my best shot!

178
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,010
Wow...

179
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,585
"To Misao's Father.
How do you do."

180
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:59,051
"My name is Sasami Kawai,
and I'm Misao's friend."

181
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,060
"I know this is sudden, but
we have a school festival"...

182
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,097
... "coming up at our school,
on the 21st. "

183
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:10,662
"We'll all be singing, and Misao
will accompany us on the piano."

184
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:15,133
"Please come and see Misao.
She's been practicing so hard."

185
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,732
"I think she'll be
so happy if you do."

186
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,273
"I want to see her
looking happy, too."

187
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,681
"I hope you'll come."

188
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,486
"Misao's Friend,
Sasami Kawai"

189
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,817
Pretty Mutation...

190
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,819
...Magical Recall!

191
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,443
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

192
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,847
I can hear Misao
playing the piano.

193
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,690
I can feel how much
she wants to see her dad.

194
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,817
So I'm gonna try my best!

195
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,660
Put all your feelings into it!

196
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,224
Converge, magic powers of feelings!

197
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,603
Pretty Coquettish Bomber!

198
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,709
Wonder if it'll get there?

199
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,506
It'll get there, for sure.

200
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,081
Bravo!

201
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:51,937
"To Misao's Father"

202
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,905
What's this?

203
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,471
School Festival

204
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,418
- Be quiet!
- Good luck!

205
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,453
Listen, everybody!

206
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,655
Listen to me!!

207
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,125
A pumpkin! A pumpkin!
Or even a potato!

208
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,355
Miss Mihoshi! You listen, too!

209
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,396
Yes!!

210
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,093
Our big moment has almost
arrived, everyone!

211
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,498
Show your father, your mother
and even your neighbors...

212
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,539
...how hard we've been practicing!

213
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,773
Yeah, let's show 'em
what we're made of!!

214
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,469
Yeah!!

215
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,604
What's the matter, Misao?

216
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,544
I'm kinda nervous, all of a sudden.

217
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:39,243
There's nothing to worry about.
Think how much you've practiced.

218
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,684
- Uh-huh.
- You can do it, right?!

219
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,921
Yeah, I can.

220
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,184
It's almost your turn. Division 3,
please assemble in the gym.

221
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,319
Come on, everyone.

222
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,025
Show them what Grade 4,
Division 3 is really made of!!

223
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,896
By singing?!

224
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,341
Next is a chorus
by Grade 4, Division 2.

225
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,877
The song is called,
"The Wings of My Heart".

226
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,914
Looking good, Sasami!!

227
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,783
You can do it, Sasami!!

228
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,787
Yay!

229
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,754
Oh, brother!

230
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,084
Maybe she's too busy...

231
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,494
Mom!

232
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,932
Misao! When did
my little girl suddenly...

233
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,909
Misao.

234
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,159
Misao!

235
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,124
Amano...

236
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,261
Amano.

237
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,634
What's she doing?!

238
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,600
Misao...

239
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,510
You can do it, Misao!

240
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,449
Dad, I'll try my best.
For my dear mom...

241
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,486
...and my best friend.

242
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,387
Misao.

243
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,162
Even beautiful scenery...

244
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:43,438
Even a beautiful flower...

245
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:44,410
Is meaningless...

246
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,712
- Oh, what a great song!
- Beautiful!

247
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,508
Is meaningless...

248
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,146
...when you see it alone.

249
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,978
Because there's a friend who laughs...

250
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:01,516
And cries with you...

251
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:06,664
Because they are your friend...

252
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,592
That's what makes it enjoyable.

253
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,397
So, you're leaving.

254
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,928
I'm sorry. But this
is my last chance.

255
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,975
But a pianist...!

256
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,846
Mommy!

257
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,007
What's the matter?
Did you have a bad dream?

258
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,710
Uh-huh!

259
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,715
Everything's okay now.
I'm almost finished here.

260
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,081
You can go to sleep
on your own, right?

261
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,352
Uh-huh.

262
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,587
Night, Mommy.

263
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,630
My girl.

264
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,021
My little girl...

265
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,568
Sounds like she's done a lot
of practicing at home.

266
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,938
What are you doing here?!

267
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:51,301
I'm sorry. I've been such
a nuisance to you and Misao.

268
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,438
I'm a failure as a father.

269
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,243
Looking into each other's eyes...

270
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,911
We can understand one another...

271
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,617
Let's start on a journey...

272
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:12,086
...toward a rainbow.

273
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,548
Congratulations, Misao!

274
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,524
That was beautiful, children!
Well done!

275
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,888
Amano!

276
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,926
What?

277
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,019
That wasn't bad, I guess.

278
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,532
Th-Thank you.

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,763
Way to go, Misao!

280
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,462
Thanks!

281
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,637
- It arrived!
- Huh?

282
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,675
Here. Look, Misao.

283
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,741
Misao.

284
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,784
Dad...

285
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,045
No way...

286
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,518
It's for real.

287
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,225
Dad...

288
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,567
Dad!

289
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,727
Dad!!

290
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,651
You've really grown up.
I hardly recognized you.

291
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,954
My wish really came true.

292
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,585
My wish to see you came true.

293
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,687
Yes, it did come true.

294
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,558
And it's all thanks to
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.

295
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,162
What?

296
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,429
She told me about you,
in her magical letter.

297
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,493
Sammy did?

298
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,405
Sasami...

299
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,573
Dad, I've really
wanted to see you!

300
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,618
I've wanted to see you
for so long!

301
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,613
You did very well, Misao.

302
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,154
Guess what, Mom?!

303
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,350
I wanna be a pianist!
Just like Dad!

304
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,727
A really great pianist!

305
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,162
Misao...

306
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,528
I've made up my mind!
That's what I'm gonna be!

307
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,697
It's tough being
a pianist, you know.

308
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,204
You've got to study
really hard, too!

309
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,241
Yeah! I will!

310
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,870
I love you so much, Dad!
And you, too, Mom!

311
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,072
Lots and lots and lots!

312
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,844
Heaven grant you happiness, Misao.

313
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,682
Isn't that great, Sasami?

314
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,785
Yeah! And it's all owing
to you and my magic!

315
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,593
No, you were able to do it
because of your feelings for Misao.

316
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,566
Sasami, magic is really
a make-believe technique.

317
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,604
If you want to become a pianist,
and you use magic to transform...

318
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,337
...after a time, the magic
would wear off.

319
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,711
That's really what it's like.

320
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,678
Yeah.

321
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,148
You can't use magic
to make people happy.

322
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,745
But you can use magic to help
them become a little happy.

323
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,983
I really believe that can be done.

324
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,755
I understand, Ryo-Ohki.

325
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,355
I'm happy I became
a magical girl.

326
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,261
Tsunami, from the magical
kingdom, will be happy, right?

327
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,998
Yeah, for sure!

328
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,336
I'm so glad I'm magic!

329
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,801
The balance has been
completely restored.

330
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,211
Thank you, Pretty Sammy.

331
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,187
A QUEEN IS BORN

332
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:19,871
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

333
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:26,074
...but I was wrong.

334
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:34,358
To say there are any number
of guys out there...

335
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:38,726
...I should've known better.

336
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,428
Midnight,

337
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,737
Comes to anyone,

338
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:52,071
...not only to Cinderella.

339
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:58,549
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

340
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:05,414
...but I've made light
of the whole world.

341
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:13,329
To think that somehow things
would turn out all right...

342
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:18,028
...I should've known better.

343
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,276
Misao's completely cheered up,
and I'm so, so happy!

344
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,786
But! A mysterious group of monsters
appears and destroys my school!

345
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,788
Coming Next:
The Third Magical Girl is Coming!

346
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,882
A third magical girl.
And her name is...
