1
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,073
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:17,008
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:20,346
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,440
...tsukai you!

5
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,717
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:35,060
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:39,531
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

8
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,365
...demae niyatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:47,407
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,035
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:54,180
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,943
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,787
...genki ni nareruwa.

14
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:04,357
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

15
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:07,121
Fushigi na chikara ga.

16
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:10,985
Yume mireba yume mo...

17
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:14,299
...yume janai.

18
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,008
Good morning, everyone!
Let's give our best today!

19
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:59,311
Okay!

20
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:04,582
All right, everyone's here.
Let's work out before breakfast!

21
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,481
- Yes!
- Excuse me...!

22
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,913
Peter! You're forgetting
about me!

23
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:15,151
Who's interrupting my lovely
dream of sweet-smelling hay?!

24
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:16,695
Huh?

25
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:20,228
They're increasing their leg
strength on a hilly, grassy path.

26
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,692
Very logical exercise.

27
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,933
No wonder Peter's a famous young
breeder throughout the world.

28
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,976
P-Peter...!

29
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:33,110
Hang in there, Fake Sick Girl!

30
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:35,647
This is heavy! You shouldn't
be carrying this!

31
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:38,309
It's no use. I can't make it.

32
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:41,046
When all the leaves have
fallen from that tree...

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,281
...my life will also be over.

34
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,381
- Right?
- You'll be fine!

35
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,688
It's so fresh and green
and thick!

36
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:48,727
Huh...?

37
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,659
There.

38
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,220
Oh, my head's spinning.

39
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,596
I'm right here. Be strong!

40
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,067
Thank you, Peter.
I love you.

41
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,262
Fake Sick Girl...!

42
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:02,698
Everyone's magical powers
are growing much stronger.

43
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,805
Fake Sick Girl's fake
sickness is fantastic, too.

44
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,312
Now, even if
Pretty Sammy shows up...

45
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:19,123
...it'll turn out like this ideal
simulation. This is the institute...

46
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:22,718
...to strengthen the Love-love Monsters
so they can overthrow Sammy!

47
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,530
And they call it...

48
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,467
The Island of Love-love Monsters

49
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:33,602
What's so funny...?

50
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:49,621
Sasami's gone on a trip with her father
now that it's summer vacation.

51
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:54,621
I wonder what distant friends
she'll make happy this time?

52
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:56,662
I'm looking forward to seeing this.

53
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,597
That's a little bitter.

54
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:11,039
I wonder where Ginji and
Sasami are riding, right now...

55
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,353
Oh, my!

56
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:24,622
Oh!

57
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:30,057
It must've been old.

58
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:32,524
That's terrible. It's defective.

59
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,326
Here, Hiroto.

60
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,894
Open wide.

61
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:41,630
Don't want it.

62
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,809
You're awful! You mean you
would've taken it from Amano?!

63
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,345
W-What are you saying?!

64
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,813
Stop your fighting, you two!

65
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,850
Smile, everybody!

66
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,450
Cheese!

67
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,986
Okay, one more!

68
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:58,756
Why do I have to lead them
during the summer vacation?

69
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,758
Especially when it's not my class!

70
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:04,997
Oh, come on now. The American, Stephen,
said that travel is all about companions.

71
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,726
Who's he?

72
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,323
It's okay, Kiyone.

73
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:12,735
Professor Washu has covered
all the costs for our trip.

74
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,363
Right?

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,931
I know. I understand.

76
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,239
But what I can't understand
is you!

77
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,642
What?

78
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:22,681
What's with that outfit?!

79
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:26,013
This? She said we'd be swimming!

80
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,780
Put it away!

81
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,718
You could've changed there.

82
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,257
But I wanted to wear it sooner!

83
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:33,791
How embarrassing...

84
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:35,326
Yay!

85
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:39,826
- How's this?
- Looking good, Miss Mihoshi.

86
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,628
But I think what you're doing
isn't common sense!

87
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,272
I wish I could get off now...!

88
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:49,404
Huh?

89
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,967
You look beautiful in your
casual clothes, Miss Kiyone.

90
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:55,013
What are you saying,
all of a sudden?

91
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:58,577
I think you're beautiful.

92
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,855
Try to catch me, Teacher!

93
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,549
Wait, my love!

94
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,229
Enough!

95
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,557
What is it, Kiyone?

96
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:18,967
Nothing at all.
Can I have a sip?

97
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,801
No way, it's mine.

98
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:21,999
Right.

99
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,473
Oh! Oh, my!

100
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,009
What is it?

101
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:26,401
We're getting off at the next stop.

102
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,470
What? We're not at the beach, yet.

103
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:31,675
I'm the sponsor here.
I'm the special school instructor.

104
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,912
And I'm the genius. Get it?

105
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:36,917
So quit grumbling and get off.

106
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,818
Okay, students?

107
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:40,290
Yes!

108
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,696
Ryo-Ohki?

109
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,131
Sasami. Are you awake?

110
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:56,839
Morning, Dad.

111
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,706
You had quite a sleep there, huh?

112
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:02,009
Yeah, I was really comfortable here.
So? Where are we?

113
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,343
Maybe a deserted island.

114
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:06,111
What?! Maybe?!
A deserted island?!

115
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,782
I can't be sure, so, "maybe."

116
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,049
No people are on this island,
so, "deserted island."

117
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:13,819
Oh, I see.
But that's not the point!

118
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,361
What are we doing here?
Why?! How?! Tell me!

119
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:17,863
I don't know.

120
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,989
Y-You don't know?

121
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,790
No.

122
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:23,931
All I can say is...

123
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:25,493
Yeah? Yeah?

124
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,436
You were in a deep sleep.

125
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:28,871
Yeah!

126
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,568
Ryo-Ohki was sleeping, too.

127
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:32,876
Dad was sleeping, too.

128
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,708
What?! What do you mean?

129
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,915
First this...
...then that...

130
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:39,643
-...then...
- We were here.

131
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,080
I see! It's no big deal,
now that we've figured it out.

132
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:47,125
Right? Good lesson, huh?

133
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:47,915
Yeah!

134
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:50,655
Falling asleep at the wheel
causes accidents!

135
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,655
Do they really think this
is going to be okay...?

136
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,632
Oh, yeah! If I transform into
Pretty Sammy, we can get home, right?

137
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,101
Sammy doesn't know how to
use translocation magic yet.

138
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,535
Oh.

139
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,530
Mom will be worried, huh?

140
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,509
No problem. We have an
"I love you" sign.

141
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:07,737
Honoka!

142
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,781
I love you!

143
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,586
Oh, Ginji! You devil!

144
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:14,153
I'm so stupid...

145
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:15,654
There!
I'm so stupid...

146
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:19,590
I'm so stupid...

147
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,852
I'm with you right now...

148
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,323
...but my mind is absent and empty.

149
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:27,865
Good shot!

150
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,225
Wait up, Sasami!

151
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,894
Come and get me!

152
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,268
Okay! Here!

153
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:36,064
That's cold, Dad!

154
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:39,044
- Take that! And that! And that!
- I'll get you back!

155
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,114
More! More! A little more right!

156
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:47,108
...I can hear your voice...

157
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:54,717
...but I don't know what to say to you.

158
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,095
- Dad?
- What?

159
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,098
I'm hungry.

160
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,633
Okay.

161
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:06,768
Ramia-is-evil, Ramia-is-a-devil.

162
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:10,242
Misa was right. This way's
much easier to remember.

163
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:14,211
What are you calling for, out of
the blue? Something up, Rumiya?

164
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,180
Sis, Sasami's here.

165
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:17,374
Where?

166
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,349
The Love-love Monster farm.

167
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:23,354
What's that? That Pretty Sammy!
How dare she?!

168
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:27,425
Despicable magical girl!

169
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:30,087
Rumiya! Tell Misa to
launch a counterattack!

170
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,056
Y-Yes, I know.

171
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,795
Go, go, Kiyone!

172
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:42,266
Come on, Mihoshi!
You can do it!

173
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:45,572
I get it. That's why
she invited us along.

174
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:48,704
I'm starting to resent
my low teaching salary.

175
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,683
Smile, everyone!

176
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:54,345
Wow!

177
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,388
Isn't it great, Ryo-Ohki?!

178
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,716
Who's there?

179
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:04,391
Why?! Pretty Sammy
is on this island?!

180
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:07,057
Yeah. So we have to come up
with a plan, quick.

181
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:08,963
I've got something powerful!

182
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:11,229
Love-love Monsters! Go find Sammy...

183
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:14,636
...and make sure she'll never
return to society again!

184
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:17,803
Stand up, Fake Sick Girl!

185
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,079
- What's wrong?
- I'm dizzy.

186
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,646
Don't pull that on me!

187
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:25,047
What's wrong, Misa?

188
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:28,450
Oh, sorry.
Peter's been looking after them.

189
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,818
Seems they only listen to him.

190
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:35,326
Oh, Peter. I'll die
without you here.

191
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,595
Where are you?!
Where are you, Peter?

192
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,256
"She seems healthy."

193
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,692
- Come back!
- What'll we do, Misa?

194
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,663
- What'll we do?
- What?!

195
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,612
This is delicious!

196
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,239
Thanks, uh...

197
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:01,116
My name's Heita Hirata.
But everybody calls me Peter.

198
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:01,914
And you?

199
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:04,114
I'm Sasami Kawai.
You can call me Sasami.

200
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,713
Sasami, huh.

201
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,692
Isn't this a deserted island, Peter?

202
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:13,095
Yeah. It's a small island.
Just me and some animals live here.

203
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,723
- Animals?
- Peter!

204
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,394
- Animals at the ranch where I work.
- Stop!

205
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:20,600
Could you tell us the
way off this island?

206
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:25,140
Sure thing! The opposite shore is only
2 km. away from a place I'll show you.

207
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,371
Huh? We have to swim 2 km.?!

208
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:31,780
That's right. How did you
get to this island, anyway?

209
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,086
Well, funny you should ask.

210
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,221
Huh? What's the matter, Ryo-Ohki?

211
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,316
There's a magic smell coming
from that boy, Sasami.

212
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,122
A magic smell?

213
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:46,494
No way, there's no magic here.

214
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:48,867
I know, but still...

215
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,133
The sound of rippling waves
pushing forward.

216
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:54,434
The glimmering ocean,
just for the two of us...

217
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,633
He's running along the beach.
I tackle and run into him.

218
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,642
Then I tell him.

219
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,543
"I have something simple to
say, to express my feelings."

220
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,248
"I love you."

221
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:09,981
Haida! You're putting me in
a difficult ethical position, here!

222
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:13,615
Where's Hiroto?

223
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,718
He went that way with
Professor Washu and the others.

224
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:20,458
Oh, that Hiroto! But I love
that cool part of him, too!

225
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:24,796
Where are we going,
Professor Washu?

226
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,600
- We're looking for something.
- Oh! That's...

227
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:32,670
Isn't that Kawai's dad's bike?

228
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,444
Definitely.

229
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:37,573
What's it doing here?

230
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,847
Oh, my. I guess Sasami
wanted to join us HERE.

231
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:43,820
I hate this!

232
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,915
I don't want to be in the same
profession as this woman!

233
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:50,855
Hiroto!

234
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,897
Here comes that big mouth, again!

235
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,731
Where's Peter?!

236
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,664
That's...!

237
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,328
A Love-love Monster!

238
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,232
Why do you look so excited?!

239
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,274
Just got carried away.

240
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:06,607
This isn't the time for
that, Kenji! Run for it!

241
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:08,646
Oh, well, I should go
with him. Let's go!

242
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:12,515
I'm hallucinating from this heat.
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

243
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,417
Kiyone! Kiyone!
We've got to hurry and escape!

244
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:16,419
Peter!

245
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:19,389
Say something, Kiyone!

246
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,891
Here she comes!

247
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,086
Where are you, Peter?

248
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:29,031
Sasami! Something magic
is going on here!

249
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,028
What?!

250
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,036
Definitely! A Love-love Monster!

251
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,265
Sasami, you've got to transform
into Pretty Sammy!

252
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,307
Easy for you to say!

253
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,273
What's wrong, Sasami?

254
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:40,470
Huh? Uh... um...

255
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,316
My tummy suddenly hurts.

256
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:47,852
So I'm gonna go to the bathroom!

257
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,445
- Do you have tissue?
- I'll be okay!

258
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,057
Here, Sasami!

259
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,156
Oh, I even have to be
a magical girl on my vacation...

260
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,957
Pretty Mutation...

261
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,962
...Magical Recall!

262
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:23,047
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

263
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:25,983
Just a little further!

264
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,621
Know where Peter is?

265
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,359
Monsters up ahead, too!

266
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,295
Know where Peter is?

267
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:34,992
She's heavy!

268
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,061
Sorry...!

269
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,329
More importantly...

270
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:41,270
Kiyone's passed out, it's okay.

271
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,705
I see.

272
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:46,335
At times like this, leave it to
the genius, Washu-chan!

273
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:48,038
I press this...

274
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,987
No! Our escape route's destroyed!

275
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:59,023
That's your fault!

276
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:00,358
You got me.

277
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:02,792
A little further, Sammy!

278
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,796
Meanwhile, onward ran the magical girl...

279
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,760
Where is Peter?

280
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,358
- Stop! Fake Sick Girl!
- Peter!

281
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:11,527
It's her!

282
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,503
Pixy Misa!

283
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:20,469
Excuse me? Could you pose
more like a magical girl?

284
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,276
I have to think up a pose
for my entrance...

285
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,816
Why, why, why?!

286
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:29,581
Why?! What are you people
doing here?!

287
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:32,385
Washu the genius brought
them here!

288
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:35,324
It seems that everybody
knows my plans.

289
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,659
Um, what plan are you
talking about?

290
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,325
I won't listen to you!
And please don't start bragging!

291
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,568
Okay, Love-love Monsters!

292
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:48,868
Get these lost vacationers
and force them out of here!

293
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:50,640
Wait a minute!

294
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,176
I don't want to hear!

295
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,643
Listen to me!

296
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,476
Okay. Speak your mind, please.

297
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,374
Leave your summer vacations
up to Sammy!

298
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:02,386
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

299
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:04,752
I'll even land on the beach!

300
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:07,958
Ugh, I ran out of breath!

301
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:09,459
You need some more training.

302
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:10,654
What?!

303
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:13,823
Wonderful. Really terrific.
Especially that winning pose.

304
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,366
Sammy! What are you doing here?

305
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,995
That should be my question, too!
Whose idea was it to come here?

306
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,573
That figures.

307
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:27,376
Sammy, meeting here means
you're merely a summer insect.

308
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,176
Come on, Love-love Monsters!

309
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:31,875
We saw them already...

310
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,416
It's rude to tell the truth, Ryo-Ohki.

311
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,044
Shut up!

312
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,885
This is the way it has to be!
Don't forget it!

313
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,515
S-Sorry.

314
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:42,219
Action!

315
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,561
Where is Peter?

316
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,063
Listen to what I tell you!

317
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,158
Sammy, who knows what's going
on, but here's your chance!

318
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,571
You can do it, Sammy!

319
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:55,840
I'll answer your cheers!

320
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,636
Converge, magic powers of justice!

321
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:58,903
Wait!

322
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,775
- Yes, you do need training.
- But he interrupted!

323
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:05,072
Are you all okay?

324
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,244
That was terrible,
bullying the animals I raise!

325
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:12,182
But they're Love-love Monsters;
they're evil beasts!

326
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:15,488
Why's that?! They haven't
done anything bad!

327
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,494
Now that you mention it...

328
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:19,826
It was Professor Washu that
wrecked the boat, too.

329
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:24,524
They're all quiet and good.
Monsters are human, too!

330
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,498
Wrong

331
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:27,972
Peter...

332
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,944
You're right. Not all of them
are completely bad, after all.

333
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,612
That's right, Sammy.

334
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,113
It's okay, right, Ryo-Ohki?

335
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,979
Of course!

336
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:43,452
Thank you! I promise not to let
the monsters do anything bad!

337
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,415
Thanks for the emotional show, Sammy.

338
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:50,552
But did you know that the
monsters came to this island...

339
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:54,360
...to strengthen themselves with
the magma energy underground?

340
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:56,560
Huh?! Do you mean...!

341
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,262
What do you mean?

342
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,937
She's sure stupid!
This island is doomed to erupt!

343
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:03,969
No way!

344
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,839
I'm afraid it's the honest truth.

345
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,535
Misa, that's horrible!

346
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:11,480
Oh, I'm afraid. So if
you'll excuse me. Bye.

347
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,485
- Sammy!
- Now we're in real trouble!

348
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,579
The magma's bubbling up!
The island will sink!

349
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,624
Everyone get to the boat!

350
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,320
That's right. It's gone.

351
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,697
Everyone! Get on!

352
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,562
We're saved!

353
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:29,793
Peter!

354
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:32,200
It's okay! I'm right beside you!

355
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,862
Peter...!

356
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:36,237
I've got to save them all!

357
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:39,470
- Hurry, Sammy!
- Sammy!

358
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:40,667
What should I do?

359
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,906
Sammy! The Coquettish Bomber!

360
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,876
Transport them somewhere
with your magical powers!

361
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:48,852
But how am I supposed
to do that?

362
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:53,691
I'll try! I'll give it a shot!

363
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,288
Please, let me rescue everyone
with my magical powers!

364
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:01,525
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

365
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,894
It's okay, Peter.

366
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:10,866
Get along with the monsters.
The fruit you gave me was delicious.

367
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:13,067
You're Sasami!

368
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:14,577
Oh! Chemistry Girl!

369
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:16,944
Don't forget me!

370
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:25,619
You did a wonderful job,
once again, Pretty Sammy.

371
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,393
Yes, that's still a little bitter.

372
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:37,765
My magnificent plan has ended
in complete failure.

373
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:41,431
Rumiya, I know you're out there.
Get on in here.

374
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,613
The island's sinking.

375
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,239
I wonder if Sammy's okay?

376
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,307
Yeah, Sammy's fine!

377
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:53,851
Huh?!

378
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,217
Sasami. Did you go to
the bathroom?

379
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:01,656
I got lost, but Pretty Sammy
carried me back here.

380
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,254
We have to thank the magical girl.

381
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,853
Yeah!

382
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,626
Huh? What happened?

383
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,565
What's going on? What happened?

384
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:16,733
Pretty Sammy put a stop to that
evil magical girl's ambitions.

385
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:20,669
What are you saying? I'm
asking what we're doing here!

386
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:23,680
So, like I was saying,
the magical girl...

387
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:25,716
Enough with that, Mihoshi!

388
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,720
- Hey, Ryo-Ohki?
- Yes?

389
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:31,688
Peter's fine, right?

390
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,724
- I'm sure.
- Yeah.

391
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,358
You're early today,
Love-love Master.

392
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,396
Yes, everyone got up early.

393
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,097
Good-bye, then.

394
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:49,533
Thank you, Sasami.

395
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:52,777
This is a beautiful place!

396
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:06,849
Anata ga mitsumeteru

397
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:12,185
...hontou no watashi janai.

00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:21,495

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,001

Onna no roman yo.
