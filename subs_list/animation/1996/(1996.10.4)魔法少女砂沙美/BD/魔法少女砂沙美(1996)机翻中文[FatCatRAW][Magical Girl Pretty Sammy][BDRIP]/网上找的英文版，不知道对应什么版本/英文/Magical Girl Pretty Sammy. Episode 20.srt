1
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:14,109
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,976
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:20,644
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:23,516
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:32,753
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:35,096
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:39,566
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:43,400
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,442
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:50,070
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,249
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:56,012
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:00,822
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:04,426
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:07,190
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:10,929
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,359
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,307
What's the matter? Are you okay?

19
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:55,710
Hey, are you all right?!

20
00:01:57,212 --> 00:02:00,773
It's nothing serious. Just
a bit of a fever, that's all.

21
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,010
Oh, no! I'll take you
to the nurse's office!

22
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:06,276
I can go by myself.
Gym class is gonna start...

23
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:07,981
...so go on ahead.

24
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,054
No way! I'm not gonna
just leave you.

25
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:13,394
Hold on. There.

26
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:17,661
I'm sorry, um....

27
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,427
Sasami!

28
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,203
I'm Sasami Kawai!

29
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,871
Thank you, Sasami...

30
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:28,643
No problem! That's what
friends are for!

31
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:30,269
Huh...?

32
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:31,903
No?

33
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:35,783
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

34
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,613
No...

35
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:39,210
...I'm fine.

36
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:43,552
That was how Sasami
and I first met.

37
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:49,864
And Sasami was the first
friend I ever had.

38
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:53,197
Friends

39
00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:57,837
It can't be...!

40
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,209
S-Sasami!

41
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:04,973
No...!

42
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:15,515
I am Pixy Misa,
the evil magical girl.

43
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,689
I've been cruel to everyone,
and I've fought against Sammy.

44
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:24,687
That was me. It was I
who was the bad girl.

45
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:26,996
I was the one who caused
so much trouble.

46
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,537
It was me!

47
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:33,100
Sasami must be so angry.

48
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,233
She must've told everyone
I tricked her all along.

49
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:39,309
What should I do...?

50
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,346
I haven't got anywhere
left to go.

51
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:45,343
I can't even see Dad anymore.

52
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:48,346
I... I...

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,967
This is all myfault.

54
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,968
It's my fault for
listening to my sister...

55
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,266
...and making Misao
transform into Misa.

56
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,744
M-My chest...!

57
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:13,447
She forcefully undid
her transformation...

58
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:15,813
...so it started working
backward! I can't leave her!

59
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:18,011
I've gotta call Sis.
My magic isn't strong enough!

60
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,758
Be patient a little longer, Misao!

61
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:27,186
Nice to meet you!!

62
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:28,251
No!!

63
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,354
Time for my magical
transformation!

64
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,400
Don't come out! Please!

65
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:34,758
Don't come out!

66
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,103
I just can't believe that
Misao was Pixy Misa.

67
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:42,234
Misao's had an evil magic
spell cast on her.

68
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,937
An evil magic spell?

69
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:48,108
Otherwise that shy Misao
couldn't have turned into Misa.

70
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:52,385
Someone forced her to transform,
to interfere with Sammy.

71
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,247
You mean... If I hadn't
turned into Sammy...

72
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:59,316
...Misao wouldn't have
turned into Misa?

73
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,588
I don't know.
But that's possible.

74
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:06,263
Then it's my fault.

75
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,461
It's my fault for getting
her into this mess.

76
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:12,472
Misao turned into Misa all
because I accepted this baton!

77
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:16,035
I knew I should have
given it back, then!

78
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,038
This stupid baton!
This stupid baton!

79
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,082
I don't want it!!

80
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,020
Sasami!

81
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:32,086
I'm going to look for Misao.
Don't follow me, Ryo-Ohki.

82
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,391
Sasami...

83
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,135
I'm sorry, Sasami.

84
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,294
Where are you going, Tsunami?

85
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,833
You are only allowed to
descend to the Earth once...

86
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,343
...during the queen's
deliberation process.

87
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,471
Break the rules, and we'll strip
you of your qualifications...

88
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,482
...as candidate to be queen.

89
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,847
It doesn't matter.

90
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,615
Sasami Kawai
is the girl you chose.

91
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:03,020
Won't you believe in her?

92
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,893
Misao! Misao!!

93
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,862
Yes, that's right.

94
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:16,370
It isn't magical powers
that can save Misao.

95
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,998
You are the only one
who can save her.

96
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:23,339
Please, Sasami.
Save your friend!

97
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,447
Hello, CD Vision.

98
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,245
Oh, Mrs. Amano.

99
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:32,981
Yes, that's right. Misao
isn't over there, is she?

100
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:37,481
I see. No,
thank you very much.

101
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:42,388
No luck. It looks like she's
not at Sasami's place, either.

102
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:45,489
She couldn't be caught up in
that monster's wake, could she?

103
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:49,834
I don't think we need to worry about
that, since everyone returned to normal.

104
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:52,434
But if she doesn't
come home soon...

105
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,475
...I'll call her teacher.

106
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,478
Yes, I suppose.

107
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:05,044
You know, she really was
looking forward to seeing you.

108
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,989
Dear, when are you leaving
for your next performance?

109
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,925
I have to leave Japan
tomorrow morning.

110
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:34,514
I want to see Dad.

111
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,752
What is it?

112
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:41,622
Nothing. Nothing at all.

113
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:54,132
Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis!

114
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,168
Sis!

115
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:59,063
Misao's in trouble!
We can't just leave her...

116
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:05,478
It's all over.
The Project to make me queen...

117
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,306
Keep your chin up, Sis.

118
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:11,211
Misao!

119
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:14,677
Misao! Misao!

120
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:17,324
Misao!

121
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:28,369
I want to see you.

122
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,673
I really want to see you.
Where are you?

123
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,482
I can't go back home...

124
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,545
Misao?

125
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:50,557
What are you doing in
a place like this?

126
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,155
Aren't you going back home?

127
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,129
I'll go home soon.

128
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,132
Oh?

129
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,728
Um...

130
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,100
Yes?

131
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:06,698
Um, I have a very close friend.

132
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:10,235
But I've been lying to her
all along, without knowing it.

133
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:13,710
I'm sure she's really mad at me.

134
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:16,180
Did you say you were sorry?

135
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:18,108
There's no way
she'd forgive me!

136
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:20,586
You won't know
until you tell her.

137
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:24,557
And if you tell her
exactly what you think...

138
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,752
...I'm sure your friend
will understand.

139
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,565
There, there. It's gotten
a little chilly out.

140
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,828
Misao, it's getting late.

141
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:37,928
Why not go home, and apologize
to your friend tomorrow?

142
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:42,404
But...

143
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:45,810
But, Sasami won't forgive me.

144
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,186
All the things that are
important to me...

145
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:00,853
Mom, Dad, Sasami...

146
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,498
...the bird, Dad's piano piece...

147
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:08,433
...my hair bands, the picture of
Dad and I at the amusement park.

148
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,237
And also... also...

149
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:17,772
This place.

150
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:40,198
I had a feeling
you might come here.

151
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,760
After all, it's the place
where you and I first met!

152
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:47,574
Wait!

153
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:50,041
Look at me!

154
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,009
No!

155
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:52,909
- Look at me!
- No!

156
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,817
What's the matter, Misao?
Are you in pain?

157
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,843
What is it? What's going on?!

158
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:02,685
She's trying to change to Misa.

159
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:03,917
Ryo-Ohki!

160
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,154
The evil magic in her heart
is swelling up!

161
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:10,129
How can we make her
change back into Misao?

162
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:14,635
Please tell me!

163
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:16,829
Sasami. Magic isn't omnipotent.

164
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,301
I don't wanna hear that!!

165
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:23,743
But magic will react to
people's feelings toward others.

166
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,705
The only one who can remove the
evil magic from Misao's heart...

167
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:31,373
...is you, because you care
the most for Misao.

168
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,857
I can...?

169
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:40,494
For Misao...

170
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:44,928
Use your strength and magic
and align your heart with Misao's.

171
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:51,896
Sorry that I threw you
and stuff, earlier.

172
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:55,238
Please give me the strength
I need to save Misao!

173
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:06,920
Pretty Mutation...

174
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,889
...Magical Recall!

175
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:21,165
Just wait, Misao!
I'll save you soon!

176
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:24,102
Because I'm going to
drive away this evil magic!

177
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:39,382
This is the inside
of Misao's heart...

178
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,760
Misao...

179
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,462
Misao!

180
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:13,847
Misao...

181
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,185
Who would've thought you'd
come all the way in here.

182
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:21,519
Pretty Sammy.
No, Sasami Kawai!!

183
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:23,119
Misa!

184
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,961
Welcome to the inside
of Misao's heart!

185
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:30,796
Misa! Change Misao back to
normal, and get out of here!!

186
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:36,201
You don't understand a thing.
Misa is Misao, and Misao is Misa.

187
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:40,108
The sad feelings in her heart,
along with the magical powers...

188
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:42,274
...are what brought me
into the world.

189
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,874
Me, Pixy Misa.

190
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:46,579
In otherwords, we're
one and the same person.

191
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,152
No...! Misao!

192
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,856
Misao doesn't want to see
the likes of you!

193
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,291
Why not?

194
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:54,828
It's all your fault!

195
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,385
My fault...?

196
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:59,797
You were covering for Misao
all along, weren't you.

197
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:03,995
Misao developed a real complex
about you, over that.

198
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:09,474
"I'm so timid. I envy
Sasami, who's so cheery."

199
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:12,773
Misao's not like that at all!

200
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:15,748
That's what the other
side of me said.

201
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:17,477
It couldn't be a lie.

202
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:19,917
And when you were
covering for Misao...

203
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:23,252
...you were probably steeping
in a superiority complex, huh.

204
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:26,987
Thinking, "I'm saving
poor, weak little Misao."

205
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:28,653
That's not true!

206
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:31,527
You really loved
saving Misao, didn't you.

207
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:36,727
You were proud of yourself
for saving Misao, right?

208
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:40,006
No! That's not true, Misao!

209
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,238
And now you're going
to save her again?

210
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,544
You're being a nuisance!!

211
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:50,514
I just... I...

212
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,952
Get out of here! Now!!

213
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,013
I...

214
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:01,524
Misao, listen to me.

215
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:04,587
The very first time
I talked to you...

216
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:08,966
...you were really struggling,
and I admired you!

217
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,833
Even though you had a fever,
and you were in pain...

218
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:15,432
...you smiled at me. Remember?

219
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:19,408
I'm your friend, right?

220
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,915
We're friends, so can't
I want to be together?

221
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:26,509
We're friends, so can't
I want to help you?

222
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:31,753
You've given me so many things!

223
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:35,061
That's why... that's why...

224
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:40,022
There are so many things
I still want to do with you!!

225
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:44,003
Like playing, and staying over,
and going on trips...

226
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:45,402
...and comparing homework!

227
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:47,998
There's lots and lots
and lots of things!!

228
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:50,509
Please, Misao! Answer me!!

229
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:53,445
Misao! Answer me!!

230
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,457
Even if you stay
as Pixy Misa forever...

231
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,824
...I'll still really love you, Misao!

232
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,001
Sa...

233
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,361
Sa-sa-mi...

234
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:25,937
Sasami!

235
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,605
Misao!

236
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,649
I'm sorry, Sasami!

237
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,842
I... I...

238
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:35,655
I want to be your friend!

239
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:39,021
We are friends! Of course.

240
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,152
I want to be with you!

241
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,688
I'll always be with you, Misao!

242
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:48,602
I care so much for you!

243
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,400
I care about you, too, Misao!

244
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,148
Sasami!

245
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:04,946
Misao.

246
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:09,849
I'm going to get better.
I'm gonna try my best.

247
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:12,792
Yeah.

248
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:14,488
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:16,530
Don't apologize.

250
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,401
What is it?

251
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:33,807
Sasami!

252
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:37,908
That's the true form of the evil
magic that was in your heart.

253
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,484
Misao, let's do it together!

254
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:57,961
Converge, magic powers of justice!

255
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,200
Pretty Coquettish Bomber!!

256
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,331
Misa.

257
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:39,475
Good-bye, Pixy Misa.

258
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:43,273
The other side of me.

259
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:56,659
Sasa...!

260
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:09,135
That's great!

261
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,445
Thank you, Pretty Sammy.

262
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,148
Good-bye, Misao.

263
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:24,852
I'm coming back, for sure.
I'll see you soon, Misao.

264
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:33,659
Hurry, Dad! Misao will
get tired of waiting!

265
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,205
Thanks, Dad!

266
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,307
Good-night!

267
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,467
Good-night!

268
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:47,674
What's going on? Suddenly
Sasami seems kind of grown up.

269
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:49,916
Must be imagining it.

270
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,852
Misao!

271
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:56,789
Huh?

272
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:59,325
Misao!

273
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:02,391
Sorry I'm late!

274
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:04,431
There were these runaway
horses on the way...

275
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,329
WHAT?!!

276
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:09,236
Welcome, Sasami!

277
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:11,204
I'M PIXY MISA!
Welcome, Sasami!

278
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:12,670
What...?!!

279
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:16,437
Did I scare you?
I made it to try to get better...

280
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:21,374
...and to try to cheer myself up!
What do you think?

281
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:26,186
Misao! I don't think that's the
right way to cheer yourself up.

282
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,153
Huh?

283
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:30,890
Really?

284
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:34,923
Misao, are you sad because
you couldn't see your dad?

285
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:39,322
No! I'm fine, because
I've got you here!

286
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:19,232
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

287
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:25,572
...but I was wrong.

288
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:33,785
To say there are any number
of guys out there...

289
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:38,188
...I should've known better.

290
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:43,025
Midnight,

291
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:46,161
Comes to anyone,

292
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:51,531
...not only to Cinderella.

293
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:58,033
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

294
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,908
...but I've made light
of the whole world.

295
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:12,790
To think that somehow things
would turn out all right...

296
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,490
...I should've known better.

297
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:30,405
Misao's going to play the
piano at the school festival.

298
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:34,379
I sure wish her dad could hear
her playing that beautiful song!

299
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,482
Coming next: I'm Glad to
Have the Mystic Force.

300
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:40,452
I'm glad I became Sammy!
