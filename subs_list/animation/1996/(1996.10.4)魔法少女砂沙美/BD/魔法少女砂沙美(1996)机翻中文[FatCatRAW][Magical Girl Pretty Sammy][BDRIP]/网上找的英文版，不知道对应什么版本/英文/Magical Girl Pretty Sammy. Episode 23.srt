1
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:14,302
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:17,169
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:20,735
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:23,710
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:32,946
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:35,289
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:39,759
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:43,593
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:47,635
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:50,263
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:54,442
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,205
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:01,015
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:04,619
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,383
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:11,088
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,553
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,507
I'm your totally UNaverage
grade 4 student...

19
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:39,985
...Magical Girl Pretty Sammy! Yay!

20
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:42,215
Now that Misao was released
from Misa's bonds....

21
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,758
...our lives have sure
returned to normal!

22
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:46,726
Or so I thought.

23
00:01:46,794 --> 00:01:50,355
Then some unbelievable people
showed up around us!

24
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,762
Oh, no!

25
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,266
The leader is named...

26
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:56,394
...the third magical girl,
Love Me Eimi!

27
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,937
Eimi!

28
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,768
Don't act so friendly!!

29
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:03,277
So I transformed into Sammy
to face them off...

30
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:07,446
...but Love Me Eimi's Lovely
Monsters are very strong!

31
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,874
I'm not a match for them at all!

32
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:15,311
Goddess of Destruction

33
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,947
Right! Left! Do your stuff!

34
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,584
Right!

35
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,591
Left!

36
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,294
Sammy!

37
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:31,162
Sammy!

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,308
That's the end of Sammy!

39
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:36,272
Use it, Sammy!

40
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:37,436
Use what?!

41
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,479
Teleport magic!

42
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,438
- Oh, yeah!
- Hurry!

43
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:44,006
Um, uh... Pretty Teleport!!

44
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:46,043
You did it!

45
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:47,514
Sammy vanished!

46
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:50,352
Sammy! It's against school
rules to run away!

47
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:54,087
It really is! You're
gonna be in big trouble!!

48
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:58,160
Ryo-Ohki, where did Sammy go?

49
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:02,293
I don't know. Pretty Teleport magic
hasn't been perfected.

50
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,496
Huh?!

51
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,539
Sasami...

52
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:14,181
Oh! Dad!

53
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,340
Welcome, Pretty Sammy!

54
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:19,886
Hello. Sorry to drop in like this.

55
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,922
And with your shoes still on, too!

56
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:25,325
Uh, you see...! Well...
Oh! What to do?!

57
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:27,361
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,654
Sammy, we're very happy
that you dropped by...

59
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,595
...but Sasami's still at school.

60
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,497
No, uh... that's okay.

61
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:35,562
I've got a bad feeling.

62
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,599
Please, eat up.

63
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,006
It's much bigger than normal.

64
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:47,070
- It's delicious, Sammy.
- Have as much as you like.

65
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:51,551
Um, uh, I really do have to run...

66
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:57,914
But it's my homemade cake!
Won't you have some?

67
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:00,884
So, you won't have any?

68
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:03,226
It really is delicious, you know!

69
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:05,197
Sammy!!

70
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,992
I'll have some! I'll
have some cake, okay?!

71
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,772
Oh, my. Oh, my.

72
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:15,738
But it does look delicious.

73
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,437
What was that?

74
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:21,503
Um, it's unthinkable that Sammy
would sit around eating cake...

75
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:26,076
...seeing as an evil magical girl is
around. Some magical girl SHE is.

76
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,788
We have no choice.

77
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:32,053
I must suspend the queen's
final ascension ceremony.

78
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,121
If Gemini's balance is not restored...

79
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,625
We will not be able to move
Juraihelm to its normal space.

80
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:47,202
Oh, what shall I do?
I feel so helpless.

81
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:49,634
It seems you've run into
some problems, Mistress Tsunami.

82
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,375
You!

83
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:58,210
But is this appropriate?

84
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:01,584
Think of it as a pre-celebration
of the queen's ascension.

85
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:06,516
I'm concerned about the magical girl
who appeared recently.

86
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:09,688
I see. Then please look after it.

87
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:12,132
Leave it to me.

88
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,261
But still, Sammy...

89
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,405
You're such a fool, Sammy.
Compared to her...

90
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:22,169
...your magical girl's pretty tough.

91
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,033
Things are looking good.

92
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:26,136
I'm so glad you like her.

93
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,607
Keep getting her to
give Sammy all she's got.

94
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,082
Yes, I will.

95
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:33,620
Let's get her to do something
even more evil.

96
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,028
Here it comes!
My head is vibrating!

97
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,620
Do something evil!

98
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:44,520
Ready, Left?

99
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:45,860
Ready, Right?

100
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:49,699
Do something evil, but don't
break the school rules!

101
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,397
Yes!

102
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,297
Left! Right!

103
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:55,940
Love Me...

104
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,036
...Cross Attack!

105
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:02,175
- Saw it...
-...with all your magical powers!

106
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,991
Oh, look out!

107
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,725
At least we'll die together, Hiroto!

108
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,562
Let's run for it, instead!

109
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:24,093
- Wait for me!
- Help!

110
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:36,808
Hey! Get up and run by yourself!

111
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:39,315
I wonder what they're doing?

112
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:42,913
Maybe they're trying to
cut the Earth in half.

113
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,285
I see. No wonder you're
our teacher.

114
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:48,625
THAT SPELLS TROUBLE!

115
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,665
Don't worry. The UN
Peace Corps will come.

116
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:54,065
The Lovely Madams
did them in already.

117
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:56,070
So that means...

118
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,528
The Earth will be split in two.
We're in big trouble!!

119
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,843
Sammy!

120
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:05,371
Come again some time!

121
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,445
We'll be waiting for you,
homemade cake and all!

122
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,110
Uh, sure!
Thanks for the cake!

123
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:14,181
My stomach's gonna burst!

124
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,052
- Sammy!
- Huh?

125
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,721
Misao!

126
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,554
What were you doing at home?

127
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:21,492
Please, don't ask.

128
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:24,694
Forget that, we've got
big trouble! Look at that!

129
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:26,893
Huh? What's that?

130
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,765
I know! It's a giant carpenter!

131
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,805
Oh, Ginji! You're so right!

132
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,339
I see! A giant carpenter!

133
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,370
No way on earth!

134
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,383
Uh, okay...

135
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,180
Love Me Eimi On Stage

136
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:53,750
It's a beautiful day...

137
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:57,492
Hello, everybody!

138
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,792
I'm known as Magical Girl...

139
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:04,263
...Love Me...

140
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,399
...Eimi!

141
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,939
I'm a hard working gal!

142
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,374
I follow the rules and...

143
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,582
...discipline and...

144
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,619
What's with this song?! It stinks!!

145
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,019
If you listen closely to the lyrics,
it's full of contradictions.

146
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:33,391
I'm gonna use the magical
power to protect this planet.

147
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:39,296
The Earth should be destroyed.

148
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:49,738
Wonder if everyone's all right?!

149
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,444
We've got to hurry!

150
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:58,259
La la la, let's destroy it!

151
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,228
Eimi, Guardian of the Universe
La la la, let's destroy it!

152
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,490
You jerk! What are you
trying to pull?!

153
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:06,023
This is all for the Earth's sake!

154
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,331
But you're destroying it!!

155
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:11,803
If you get in my way,
I'll destroy you, as well!

156
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:15,071
Hiroto, at least we'll
be destroyed together!

157
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:16,632
Get destroyed on your own.

158
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,907
If you're gonna destroy them,
you'll have to destroy me first!

159
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,746
- Miss Mihoshi...!
- You're like a real teacher!
- How admirable!

160
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,910
I thought you were already
done in a long time ago.

161
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:31,588
Okay, I'll give you what
you want! Say your good-byes!

162
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,629
Hey, that's dangerous!
Who's doing that?!

163
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:44,570
That's...

164
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:46,697
She came back!

165
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,742
Cool Red, of the Blue Sky Rangers!

166
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:49,707
Is not!!

167
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,039
- She's right!
- Huh?

168
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,148
Cool Red, of the Blue
Sky Rangers has arrived!

169
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:08,261
Wh-What's going on?!

170
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,797
Oh, my. This is a problem.

171
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:13,492
Who are you?!

172
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,865
As I said, I'm Cool Red,
of the Blue Sky Rangers.

173
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:18,336
Aren't you embarrassed,
walking around in that outfit?

174
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,669
I don't want to hear that,
coming from you!

175
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,902
Now stop this destruction of yours!

176
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,569
Not a chance!

177
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,309
She's better than I thought!

178
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,377
We're counting on you, Cool Red!

179
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,252
Because Sammy ran away!

180
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:38,354
You're the only one
we can count on!

181
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:39,414
Count on me!

182
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:42,394
Looks like you completely lost
your chance to make an appearance!

183
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:44,055
Yeah.

184
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:47,157
But I wonder who's
wearing that costume?

185
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,366
Dunno.

186
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,014
I won't let you stop me!

187
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:05,784
Left! Right! Put your sawing
attack on the back burner!

188
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:08,014
Attack Cool Red!

189
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:13,827
Sky Cannon!

190
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,835
Don't be so weak!

191
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,005
Not too shabby.

192
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:35,882
Go, Red!

193
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,144
It's against school rules
not to do your best!

194
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:39,378
Excuse me...

195
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,512
I'm in the middle
of something here!

196
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,022
I'll deal with you later.

197
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:45,058
Oh...

198
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:46,426
That's Sammy!

199
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:50,520
Oh, my. I thought she'd be
too embarrassed to show her face.

200
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:55,124
Anyway, count on Sammy when
it comes to magical incidents!

201
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:59,233
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy. I've
arrived, despite my embarrassment.

202
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:09,507
Uh, could you at least look
at my official pose?

203
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:10,850
No, thanks.

204
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:12,977
The whole world's in danger!
What've you been doing, Sammy?!

205
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,486
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

206
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:17,490
Don't tell us you were just
sitting around eating cake!

207
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:19,920
Actually, that's exactly
what I was doing.

208
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:21,726
Fool.

209
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:23,495
How adorable, Sammy!

210
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:24,997
Gee, thanks.

211
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,924
- That's the way it is, huh?
- Yeah.

212
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,867
Just in time, Sammy.

213
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:37,838
Someone is controlling
Love Me Eimi from afar.

214
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:38,900
What?!

215
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:42,380
She's got to have some kind of
receiver on her. Destroy it!

216
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,744
Right!

217
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:48,216
Pretty Sammy, do you really
think you can win against me?!

218
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:51,184
I'm not too confident,
but still...!

219
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:53,890
- Come on, Sammy!
- Do it, Sammy!

220
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,896
I'll forgive you for everything!
Now just go and get her!

221
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:59,262
I'm rooting for you!
You've gotta win!

222
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,858
- Please, Sammy!
- Looking good, Sammy!

223
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:05,434
Okay! Thanks! I'll do my best!

224
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:07,372
- Here goes!
- Try it!

225
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:08,931
Uh... um... er...

226
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:10,977
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?!

227
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,580
Um... well... hm...

228
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,583
Where's the receiver...?

229
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,418
Sammy...

230
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,455
Can't you see
the antenna on her head?

231
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:23,922
Oh, THAT!

232
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:25,652
This isn't looking good.

233
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:28,456
No, it isn't.

234
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,498
This leaves no choice but
to resort to the final plan.

235
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,933
H-Hey, wait! What's
this final plan of yours?

236
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:36,970
Hey! Romio!

237
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,272
It's a secret.

238
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,612
Eimi! This time I'm really coming!

239
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:51,749
I don't trust you, so
I'm making the first move!

240
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:53,308
What?! Not fair!

241
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:56,445
Pretty Coquettish Bomber!

242
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:05,863
Huh?! What's going on?!

243
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,924
I feel so weird!

244
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:11,236
I knew it...

245
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,203
Ow!

246
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:15,132
Way to go, Sammy!

247
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,743
What?!

248
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:21,804
This outfit...!
I've broken the school rules!

249
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:25,978
Teacher! I can't remember a thing!
It's not my fault!

250
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:29,022
Oh, the biggest mistake
of Eimi Date's life!

251
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,780
"Eimi"...?

252
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:33,655
You're not the
class leader, are you?!

253
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:37,189
Oh, please don't
expel me from school!

254
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:39,732
Well, now. What shall I do?

255
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:42,467
You're choking me!

256
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:44,671
Nice going, Pretty Sammy.

257
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:47,974
Now, for my job!

258
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:55,410
Without the magical girl's
help, you're nothing!

259
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:09,095
Who are you?

260
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:14,330
Sorry to hide like that. I'm the
magic secret guard from Juraihelm.

261
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,996
They call me,
the Overly-Splendid Oryo.

262
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:23,443
Thank you, Sammy and Oryo!

263
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:26,075
Well done, Tsunami.

264
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:29,946
We can accept you as
the queen of Juraihelm.

265
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:31,985
We can!

266
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:37,913
Now, please take Juraihelm
to its former position in space...

267
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:40,391
...just like the days of yore!

268
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:42,360
Yes.

269
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:09,054
Magic secret guard...?

270
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:12,216
A magic secret guard is one
of the people who works...

271
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,260
...to protect the queen of Juraihelm.

272
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:15,760
For the queen?

273
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:18,957
You mean Tsunami became the queen?

274
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:22,934
Yes, Tsunami is my next mistress.

275
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,438
Take a look.

276
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:34,443
The moon got bigger!

277
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:35,503
That's...!

278
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:38,847
Right. The magical kingdom
of Juraihelm.

279
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:42,486
Tsunami!

280
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,820
Mistress Tsunami! I mean, Queen!

281
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:50,189
Nice to meet you,
people of the Earth.

282
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,093
I am Queen of the magical
kingdom of Juraihelm.

283
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:55,657
My name is Tsunami.

284
00:16:56,436 --> 00:17:00,805
Some of you must be surprised
by the expanding moon...

285
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:03,233
But this is the original moon.

286
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,336
No, this is the real
appearance of Juraihelm.

287
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,215
Juraihelm and Earth were
originally twin planets.

288
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:13,218
But over the course of many years...

289
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:16,983
... the two planets went
their separate ways.

290
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:19,717
Earth pursued
a materialistic culture.

291
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,954
And Juraihelm pursued
a spiritual culture.

292
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,729
A one-dimensional advancement
has no benefits for either planet.

293
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,995
A new world can be created by
joining the planets 'strengths.

294
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:34,871
We can plant flowers across
the world and the universe!

295
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:40,073
Oh, my. What's wrong?
Please wait a moment.

296
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,806
You've been watching
a disgraceful broadcast.

297
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,716
Please ignore everything
you've just heard.

298
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:48,254
She's...!

299
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,186
Who is she?

300
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:53,886
Mistress Romio! She was the
third candidate to be queen.

301
00:17:55,362 --> 00:18:00,595
Our magical kingdom of Juraihelm
will be destroying Earth.

302
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,837
What's that supposed to mean?!

303
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:08,764
I don't know. But trouble is
brewing in Juraihelm, for certain!

304
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:10,406
Romio!

305
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,809
What do you mean, "destroy Earth"?!

306
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:15,109
Tsunami's already become the queen!

307
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:16,410
That's irrelevant.

308
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:17,450
Say what?!

309
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:19,542
I'm destroying the Earth...

310
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:23,856
...because that's what I desire.

311
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:34,131
What's happening...?

312
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,635
My magic... my powers
are disappearing!

313
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:42,268
This is the device I designed
to absorb magical power.

314
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,310
The NT System.

315
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:52,284
My magical powers are disappearing!

316
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,257
Why are you doing this?!

317
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:07,197
Your memory isn't very good.

318
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:10,964
I told you. I'm going
to destroy the Earth.

319
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:14,273
If only Eimi had gotten rid of Sammy,
and Tsunami hadn't become queen...

320
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:19,074
...I wouldn't need to
do this. Too bad.

321
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:22,371
Ramia, you're no longer needed.

322
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:25,077
Thanks for your trouble.
I'm taking your magic...

323
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:27,449
...so just dry up and blow away.

324
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,927
Rumiya...

325
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:39,999
Sis! You okay?!

326
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,029
Oh, my powers...!

327
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:45,071
Darn it!

328
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:52,178
Sis! You're risking
your life to save me!

329
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:53,341
Sis!

330
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:56,473
No! You're going to seek help
from Pretty Sammy!

331
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:57,717
For my sake!

332
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:00,117
Oh, Sis!!!

333
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:08,852
What do you think you'll prove
by getting Pretty Sammy's help?

334
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,829
It's totally unlikely.

335
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:13,863
What a hateful planet.

336
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:16,801
That planet and Juraihelm
couldn't be the same.

337
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:20,372
Those beings on Earth called "humans"...

338
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,238
They're destroying their own planet.

339
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:27,706
Those people are the mites
of the universe!

340
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,751
- What's going on up there?
- Tsunami...

341
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:42,554
I've reached my limit
pulling all-nighters.

342
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:46,565
But it's finally complete!

343
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:50,361
My newly developed NT System.

344
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:54,430
My super, wonderful NT System!

345
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:17,294
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

346
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:23,595
...but I was wrong.

347
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:31,536
To say there are any number
of guys out there...

348
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:36,139
... I should've known better.

349
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:40,846
Midnight,

350
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:43,985
Comes to anyone,

351
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:49,492
...not only to Cinderella.

352
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:55,900
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

353
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:02,972
...but I've made light
of the whole world.

354
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:10,575
To think that somehow things
would turn out all right...

355
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,451
...I should've known better.

356
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:30,663
Romio, from the magical kingdom is
trying to sink the Earth into the sun.

357
00:22:30,737 --> 00:22:32,398
