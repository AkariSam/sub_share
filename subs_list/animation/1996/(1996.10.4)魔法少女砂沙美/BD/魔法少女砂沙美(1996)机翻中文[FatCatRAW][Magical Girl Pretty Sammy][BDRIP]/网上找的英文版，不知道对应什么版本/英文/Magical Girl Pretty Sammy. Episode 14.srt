1
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,647
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,514
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,047
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,012
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,292
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,634
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,105
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,939
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,981
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,609
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,754
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,517
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,361
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,931
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,695
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,333
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,867
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,573
So this is it.
My new battlefield.

19
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,717
Chibiroku!

20
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,155
Dosumasa!

21
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,384
- Gariko.
- Yes!

22
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,594
Let's go!

23
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,989
Children age fast;
we must study hard.

24
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,692
Best to repay our parents now,
while they're still here.

25
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:23,643
The Fellow Called Boss

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,611
BOSS

27
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:31,810
And so, Boss and his followers
have transferred here today.

28
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,853
Pleasure's mine.

29
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,587
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,794
They're scared out of their wits!

31
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,094
Wonder what their story is?

32
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,757
They're kind of creepy.

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,824
I have a question, teacher!

34
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,836
Oh, my. What's that?

35
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,431
I dunno what you mean by "Boss."
I'd like to know his real name.

36
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,407
Huh...?
But isn't his name "Boss"?

37
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,076
Dead silence

38
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,307
I'm Boss! I don't
go by anything else!

39
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,520
B-But I said, I don't get it!

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,024
Are you really an
elementary school student?!

41
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,523
Woo-ee!

42
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,461
I won't put up with your asking
Boss such rude questions!

43
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,994
Boss is 10 years and 6 months old!
A boy in excellent health!

44
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,400
A superior elementary
school student!

45
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,461
What's the story with the
rest of you?!

46
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,501
We're Boss's faithful servants.

47
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,436
We came together,
inspired by his manliness.

48
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,881
Excuse me, but knives and things
are forbidden at school.

49
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,312
F-Forget it...!

50
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,817
For some reason, I've got
a splitting headache!

51
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,251
Um, so you understand, Eimi?

52
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,228
I don't get it at all!!

53
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,288
How could girls possibly
understand men, after all?!

54
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,724
So I'll tell you this up front!

55
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:00,204
I'm Boss, so I'm gonna need
strict control over this school!

56
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,707
Who currently guards the school?!

57
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,674
What?

58
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,006
What does he mean,
"guards the school"?

59
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,104
No idea. Never heard of it.

60
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,708
Boss, I don't think
they get your drift.

61
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,887
They don't understand
Boss-Talk, huh...?!

62
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,718
Okay, who's the strongest
in the school?!

63
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,255
- Who is it?!
- Answer him!

64
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,732
This is stupid! How come our
class gets all the freaks?!

65
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,925
YOU!

66
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,897
What did you say, just now?!
Speak up!

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,673
Where'd YOU come from...?!

68
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,438
Say it!
Whose name did you say?!

69
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,672
Who's the strongest
in this school?!

70
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,439
The strongest...?

71
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,750
Hiroto!

72
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,719
Absent

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,651
He's not here?!

74
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,451
Who?! Who is it?! Answer me!!

75
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,490
Him...!

76
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,931
You?!

77
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,200
You?!

78
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,870
Huh?!

79
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,202
OH, NO!!

80
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,333
So, it's you...

81
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,369
N-No! I'm just your
typical, frail little girl!

82
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,074
See?

83
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,651
Hold your horses! There's
been a misunderstanding!

84
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,121
Aha, the bell.

85
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,527
All right,
that's it for homeroom.

86
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:35,795
Boss and you others, hurry and
seat yourselves at the back.

87
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,436
You narrowly escaped.
What's your name?

88
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,263
Sasami. Sasami Kawai.

89
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,640
Sasami Kawai, huh. Got it.

90
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,809
- Sasami...
- Mm-hm.

91
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,283
Boss, boys these days
are wearing skirts, huh.

92
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,447
Wrong!!

93
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,184
Um... are you actually
a little boy, Sasami?

94
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,464
I can't believe they think
Sasami is a boy...

95
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,160
What's with that guy?!
Is he really human?

96
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,737
Why, that...!
She took the last one!

97
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,139
Oh. Maybe it's in the
dictionary of magic.

98
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,269
Hold this. I'll look it up.

99
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,039
Right.

100
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,607
Uh... Oh, my. How about
cleaning up a little, Ramia?

101
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:25,847
Sure thing.

102
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,715
Dictionary... dictionary...

103
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,554
Got it!

104
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,250
"Boss"... "Boss"...

105
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,849
Here it is!

106
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:37,453
"Boss: generally a gigantic being
that inhabits schools."

107
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,354
"Increases subordinates
with brute force."

108
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,798
"Reigns over all, using
a school as his haunt."

109
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,859
"Likes include fights, weaklings..."

110
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,872
"...friendship, duty,
humanity, manhood, etc."

111
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,908
- What's that mean?!
- Who knows?

112
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,845
Incredible! Nothing but
weirdoes down there!

113
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,907
His stare's gonna burn
a hole through my head!

114
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,982
Oh!

115
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,076
What do you mean, "Oh," Ramia?

116
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,850
It's nothing.

117
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,890
Really?

118
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,925
I've got it!

119
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,130
Ramia, the Genius!

120
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,692
What do you mean,
"Ha, ha, ha," Ramia?

121
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,028
It's nothing.

122
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,468
Really? By the way, can
I have my cracker back?

123
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,403
She remembered...!

124
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,534
Children! Today's lunch box day!

125
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,172
Did you all bring
your lunch boxes?

126
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,406
Yes!

127
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,575
I remembered to bring
mine along, too!

128
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,619
Ups-a-daisy!

129
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,852
Are you okay, Sasami?

130
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,187
Yeah, sure.

131
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,887
But Boss keeps glaring
at me, from behind.

132
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,328
- Lunch time!
- He's not there now...

133
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,628
I'll eat now,
while I have the chance!

134
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,669
Time for lunch.

135
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,730
Transform!

136
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,509
Hey, what's going on?!

137
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,475
Where are you going, Misao?

138
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm just going to transform...

139
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,447
Huh...?!

140
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:10,344
Sasami Kawai! I'll fight you to the end,
to repay you for what you've done!

141
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,051
My big fists will teach you
who's boss of this school.

142
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,958
Nice piece of prose, there, Boss!

143
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,963
When Sasami Kawai
reads this challenge...

144
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,465
...she'll be so taken aback,
she'll come up to the rooftop!

145
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,126
Then you'll beat her up, Boss...

146
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,466
...and she'll vow her allegiance
for all eternity!

147
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,802
Very sweet!!

148
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,307
W-Who're you?!

149
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,277
- And extremely mystic!
- Where are you?!

150
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,503
Over there!

151
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,071
Boss Missile!!

152
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,617
Pixy Catch!!

153
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,016
- Not bad.
- Pretty good, I'd say.

154
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,060
Who the heck are you?

155
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,495
I'm the magical girl of love
and ambition, Pixy Misa!

156
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,830
And this is my pet, Ru!

157
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,398
Got 'em, huh.

158
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,530
If only you'd lose
the wooden sandals!

159
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,972
Why me?! I stayed up
all night thinking this up!!

160
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,944
Pixy Misa...?

161
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,982
Better look out, Boss.
According to my calculations...

162
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,176
...she's very dubious.

163
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,019
Oh...

164
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,682
You shouldn't judge others
by their appearance.

165
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:22,456
And to prove it, I'm gonna give
you some special information!

166
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,030
What's that mean?!

167
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,531
The strongest one in
this school isn't Sasami.

168
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,090
WHAT?!!

169
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:33,366
The strongest kid in
this school is Pretty Sammy.

170
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,098
Pretty Sammy?

171
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,698
Right. Pretty Sammy.

172
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,765
Is she a foreigner?

173
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,175
She's a magical girl!
Haven't you heard ofher?!

174
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,180
- Gariko!
- Right!

175
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,580
"Pretty Sammy. Rescues the weak,
crushes the strong..."

176
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,143
"A pretty cute fighter for justice."
That's what it says.

177
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,524
Hm. If it's in your dictionary,
then it must be true.

178
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,526
Now, do you get it? You'll be the
strongest once you've blown Sammy away.

179
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,999
If you'd like, I'll tell you
how you can fight Sammy.

180
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,332
Yeah, let's hear it! Guys!
We'll rewrite that challenge!

181
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,171
Yeah!

182
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,472
Hey, Misa. You really think
this is gonna work?

183
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,476
Best way to do in
that dimwit, Sammy...

184
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,172
...is to put her up against
nice and stupid guys, like them!

185
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,739
I'm not so sure about this...

186
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,720
Wonder where Misao went?
Thought we'd walk home together.

187
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,754
Sasami!

188
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,026
W-What are you doing
in there, Ryo-Ohki?!

189
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,589
Ha, just thought I'd surprise you...!

190
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,656
Well, you DID!

191
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,104
Anyway, forget about that!
Look at this!

192
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,095
What's with the letter?
"Letter of Challenge"

193
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,605
Just read it!

194
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,141
You already read it, Ryo-Ohki?

195
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,042
You can't go around reading
other people's letters!

196
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,737
Ow...

197
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:55,048
Um... "Sasami Kawai. I've got
your best friend, Misao Amano."

198
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,885
"If you want her back,
tell Pretty Sammy..."

199
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,187
"...to come to the rooftop. Boss."

200
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,454
Aah! Ryo-Ohki! This is...!!!

201
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,423
A cowardly challenge!

202
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,895
They've kidnapped Misao!
I won't stand for it!

203
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,827
- Here, Sasami!
- Mm-hm!

204
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,639
Pretty Mutation...

205
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,007
...Magical Recall!

206
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,418
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

207
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,424
Whose acclaimed transformation
is now complete!

208
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,359
Come on, Sammy! We'll see
which of us is the real man.

209
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,734
Get over here, Sammy!

210
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,296
Then my plan will have
you swimming in tears!

211
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,342
Go down, sun! For my sake!

212
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,377
For my sake!

213
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,517
Misao! I'm coming for you!

214
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,954
You're Pretty Sammy!
I'm Chibiroku, Boss' servant!

215
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,027
Hand Misao back!

216
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,364
Not until after you've fought Boss!

217
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,930
- Yeah?!
- Ha!

218
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,965
Get outta my way!

219
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,702
First, you're gonna fight me
and the rest of the gang!

220
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,710
Why should I?!

221
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,975
It's a preliminary test.
If you can't beat us...

222
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,983
...then you're not good enough
to fight the mighty Boss!

223
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,179
No way! HE'S the one that
challenged me to fight!

224
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,118
You can't tell me what to do!

225
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,156
Enough talk! On guard!

226
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,330
W-What?! What's going on?!

227
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,794
Speed is my specialty!

228
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,769
Come on, Sammy! Come
and get me, if you can!

229
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,761
I can't see him!

230
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,932
- Sammy!
- What is it, Ryo-Ohki?

231
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,470
Oh, yeah!

232
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,788
How come you're not attacking?!
You're just standing there!

233
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,385
This is getting really exhausting!

234
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,752
Huh?!

235
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,799
You should think things through!

236
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,265
Not fair...!

237
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,825
- Hurry, Sammy!
- Yeah!

238
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,478
That's dangerous!

239
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,315
He must be another enemy!

240
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,846
You shouldn't play with knives!

241
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,322
You're gonna get hurt.

242
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,553
Ow! Ow! Ow!

243
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,419
He dropped one.

244
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,158
Never try this at home, kids! Promise!

245
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:53,926
Okay?

246
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,263
Here's your chance!
Finish him off, while you can!

247
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,496
Think I should...?

248
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,196
Huh?

249
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,239
I'll teach you!

250
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,367
See ya! Gotta run!

251
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,469
I'm almost at the rooftop!

252
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,377
You came, Pretty Sammy!

253
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,417
My name's Gariko, and I'm
Boss' devoted servant.

254
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,552
You've made it this far, so
you're as strong as I've heard.

255
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,986
But I've gotten all
the facts on you!

256
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,856
It'll be easy to figure out your
fighting pattern, with my brains!

257
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,917
This is the end of your pursuits!

258
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,963
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry!

259
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,733
Misao!!

260
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,530
Misao!

261
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,697
You came, Pretty Sammy.

262
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,737
Hand over Misao!

263
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,310
Misao...?

264
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,948
What's so funny?

265
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,045
Misa!

266
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:52,284
We tricked you, Sammy!
Boss never did abduct Misao.

267
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,347
What?!

268
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,122
It was just a trap I laid,
for you to fight Boss!

269
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,694
Not fair! That's mean!

270
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,924
You call that a trap?!

271
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,967
He's right.

272
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,468
Say what you will.

273
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,596
Boss, our wait is over!
It's time to fight!

274
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,039
Do your stuff, and knock her
down with one blow!

275
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,401
Been looking forward to
meeting you, Pretty Sammy!

276
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,639
Come and fight me!

277
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:18,376
What's the point?
We have no reason to fight!

278
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,046
Yes, we do! I'm gonna beat you,
and take over the school!

279
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,056
Why are you so stuck
on doing that?!

280
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,820
'Cause I'm Boss!

281
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,384
My fists will do the rest
ofthe talking! Put 'em up!

282
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,064
No!

283
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,007
Don't try to run!
You call yourself a man?!

284
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,310
I'm a GIRL!

285
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,044
Oh!

286
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,407
Now there's no place to run.

287
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,983
Eat this! The Boss Punch!

288
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,887
What?!

289
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,851
I'm falling! I'm gonna die!

290
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,360
What'll I do...?!

291
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,897
Don't give up! No, no, no!

292
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,957
The starting bell for the fight
has only just rung, Boss.

293
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,366
I'll give you incredible power!

294
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:11,960
What?!

295
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,301
Calling Mystics!

296
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,607
- W-What's that?
- A hand...!

297
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,051
WHAT?!! A hand?!
THAT'S a hand?!

298
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,026
BOSS

299
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,488
Ah, this feels great! My body
is overflowing with power!

300
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,960
What on earth are you
thinking, Misa?!

301
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,529
The harmonious union
of magic and delinquents!

302
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,370
I call it
"Gigantic Boss at Dusk!"

303
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,434
Okay, Boss! Squash Sammy!

304
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,139
YO!

305
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,983
- Can't breathe!
- Sammy!

306
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,408
This'll be the final victory!

307
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,512
Rumiya! Get ready for the
celebrations and press interviews!

308
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,557
Is the Juraihelm Hall okay?

309
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,355
Boss!!

310
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,055
Yo, boys!

311
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,461
What happened to your body?!

312
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,728
I got some new power
from her magic!

313
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,099
I'll be able to control
not just the school...

314
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,104
...but the entire world!

315
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:24,006
But before that, I'll celebrate
by crushing Sammy. Just watch!

316
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,845
Nooo!

317
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,540
Huh?!

318
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,508
What, Dosumasa?

319
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,645
Boss! Dosumasa's crying!
And so are the rest of us!

320
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,316
I don't wanna see you
like that, Boss!

321
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,018
Why not? What are you saying?!

322
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,459
You're wrong, Boss!

323
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,496
What do you mean?!

324
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,428
Uh-oh...
What do you mean?!

325
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,395
You used to fight on your own.

326
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,333
You only used your two fists.

327
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,204
That's why we looked up to you,
and stuck by you.

328
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,304
What a weird atmosphere...

329
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:03,538
Using magical powers and becoming
a giant, isn't winning like a real man.

330
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,674
Open your eyes, Boss!

331
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,082
Please!

332
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,246
Oh, guys! Guys!!

333
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,487
Hey, you...!

334
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,219
I'll cancel the hall.

335
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,622
- Are you okay, Sammy?
- Yeah, I think so.

336
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,501
I was wrong!!

337
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,061
- S-Strategic retreat!!
- I thought so!

338
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,404
Converge, magic powers of justice!

339
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:38,776
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

340
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,693
B-Boss...!

341
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,568
Boss!

342
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,207
Pretty Sammy.

343
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,785
W-What...?

344
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,481
I wasn't man enough, either.
I've been a real pain.

345
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,684
That's okay, as long as
you understood.

346
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,718
I lost. You're a real man
among men.

347
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,233
Uh, like I said... I'm a GIRL...

348
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,996
They're waiting for you.

349
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,696
Y-Yeah.

350
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:38,767
Come here.
This may be embarrassing...

351
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,642
...but you've gotta say "thank you."

352
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,249
Bye! See ya!

353
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,686
Sammy. You're dazzling.

354
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:01,096
Um, you know Boss and the others
who transferred here yesterday?

355
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,430
Well, they transferred again.

356
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,766
What?! How come?!

357
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,239
How come, so soon?

358
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,239
Yeah...

359
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,601
And there's a message here
for everyone.

360
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,772
"I've realized that I'm
still pretty immature."

361
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,145
"I've gone away on a journey
once again to train myself..."

362
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,151
"...and I'll return as a real man."

363
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,983
"Sammy, we WILL fight it
out again, as promised!"

364
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,784
And there you have it!

365
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,915
I never made any promises...!

366
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,388
Don't forget our promise, Sammy.

367
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,961
I'm a defeated man.
You don't need to tag along.

368
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,433
Don't say such a thing!

369
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,470
We're sticking together!

370
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,434
Thank you.

371
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,137
Boss...!

372
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,214
Boss!

373
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,250
Wait for us!

374
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,285
We're coming with you!

375
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:20,139
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

376
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:26,443
...but I was wrong.

377
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:34,725
To say there are any number
of guys out there...

378
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,059
...I should've known better.

379
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,590
Midnight,

380
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,029
Comes to anyone,

381
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:52,403
...not only to Cinderella.

382
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:58,905
It may be too late, saying this
after such a long time...

383
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:05,815
...but I've made light
of the whole world.

384
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:13,730
To think that somehow things
would turn out all right...

385
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,429
...I should've known better.

386
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,775
Misa uses her magic
to turn Sammy into a baby!

387
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,375
A Domain Crystal from the Star
Omega is needed to turn her back!

388
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,750
But where do you find that?!

389
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,880
Coming next: Baby Sammy.

390
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,958
Count on Sammy, when
you've got troubles!
