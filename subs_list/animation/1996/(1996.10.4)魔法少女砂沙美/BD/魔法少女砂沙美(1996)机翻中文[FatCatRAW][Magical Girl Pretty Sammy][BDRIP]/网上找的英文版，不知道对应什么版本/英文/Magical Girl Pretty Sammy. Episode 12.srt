1
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:14,152
I should be able to do anything...

2
00:00:14,152 --> 00:00:17,087
...with all the things around me.

3
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:20,482
I just have to use my head...

4
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:23,551
...and the incantation.

5
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:32,796
If I get hungry...

6
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:35,139
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

7
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,610
...and the noodle shop...

8
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:43,444
...will make a speedy delivery.

9
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:47,486
When I get sleepy...

10
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:50,114
...I flop out.

11
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:54,292
If I lie down a while...

12
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:56,055
...I'll be feeling fine...

13
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:00,866
...by the next morning.

14
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:04,469
You have it in you, too.

15
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:07,233
This mysterious power.

16
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:11,064
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,411
...is more than just a dream.

18
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,675
Wow!

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,773
- Gee! It's beautiful!
- It sure is!

20
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,049
Ow!

21
00:01:58,123 --> 00:01:59,556
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

22
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:01,148
Uh, yeah!

23
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:04,889
Don't move.

24
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:06,430
Oh!

25
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,124
I'm sorry. I wasn't
paying attention.

26
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,227
No, I was looking up
at the trees...

27
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:14,203
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:16,137
We were doing the same thing.

29
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,437
Looking at the beautiful light
filtering through the trees.

30
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:21,371
Yeah!

31
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:33,914
The Blue Sky Rangers

32
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:37,124
Oh, thanks so much for taking
the trouble to bring her home.

33
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,359
Mr. Tenchi Masaki, was it?

34
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:41,228
Yes.

35
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,028
There!

36
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,831
You're lucky you bumped
into such a good, young man.

37
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:50,173
If this were a girl's comic,
it'd be such a passionate scene!

38
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,876
Did you feel the passion?

39
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,036
Huh?

40
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:56,080
Gee whiz, Mom!

41
00:02:58,516 --> 00:02:59,784
When I first met Ginji...

42
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:01,115
Uh, excuse me?

43
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,076
Yes?

44
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:04,781
How's the sales status of this?

45
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:09,184
The Blue Sky Cool Rangers,
huh? I love 'em!

46
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,691
Uh, that's not what I meant...

47
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:16,131
They're really popular with boys.
The CDs are selling okay here.

48
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,793
Do you like that kind of thing?

49
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:21,229
I'm the assistant director
of the show.

50
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,772
Assistant director...?

51
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:24,775
He makes the shows.

52
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:26,708
Yeah?! That's great!!

53
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:31,640
Thanks. Actually, I'm gonna
be allowed to direct soon.

54
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:34,184
So now I'm really concerned
about how popular it is.

55
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:38,852
I've never watched it before,
but I'm gonna start this week!

56
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:40,686
Um, good luck!

57
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,853
I'm sure you'll be able to
film a really good movie!

58
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:45,889
Thank you.

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,772
The Blue Sky Cool Rangers

60
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:01,243
The Blue Sky Cool Rangers

61
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,438
Cool Red!

62
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:05,745
- Green!
- Pink!
- Yellow!
- Black!

63
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:09,115
Cool Rangers!

64
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,155
Oh, yeah! This opening...

65
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:17,490
...gets your blood pumping every time!
Isn't that right, Honoka?

66
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:21,896
It's made your blood pump for
over 20 years now, right, Ginji?

67
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:24,696
What? This has been
on for that long?

68
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,670
Yes. It started with the
Five Secret Ninja Rangers.

69
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,139
They kept making them, with
the ideas changing every time.

70
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,506
It's one of Japan's legendary
programs, if you ask me.

71
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:37,305
And Ginji was disguised
as the bad guy, Red Nose...

72
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:39,316
...in the Ninjas.

73
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:42,649
And the way he was beaten up,
I absolutely melted!

74
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,188
Really?

75
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,817
That was a long time ago.

76
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:50,958
So that man's creating one of
Japan's legendary programs!

77
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,472
What are you reading, Sasami?

78
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:06,176
The Blue Sky Cool Rangers
Encyclopedia...?

79
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:10,340
Yeah, I highly recommend it!
It's a legendary Japanese program!

80
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:14,351
Yeah, right. Legendary
Japanese program, huh?

81
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,649
That show's for kindergarten kids.

82
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:18,254
That's not true!

83
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,951
People work hard
to create that show!

84
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:23,390
What are you reading?

85
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:26,330
It's the Cool Rangers!

86
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:29,590
I love Cool Red!
He's sooo cool!

87
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:31,765
Then I'll be Cool Pink!

88
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,004
Get away from me, freak!

89
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:36,836
But why'd you go and buy
a book like this, suddenly?

90
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:38,671
Uh...

91
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:42,474
Well it was interesting, and the
people who make it are really nice!

92
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:44,975
The people who make it?

93
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,419
All right!

94
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,386
Cool Rangers
Scene 12, Cut 61

95
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,227
We're going into the climax!

96
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:01,889
And, cut!

97
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,583
Wonder where Tenchi is...?

98
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,045
Editing Room

99
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,023
- Oops.
- I'm sorry!

100
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,650
You an actor?
This is the editing room.

101
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:31,320
No, I'm Sasami. I'm looking
for Tenchi, the director...

102
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,956
...I mean, for Mr. Masaki.

103
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:37,096
He ordered a CD from our
shop, and it's arrived.

104
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:41,328
Tenchi's probably reading
in the staff room.

105
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,265
Reading...?

106
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:48,005
Everyone reads the script,
and gives their input.

107
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:53,380
Want me to give that to him?

108
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,749
I'm sure he's forgotten
to pick it up.

109
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,685
He's so zoned out.

110
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:00,383
No, thanks! I'll take it myself!

111
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,321
Oh? Then...

112
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:05,191
Go out there and turn right.

113
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:07,424
Turn left right away, and the
staff room's in the middle building.

114
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,489
You'll see the poster.

115
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,535
Thank you very much, ma'am.

116
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:18,131
He couldn't have forgotten!
Tenchi told me, personally!

117
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,137
Oh, so you found that CD?

118
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:22,343
Yes!

119
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:25,109
That's wonderful! I've been
looking for it, for ages!

120
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,310
I'll be there that morning,
to pick it up.

121
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:29,353
Okay! I'll be waiting!

122
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:32,785
I'm afraid that's impossible,
little girl.

123
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:35,553
The director's still a long way
from finishing up.

124
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,986
Why don't you let me
take it for him?

125
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,490
No, thanks. Anyway, there's
the money to figure out, too.

126
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:42,726
Um, could I wait for him?

127
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:47,596
Well, sometimes he works
until late at night.

128
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:50,099
I think you'd better leave
it for tomorrow.

129
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,043
I see...

130
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:57,538
I could see this episode
as a romantic action.

131
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,640
But if you change it your way...

132
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:02,811
...the script's warmth
will be completely ruined!

133
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,678
I'd like to try it my way!

134
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:08,423
I'm begging you!
Please let me handle it!

135
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:10,120
Please!

136
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:25,468
A giant hippo showed up in the town.

137
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,602
Everyone panicked!

138
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,204
Even the policeman was panicky!

139
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,220
What am I doing?!

140
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,586
Sorry to keep you, Sasami.

141
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:48,996
Sorry, Misao, but I've got
to deliver something today, too.

142
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:50,594
Oh, I see.

143
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,568
Sorry. See you tomorrow!

144
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:53,865
Uh-huh.

145
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,834
Sasami...

146
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:02,209
I've gotta get the CD
to him today!

147
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,747
Oh!

148
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,043
Tenchi!

149
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,979
Huh?

150
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,052
I finally found you!

151
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,464
Hi, Sasami.

152
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,567
Is something wrong?

153
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,432
Is that what it looks like?

154
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:28,131
Kind of.

155
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,435
I see.

156
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:35,408
But if you change it your way, the
script's warmth will be completely ruined!

157
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,448
Tenchi. Impact is what's
important in visual arts.

158
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,644
If you don't have that,
you don't get the ratings.

159
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,084
Don't you understand that?

160
00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:45,281
- But...
- Change it!

161
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:49,920
Sasami... you know, I...

162
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:52,428
Yes, what is it?

163
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:55,898
Nothing. Forget it, it's
just boring adult stuff.

164
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,026
I'd be glad to listen.

165
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:03,471
It's really nothing for you
to worry about, Sasami.

166
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,254
Adult stuff, huh...

167
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:29,657
I'm just a kid. I've got
a long way to go. Yeah.

168
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,268
Got a problem, huh, Sasami?

169
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:42,472
If you've got a problem,
we've all got a problem.

170
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:44,014
Come on, tell us.

171
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,674
Mom, Dad...

172
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,277
Um, when am I
gonna become an adult?

173
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:53,281
You're already quite the
wonderful lady, you know.

174
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:54,219
Oh?

175
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:55,759
That's right, Sasami.

176
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:59,558
Wanting to become an adult is
the first step to becoming one.

177
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,027
"The first step to becoming one...?"

178
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,034
So just be Sasami.
Be as Sasami as you can.

179
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:09,734
And then, before you know it
you'll be a wonderful adult.

180
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:12,332
So just be the same as always.

181
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,675
I see. Yeah, you're right!

182
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:18,044
I'll just be myself,
and keep on going!

183
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:20,016
Thanks, Dad!

184
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:22,314
Night, Mom.

185
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:25,222
Let's go, Ryo-Ohki.

186
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,048
What a girl.

187
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:31,357
What are you saying, Ginji? All girls
go through this sooner or later.

188
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,663
Did you, too?

189
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:35,323
That's a secret.

190
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,256
What a girl.

191
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:41,068
I'm gonna tell him tomorrow!
I'll go tell him to do his best!

192
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,644
Sasami...

193
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:50,538
Hello...!

194
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:52,583
Stage number 8!

195
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,746
Number 8... number 8...

196
00:11:58,689 --> 00:11:59,747
Oh! There it is!

197
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,451
Um...

198
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:06,261
Come to watch? I don't
think you'll be allowed.

199
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:07,186
What?

200
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:10,063
He's so lame, I'm just amazed!

201
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:12,102
Huh, I knew it, though.

202
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,768
So Sasami's been coming
here to play.

203
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,712
How come she didn't tell me?

204
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:23,910
Maybe she doesn't like me anymore...

205
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,311
What?!

206
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:38,052
Why do you keep telling
me to redo it?!

207
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:42,455
I was told all I had to do
was come out and ad-lib!

208
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:46,564
I thought we'd get a better
performance if we stuck it out!

209
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,605
That's why I asked for
all the retakes!

210
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,806
Looks like the shoot's
off, Mr. Masaki.

211
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:56,813
It's good to be sincere, but that alone
doesn't cut it, for a director.

212
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,020
Boy, what a terrible situation.

213
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:09,359
Pretty Mutation...

214
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:12,094
...Magical Recall!

215
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,604
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

216
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,450
Tenchi?

217
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:35,979
Who're you?

218
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:38,248
Count on Sammy,
for shooting a scene!

219
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:40,449
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

220
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,884
I'll come,
even if you don't call!

221
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:46,128
Pretty Sammy...!
You're really her?

222
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:50,561
Yes! Tenchi! Please let
me play that last part!

223
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:55,533
I might not be as good as that
last actor, but I'll do my best!

224
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,676
Okay, let's do it!

225
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:09,782
Hey, that's not bad.

226
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:11,845
If Magical Girl Pretty Sammy
appears in our show...

227
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,822
...we'll be the talk of the industry!

228
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:15,882
Our ratings will skyrocket!

229
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:19,055
Masaki is a fluky genius of some sort!

230
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:24,832
Mistress Misa. Shouldn't we be
messing up their shoot?

231
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:28,770
No, no! My target is that
wretched Pretty Sammy!

232
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,331
We'll wait till they get to the
climax, before we stomp on her.

233
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,379
That'll double her shock.
Then we'll clobber Sammy...

234
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:38,779
...while she's reeling
from the mental impact.

235
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,817
What a plan, Mistress Misa!

236
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:44,850
We'll attack while they shoot
the climax scene, number 18.

237
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:49,325
Cut! Quiet, up there!

238
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:51,295
Oh, sorry!

239
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:52,319
Cool Rangers
Scene 18, Cut 673

240
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:55,932
No use! It's a dead end!

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,968
Darn! If only we could use
the Cool Ranger robot!

242
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,600
What should we do?!

243
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,071
I'll...!

244
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:06,268
Cut! What's the matter, Sammy?

245
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:08,038
I'm sorry!

246
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:10,945
Your line is, "I'll be a decoy."

247
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:15,179
"I'll sacrifice myself,
if it'll save the rest of you."

248
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:16,184
Okay?

249
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,777
Um...

250
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:18,787
What is it?

251
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,824
That's okay. I'll give it a shot.

252
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:24,726
All right, here we go.
Scene 18, Cut 673.

253
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:26,956
Take 6.
Ready, and action!

254
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:29,932
No use! It's a dead end!

255
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,968
Darn! If only we could use
the Cool Ranger robot!

256
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:34,598
What should we do?!

257
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,841
I'll be...

258
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,777
Sammy! Your line!

259
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:44,374
Cut!!

260
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,915
What's your problem, Sammy?

261
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:48,485
What's gotten into you all?!

262
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:49,683
W-What the...?!

263
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:53,846
A Love-love Monster!

264
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:56,825
Bulls-eye! You missed your
chance in the spotlight, Sammy.

265
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:58,862
What a pity.

266
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,061
Sammy! It's Pixy Misa!

267
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,327
Misa! What're you gonna do?!

268
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:07,303
Of course I'm gonna
completely total this set!

269
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:09,271
I won't let you do that!

270
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,767
Let's see you try and stop me!

271
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,142
Special Effects Girl!
Total the place!!

272
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,318
Please stop! Don't destroy the set!

273
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,354
My budget...! My budget...!

274
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:28,791
That suits you people.

275
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,794
They're just costumes at first,
but later...

276
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:36,026
...they'll turn your hearts
and bodies into real monsters.

277
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:43,039
- Pink!!
- Red!!

278
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:49,708
Poor Tenchi!
Turn everybody back!

279
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:51,948
I'll think about it...

280
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:55,679
...if you'll sacrifice
yourself for everyone.

281
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,510
Me...?

282
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,078
Yes!

283
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,516
Don't do it, Sammy!

284
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:04,959
Say it, Sammy!

285
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,497
The line you were about
to deliver in the drama!

286
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,199
I'll be a decoy.

287
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:14,904
I'll sacrifice myself,
if it'll save the rest of you.

288
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:18,942
But... but...!!

289
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:19,934
What?

290
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,308
I don't want to do that!!

291
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,914
Oh, that's so unfair, Sammy!

292
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:29,509
The heroine's supposed to sacrifice
herself for everyone, here!

293
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:32,351
I don't want to do that!
Because I... I...

294
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:34,891
I work together with everyone!!

295
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,916
Special Effects Girl.

296
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:40,088
Become a decoy for me, and
sacrifice yourself for me, okay?

297
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:47,698
Converge, magic powers of justice!

298
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:57,247
Pretty...Coquettish...Bomber!

299
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,780
The bad monster ALWAYS
gets it in the end!!

300
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,728
M-My budget...

301
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,424
What happened...?

302
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:20,395
Tenchi!
Can I change that line?

303
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:21,495
Huh?

304
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:25,473
To "I'll try my best,
and you all do the same!"

305
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,168
Okay, let's go with that!

306
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,951
Then Tenchi rewrote the script...

307
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:38,120
...and had it so that I fought
together with the Cool Rangers.

308
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,156
It was a great story!

309
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:43,023
It was hard work,
but a lot of fun!

310
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,759
It really was a lot of fun!

311
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,067
But...

312
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:58,973
Hello. Oh, Mr. Masaki!
Just a minute, please.

313
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,601
Sasami! There's a call for you!

314
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:02,646
All right! Hello?

315
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:06,811
...Oh, hi! Yes. Yes.

316
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:08,512
What?!!

317
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,679
What's wrong, Sasami?
Answer me!

318
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:18,886
Oh, hi, Sasami!

319
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:22,632
Tenchi, are you
really going to move?!

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,991
Yeah, there was a fuss
raised the other day...

321
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,196
...about changing that
Cool Rangers story.

322
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:30,572
I'll be working on
a set in Kyoto.

323
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:34,544
No! But it was such
a great story...!

324
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:39,072
Yeah. It's rare to get fired
for making a good show.

325
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:40,047
Oh...

326
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:43,518
That's all right, Kei. It just happened
that a director who saw the show...

327
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:46,681
...wants to use me as a
theatrical director.

328
00:19:46,757 --> 00:19:49,487
Really. I don't know
if that's lucky or not.

329
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,190
- Is this the last of your things?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:55,665
Thanks, Sasami.

331
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,600
If you ever see Sammy again,
could you pass this on for me?

332
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,637
Tell her it was fun.

333
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,763
Sure. I bet she probably
had fun, too.

334
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,536
Yeah.

335
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:10,947
Good-bye, Sasami!

336
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,719
Good-bye!!

337
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:19,155
Oh, why...?!

338
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:24,285
- Sasami.
- Misao.

339
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:27,063
Sorry to show up like this.

340
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:31,568
Um, I asked your mom, and she
said you were headed over here.

341
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:33,102
So...

342
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,797
Misao!

343
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:38,805
Sasami!

344
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:43,439
I don't know why, but I cried
so hard, I couldn't stop.

345
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:45,304
Oh, boy.

346
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,475
And it wasn't until much later...

347
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:51,612
...that I started to think that
maybe this is what love felt like.

348
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:55,282
A long, long time later.

349
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:07,463
Once again, the girl you're watching...

350
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:12,798
...isn't the real me.

351
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,715
It's a girl...

352
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:22,183
...that was made up...

353
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,681
...for you and for our love.

354
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:36,691
You like my honesty.

355
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:42,266
That's what you say...

356
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,603
...but it's an illusion.

357
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,746
Deceiving others is a way of life.

358
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,708
It's a woman's romance.

359
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:57,050
I love you more than anyone.

360
00:21:57,588 --> 00:22:01,115
I want to show you
a wonderful dream.

361
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:04,422
I love you so much.

362
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm going to keep deceiving you.

363
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:12,028
I'll make you happier...

364
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:18,864
...than any other guy in the world.

365
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:28,341
Miss Kiyone's going to meet
someone for an arranged marriage.

366
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:30,750
Miss Mihoshi is excited and
tries to make the meeting work!

367
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:33,255
All right! Sammy's gonna
do her best, too!

368
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:35,450
Coming next: All I Want is You.

369
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:40,429
An engagement ring worth
3 months' salary is appropriate!
