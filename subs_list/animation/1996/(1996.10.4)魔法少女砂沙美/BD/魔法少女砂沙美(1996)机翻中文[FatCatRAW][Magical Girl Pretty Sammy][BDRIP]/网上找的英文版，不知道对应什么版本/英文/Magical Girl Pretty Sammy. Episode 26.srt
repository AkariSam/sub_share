00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:14,449
Nandemo dekiru hazu dawa...

2
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:17,316
...soko ni aru mono de.

3
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:20,849
Juumon to atama ga...

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,824
...tsukai you!

5
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,094
Onaka ga sukeba...

6
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,436
...juumon wa PIPOPA.

7
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:39,907
Suguni osobaya-san ga...

8
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:43,741
...demae ni yatte kuruwa.

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,783
Nemuku nattara...

10
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,411
...battan no juuten.

11
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:54,556
Yoko ni nareba...

12
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,319
...asa niwa...

13
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,163
...genki ni nareruwa.

14
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:04,733
Kimi nimo kanarazu aruwa.

15
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,497
Fushigi na chikara ga.

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,203
Yume mireba yume mo...

17
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:14,667
...yume janai.

18
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,294
The Earth is now inside the
sun's gravitational field...

19
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,832
...and its speed has accelerated!

20
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,425
Johnny! We've only got
two hours left!

21
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,367
Humanity's last resort...

22
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:45,531
...is the NT System and
the two magical girls!

23
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,500
- No problem, Catherine!
- Huh?

24
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:51,370
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy is...

25
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:54,347
...my daughter is...
...she's no fool!

26
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:59,376
Magical Victory!

27
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,617
Welcome, Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.

28
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,585
Or rather, my cute little sister.

29
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:07,519
I'm your little sister?!

30
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,996
That's right!
I'm sure you don't remember...

31
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:13,663
...but you went floating down
a magic river when you were a baby...

32
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:17,068
...and you were discovered
by a human couple passing by.

33
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:22,204
And to prove it, your hair is blue!

34
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,279
Bingo.

35
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,575
So are you really...

36
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:35,082
Are you really my...
BIG SISTER?!

37
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,182
You idiot!

38
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,961
How could you fall
for such a big joke?!

39
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:44,359
Very impressive,
Magical Girl Pixy Misa.

40
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:47,925
You saw right through
my little white lie.

41
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:50,494
That's mean! You tricked me!!

42
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:52,062
That's your fault.

43
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,540
Hm, that really is a shame.

44
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,103
Now I have no choice
but to destroy you all.

45
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:02,314
Enough talk! Just put the Earth
back where it's supposed to be!

46
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:05,042
I won't! Not ever!

47
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:09,251
You were a candidate to be queen!
Why are you doing this?

48
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,449
Well, as a matter of fact...

49
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,758
There's no time to listen
to your excuses!

50
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:25,201
Misa!

51
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,904
- That's...?!
- An M Field...?

52
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:31,912
Don't you understand? Conduct
such as that of the earthlings...

53
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:34,639
...makes me turn to destruction.

54
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,417
They depend on civilization
and cause nature to suffer.

55
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,078
They're killing the planet.

56
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:42,590
There can't be any benefit to
the survival of such beings.

57
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:44,582
But remember what Tsunami said!

58
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,628
She said that the Earth and
Juraihelm were one, originally!

59
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:50,426
Precisely. However,
they split in two...

60
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:54,299
...and the evil part of civilization
went to the humans.

61
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:58,468
No matter how hard I tried
as a magical girl...

62
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,770
...I couldn't stop the conflict.

63
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:02,434
You're a magical girl?

64
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:06,145
It's the sad truth
of the ancient past.

65
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,205
You mean, you're a human?!

66
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,175
Yes. I'm human, and that's
why I can understand.

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,917
The Earth is infecting
our peaceful Juraihelm with its evil.

68
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,515
I must put a stop to that,
if nothing else!

69
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,025
That's not true!

70
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:22,461
Sure, we'll have arguments,
but we can get closer!

71
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,665
That's what everyone on Earth thinks!

72
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,702
That's childish logic!

73
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,831
My logic tells me there's no
choice but to destroy the Earth!

74
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,374
My mom told me something
when I was in grade two.

75
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:39,938
There's no choice but to spank
a child who won't listen!!

76
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:46,652
No, Sammy! We've gotta destroy
the NT System on this ship!

77
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,487
If we do that, everyone will
be able to use their magic!

78
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:50,547
Okay!

79
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,593
Not so fast, girlie!

80
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,221
Leave her to me! You go
bust that system, Sammy!

81
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,961
Thanks, Misa!

82
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:02,026
Impatient girl...

83
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:06,667
You won't get in so easily!
The door's locked!

84
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,512
I told you! Earthlings must...!

85
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:19,220
You won't destroy the Earth!

86
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:24,448
What are you opposing me for?!
You're not even a human!!

87
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,684
Because there's a girl I love
living on that planet!!

88
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,698
Oh, Rumiya... how bold!

89
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,425
Hey?! Hey?! Hey?!

90
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,436
- Which way, Ryo-Ohki?
- Maybe this way!

91
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,478
No, no, no!

92
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,249
Mistress Ramia!

93
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,879
Sammy! Romio's strange switch...

94
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,887
...is up ahead.

95
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,513
Hang in there!

96
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,353
Just go!

97
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,325
GO AND DESTROY THAT THING!!!

98
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:01,218
Thanks, lady!

99
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,264
"Thanks", she says.

100
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:07,096
Sammy doesn't have a clue
what's been going on all along.

101
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:12,603
Romio! Just see what happens
when you make me angry!!

102
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:17,411
I'm definitely, definitely
gonna make you bawl!!

103
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,743
Pixy Lovely Fire!

104
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,510
Give up. It won't work.

105
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,317
Sammy! Hurry and do your stuff!

106
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,328
Can she really do that?

107
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,125
"Put something away
for a rainy day."

108
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:39,634
I've made a device
on the NT System.

109
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:42,169
There's no way the magical
girl can destroy it.

110
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:45,604
That'th not twue!
Thammy can be bery dangewous...

111
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,142
...when she wants!

112
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,793
There it is, the NT System!

113
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,196
Okay!

114
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,259
Sammy!

115
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:14,962
Wh-What happened?

116
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,961
It's a powerful barrier!
There's no way to get in!

117
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,874
I'll get in shomehow...
Dis won't shtop me!

118
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,638
NT System, initiate!

119
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:28,046
Full Power, Pretty Attack!!

120
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,249
Go for it, Sammy!

121
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:37,257
I will! I can't lose!

122
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:40,654
Because I... I...

123
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,193
I am a magical girl
who fights for justice!!

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,290
Destroy it!

125
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:48,893
Gotcha!

126
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,767
- Oops.
- Outta energy!

127
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,101
No way!!

128
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:55,700
But I've made it all
this way! Please work!

129
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,243
What'll I do?! What'll I do?!
The Earth's gonna sink into the sun!

130
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:01,441
Everyone's gonna be in big trouble!

131
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,215
In that case...

132
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:08,950
Why, you...!

133
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,458
You stupid thing!
Stupid, stupid thing!

134
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:13,892
Stupid, stupid thing!
Stupid, stupid thing!

135
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,301
I can't break it.

136
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:24,128
You can't give up!
Try, for everyone's sake!

137
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:30,768
BREAK!!

138
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,812
- BREAK!!
- BREAK!!

139
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,916
The baton!!

140
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,249
What?!

141
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,958
Hooray!

142
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:48,385
Mistress Tsunami.
Our magic is returning.

143
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,488
Sammy did it!

144
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,760
No! She couldn't have
broken the barrier!

145
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,072
Are you okay, Misa?!

146
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,803
I may or may not have
been affected by all this.

147
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:06,175
Thank you, Sammy! Now
everyone can use their magic!

148
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,147
We'll see about that.

149
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:12,209
You've destroyed the NT System,
but you're still out of luck.

150
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:16,255
The magical cannons are still
charged with lots of energy.

151
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:17,086
What?!

152
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:20,093
And the target, of course...
...is the Earth!

153
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:24,730
It cannot be stopped!
This is the end for the Earth!

154
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,266
But we've made it this far...!

155
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:29,360
I won't give up!
I'm not giving up!!

156
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:31,395
I'll never give up!

157
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,373
Course you won't, Sammy!

158
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:36,171
Magical girls never give up!!

159
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,850
We're definitely
gonna stop that thing!!

160
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,511
We'll show you the powers
of a magical girl!

161
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,186
Whoah! It's huge!

162
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,457
Feels like we're up against
something invincible...

163
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,358
Magical cannon, fire!

164
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:58,024
- Here it comes, Sammy!
- Right!

165
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,351
That's ridiculous!
That can't possibly be!

166
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:29,823
Everyone lent us their strength!

167
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:31,263
They prayed for us!

168
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,778
My beloved Sammy...

169
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,951
I can see you all.

170
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,313
Everybody's wishing...

171
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:56,090
...for peace in the universe!

172
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:58,484
Converge, magic powers of wishes!

173
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,295
What's that light?

174
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,662
The light of everyone's hearts!

175
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,804
Magic and science
have completely fused!

176
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,709
That light... It's the future
that Juraihelm and Earth...

177
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,747
...should proceed toward!

178
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,472
I won't stand for this!
The Earth is tainted by evil.

179
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:25,178
- Sammy!
- Romio!

180
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:27,819
I'll make you bawl!
No matter what!

181
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,316
Why are you coming this way?!

182
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,359
Get ready!

183
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:34,689
Got it!

184
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:38,496
Hooray!

185
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,625
- Pretty...
- Lovely...

186
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:44,334
...Final Coquettish Bomber!!

187
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,769
My baton...!

188
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:54,548
Please, magical baton!
Please hang in there!

189
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,584
For everyone's sake!

190
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:58,545
Please!

191
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:00,585
It's no use...

192
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:01,986
Don't worry.

193
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,080
Huh?

194
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,933
Thank you, magical baton.

195
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:17,028
I tried my very best...

196
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,473
I protected everyone, right...?

197
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,148
Mistress Tsunami.
The Earth was saved.

198
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,548
And Juraihelm is
no longer in danger.

199
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,087
But Sammy...

200
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,646
Sammy...

201
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,251
- Sasami!!
- Misao!!

202
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,124
Sasami is...!

203
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,459
Misao!

204
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:45,556
Sasami is...!

205
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,767
Misao!

206
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,802
They're gone!

207
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:51,338
Shouldn't give up so soon.

208
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,173
Sasami! Sasami!

209
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,010
M-Misao...

210
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:06,144
You came to. I'm so glad.

211
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,687
What's happened to us?

212
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,059
Looks like a magical recoil
sent us into outer space.

213
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:16,629
The M Field is still working,
but the energy's running out.

214
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:20,996
I'm sorry, Misao.

215
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:23,902
You came to help me, and this
is what ended up happening.

216
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:26,035
You mustn't apologize.

217
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:29,235
I'm happy I could be
a help to everyone.

218
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,937
Yeah, so am I.

219
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:33,276
I'm happy just being with you.

220
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:37,284
But now you'll never
realize your dream...

221
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:39,650
...of becoming a pianist.

222
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:42,121
No, that's not true.

223
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,581
Sasami, I have a favor to ask.

224
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:48,560
Would you listen to my
very first performance?

225
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,598
Sure!

226
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,225
Even beautiful scenery...

227
00:13:56,738 --> 00:14:00,970
Even a beautiful flower...

228
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:05,707
Is meaningless...

229
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,016
...when you see it alone.

230
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:14,712
Because there's a friend who laughs...

231
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:19,422
And cries with you...

232
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:24,788
Because they are your friend...

233
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:30,066
That's what makes it enjoyable.

234
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,835
No matter how lonely the night is...

235
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,943
Just a simple "thank you"...

236
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:43,682
Huh?

237
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,082
What is it?

238
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,415
Look!

239
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,079
Look, Sasami!

240
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:49,623
Wha...?

241
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:51,257
It's a magic...

242
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,020
A magic light!!

243
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,722
R-Ryo-Ohki?

244
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,161
Sasami?

245
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,494
- Ryo-Ohki!
- Rumiya!

246
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,535
Misao!

247
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:05,362
I'm so glad you're safe.

248
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,668
Tsunami! What about Earth?!
What happened?

249
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,180
Is everyone okay?!

250
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,977
See for yourself.

251
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:26,688
Yo!

252
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,423
- Dad!
- Professor Washu, too!

253
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:33,166
Sasami! Let's all have sukiyaki
when we get home!

254
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:36,101
Hooray!
Sukiyaki! A party!

255
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,970
Sukiyaki! Your favorite, Ryo-Ohki!
Great, huh?!

256
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,734
Ryo-Ohki...?

257
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:46,041
We have to say good-bye, Sasami.

258
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,213
How come? Aren't
you coming with me?

259
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,047
I'm from the magical world.

260
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:55,189
You aren't coming, either?

261
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:56,188
No...

262
00:15:56,257 --> 00:16:00,557
Stop kidding. You're coming
with me to Earth, right?

263
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,262
You'll live with me forever, right?

264
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:05,299
I'm sorry, Sasami.

265
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,928
That's not fair! I thought
we'd be together!

266
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:13,670
That's what I thought.

267
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:18,033
I wanna be with you, Ryo-Ohki!

268
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:27,277
Sasami. When the people of Juraihelm
and Earth can understand one another...

269
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:29,323
...I'll come to see you!

270
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,815
Really?

271
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,861
I promise.

272
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,757
Transform into birdie,
and come visit me again.

273
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,738
I will go! Because I...

274
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,966
Uh... I like...

275
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:51,274
I, uh... like...

276
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,347
Out with it!!

277
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,317
S-Sis!

278
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:37,552
Several months later

279
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,287
- I'm off!
- Have a good day!

280
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,796
All kinds of things
happened after that.

281
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,695
Tsunami had her ascension
ceremony as queen.

282
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:51,165
Leaders of Juraihelm and Earth
met to have discussions.

283
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:54,875
And little by little, everyone
learned how to use magic.

284
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,671
The day is fast approaching
when the people of Earth...

285
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,577
...and Juraihelm will get along.

286
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:03,014
I'll be able to see
Ryo-Ohki and Tsunami again!

287
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:05,545
I'll definitely see them again!

288
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,545
Listen up, boys and girls.

289
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:15,494
After spring vacation is over,
you'll be in a new room, and a new grade.

290
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:18,430
You've all been such good children.

291
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,467
And the Earth has been saved.

292
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,002
I feel so... I feel so...

293
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:26,539
She's crying again.

294
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,132
How many months does
she think has passed?

295
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,508
Right, Hiroto?
Yeah, you're right.

296
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,014
Lovebirds!

297
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:33,881
Next Class Leader

298
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,314
Love Me Eimi!

299
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,908
Keep it down!!

300
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,318
Why can't you keep it down
on the last day of classes?!

301
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:43,924
- Oh, my...
- What, now?!

302
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,527
Sasami!

303
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:48,789
Ryo-Ohki!

304
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:50,922
You kept your promise!

305
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,057
This is no time for that!!

306
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,567
Huh?

307
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,603
T-Tsunami!

308
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:01,134
Something awful has happened.

309
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:05,274
But the world became peaceful,
thanks to Sammy. Right?

310
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,173
Yeah! Juraihelm and Earth
became peaceful.

311
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,410
So what's wrong?

312
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,542
It's Mars.

313
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,314
Mars?!!

314
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,217
Here. Your brand new magic baton.

315
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,618
Use this to transform into
New Pretty Sammy!

316
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,488
We can't talk about that HERE!!

317
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:32,197
I KNEW IT!!!

318
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,371
Sasami and Sammy sound alike.

319
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,411
Your hair and faces are identical!

320
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,441
And personalities, too!

321
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,413
I knew all along, of course!

322
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:43,780
We thought we were supposed
to keep quiet about it!

323
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:48,214
Kawai! Use your magic to turn
me back to normal!

324
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,457
Your secret's out, Sasami.

325
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:54,084
Come on, Sasami! Transform
into Pretty Sammy!

326
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:55,617
Right!

327
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:58,563
I'm counting on your help again.

328
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,501
Leave it to me!

329
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:21,822
I should be able to do anything...

330
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,723
...with all the things around me.

331
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,323
I just have to use my head...

332
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,287
...and the incantation.

333
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,631
If I get hungry...

334
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,067
...my incantation is "Pipopa"...

335
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,111
Pipopa!

336
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,308
...and the noodle shop...

337
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:51,507
...will make a speedy delivery.

338
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,456
When I get sleepy...

339
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:56,980
...I flop out.

340
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:58,218
Flop out!

341
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,096
If I lie down a while...

342
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:04,155
...I'll be feeling fine...

343
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,636
...by the next morning.

344
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:12,373
You have it in you, too.

345
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:15,206
This mysterious power.

346
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:18,773
If you have a dream,
then even a dream...

347
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:22,240
...is more than just a dream.

348
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:44,969
Mars

349
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,404
Magic power to increase
our strength!

350
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:55,805
The Earth belongs to us Martians!

351
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:04,749
I haven't given up at all!

352
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,486
- Stop it!
- Who's that?

353
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:09,524
Leave it to Sammy, when
it comes to magical incidents!

354
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:12,559
Magical Girl Pretty Sammy!

355
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,625
I'll come, whether or not you call!
