1
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:05,708
There's no one in the village...

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:09,375
My goodness, Mr. Alvin is so unpopular.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,208
No matter how unpopular I am,
it won't make the whole village disappear.

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:16,375
They should've run away
because they knew you were coming.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,292
If they knew I'd come,

6
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,750
they would line up to shake hands with me.

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,542
Celia, it's all right.

8
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:26,083
The dwarfs will be rescued.

9
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:30,083
The dwarfs don't get along well with us.

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,917
Is there any misunderstanding
between elves and dwarfs?

11
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:39,292
Yes, I failed to bargain
in the dwarfs' clothing store before.

12
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:42,833
It's your personal problem!
It has nothing to do with race!

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,750
I walked around. There's no one in the village.

14
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,000
Me too. It looks like they were taken away.

15
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,042
I see.

16
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:54,417
Just in case,
I'll see if the wounded are hiding.

17
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,417
You can use that magic?

18
00:00:56,542 --> 00:01:00,625
I'm a healer. I can find the weak.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,292
You're a monster that targets the wounded.

20
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,708
Holy power.

21
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,167
Please save those who have been abandoned
because of injury.

22
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:13,875
Please show where the poor and weak are.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,750
You look like a real healer.

24
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,000
How ugly.

25
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,750
Go and find it.

26
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,750
If there's really a weak person,
we have to help him.

27
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:26,542
There's a response around here.

28
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,708
And he's very weak!

29
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,958
What? Where is it?

30
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,750
I'm not weak.

31
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,375
I'm sorry. You're weak.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,917
But my body is strong!

33
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:46,042
But we can't save them
if we don't know where they were taken.

34
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,958
-That's right.
-Celia heard it!

35
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,917
The bad people took everyone to the castle cell.

36
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,250
Right there!

37
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,958
It's like a bad person's favourite place.

38
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,875
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,208
"THE TITLE" "FINALLY, IT COMES TO THE LAST EPISODE.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING TILL NOW. INCLUDING" I'm so worried.

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,625
"THE STAFF OF THE ORIGINAL WEBSITE, WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS
OUR SINCERE THANKS TO YOU." I wonder if they're doing well.

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,167
"SINCE THERE'S NO FINAL ENDING IN THE ORIGINAL WORK,
THIS EPISODE IS ALMOST ORIGINAL." Calm down.

42
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,417
"BUT THE CONTENT IS ALSO FROM THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR,
TANNEN NI HAKKOU." Don't worry too much.

43
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:10,583
"THE LINES AND INSPIRATION OF DWARF CHARACTERS ARE DESIGNED
TO INTEGRATE THE CONTENTS BEFORE AND AFTER." Nonsense.

44
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:11,292
"FINALLY, WE CAN REST ASSURED. BUT IT'S LONELY TO END LIKE
THIS. HOPEFULLY, CARLA AND ALVIN CAN CONTINUE TO" Sh.

45
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,917
"GET ALONG. AND THE ORIGINAL STORY ISN'T OVER YET.
PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT." Celia finally fell asleep.

46
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,000
"THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING.
THANKS AGAIN SINCERELY." He's a real villain.

47
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,208
"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EPISODE TWELVE, "FINAL EPISODE"."
Dolman.

48
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:21,375
Yes. I wonder if Carla's "communication skills"
can come in handy.

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,917
I know, right?

50
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,750
I hope they can come back soon safely.

51
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,458
Carla.

52
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,750
What are you doing with the flowers?

53
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,958
Camouflage.

54
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,792
It's too eye-catching. Put them down.

55
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,125
Get down!

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,250
Brothers, how is it?

57
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,708
Is anything unusual?

58
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,208
He is...

59
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,375
The fugitive.

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,042
It's Brigan.

61
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,083
What a special posture of getting down.

62
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,792
Who would come to such a place?

63
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:55,125
Haven't the dwarfs revealed
where the imperial body is?

64
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,292
Yes. We can't be rough with them.

65
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,659
They're first-rate craftsmen, after all.

66
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,667
We can only sell them at a high price
if they're unharmed.

67
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:06,333
So he's an accomplice of Dolman.

68
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,583
It seems so.

69
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,375
He ruins the reputation of adventurers.

70
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,625
-Reconnaissance over.
-Thank you for your hard work.

71
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,125
On the left side of the castle, there's a cell
that seems to be surrounded by a high wall.

72
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,125
All right. Fortunately, tonight is the new moon.

73
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,625
Let's sneak into it in the dark.

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,167
Be quiet. No talking.

75
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,958
What are you doing?

76
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,042
Your body language is too annoying.

77
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:39,208
I suggest that Ryoko takes us in.

78
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,500
It's hard to understand.

79
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,333
Can you really do it?

80
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:47,458
I can put you in my body
if there are only two people.

81
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,333
Put us in your clothes...

82
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,250
We'll get in your bag.

83
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,458
We're here.

84
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:04,167
Be quiet. There are two demon soldiers
guarding outside the wall.

85
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:08,750
The cell has been cast with dark magic,
so I can't get in.

86
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,917
Be careful, both of you.

87
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,458
I got it. Thank you.

88
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,333
It looks like nobody is guarding.

89
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,333
It's not even locked.

90
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,875
Fortunately, Brigan is a lazy guy.

91
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,250
Are you going to ask us again?

92
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,542
No matter how many times you ask us,
we won't tell you where the imperial body is.

93
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,875
Be quiet. It'll be heard by the guards outside.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,375
We are your companions.

95
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,375
That's right.

96
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,958
I'm all-loving and kind...

97
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,250
I'm here to save the dwarfs I don't like.

98
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,625
Shut up. Things will get very troublesome.

99
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,792
Is the village head here?

100
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,167
I'm the village head.

101
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,958
"I'M THE VILLAGE HEAD OF THE DWARFS."
I see.

102
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,833
My granddaughter asked you to save us.

103
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,167
Thank you.

104
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,583
She's hiding in a safe place.

105
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,667
Dolman's target seems to be the imperial body.

106
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:00,750
The imperial body can dispel dark magic
with holy power.

107
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,375
Dolman fears that power.

108
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,000
This castle is a fortress built
by our ancestors.

109
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,083
Although it has become a ruin,

110
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,542
the imperial body is hidden deep in the castle.

111
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,292
I'll tell you where it is.

112
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:18,250
Would you like to help us take down Dolman
and get us out?

113
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,042
What's wrong?

114
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,167
When you're asking for help,

115
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,542
shouldn't you kneel and kowtow...

116
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,625
Get the timing of speaking right!

117
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,208
We kneel and kowtow.

118
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,458
Please help us.

119
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,500
It took a lot of time to collect the items.
But we finally got in.

120
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,542
How soon we come to a fork.
Are we going straight?

121
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,333
Yes. There's a trap if we're going straight...

122
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,583
Then don't say "yes".

123
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,250
I'll pay attention to it next time.

124
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,875
It's a dead end.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,167
The maze is very complicated.
Could it be the wrong way?

126
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:57,833
We followed the map drawn by the village head.
It won't go wrong.

127
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,625
After pressing the slate
of the triangle symbol...

128
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,542
I see. There are hidden channels.

129
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,000
No. There will be a trap.

130
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,917
Sorry to trouble you again.

131
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,667
Please say that earlier.

132
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,750
I'll pay attention to it next time.

133
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,625
The imperial body should be in this room.

134
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,833
Have you asked how to open the door?

135
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,458
Yes.

136
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,208
Turn the stone statue on the right
90 degrees to the left.

137
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,750
All right. After turning...
Will there be a trap?

138
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,583
Yes, it's a complete trap.

139
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,375
Nonsense!

140
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,542
Don't you want to improve your unique skill?

141
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,833
I don't recall I have such a unique skill.

142
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,083
Every time I have to bother Ryoko to save me.

143
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,833
Hurry up and tell me the right order
to open the door!

144
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,292
How boring.

145
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,125
The dwarfs' skill is amazing.

146
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,208
Awesome.

147
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,958
Women's underwear made by dwarfs is also great.

148
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,958
Don't compare this to underwear.

149
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,333
That's the imperial body, right?

150
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,167
It seems so.

151
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,792
There should be no traps.

152
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,458
But just in case you stay here.

153
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,792
Okay.

154
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,458
It's different from what I thought.

155
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,833
Thank you for leading the way.

156
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,625
What?

157
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,750
Lord Dolman has seen it through.

158
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,000
Brigan! And that guy...

159
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,375
It's Dolman, the Dark Wizard.

160
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,125
I sensed the power of the dark elf,
so I came to have a look.

161
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,083
I didn't expect to hit the jackpot.

162
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,458
It means you sensed my charm.

163
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:27,583
-It's magic.
-I didn't sense your charm.

164
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,292
All right. Give me the crown.

165
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,667
You wish!

166
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,333
Hang on a second, Mr. Alvin.

167
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,750
Just leave it to me.

168
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,750
Since you're the villain boss,
I have something to say.

169
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,542
What is it?

170
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:46,292
If you would give us half the world,
we can negotiate.

171
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,875
That's not what good people should say.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,208
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to negotiate.

173
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,750
But if you give me the crown,
I can let you join my army as a soldier.

174
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,417
And Alvin, I'll order you about.

175
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,208
No, I'll do it.

176
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,125
I refuse!

177
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,917
Then...

178
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,083
Carla!

179
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,250
Geez, let go of Carla!

180
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,208
How? Would you give me the crown?

181
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,792
Carla, are you all right?

182
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,417
Miss Anna, thank you.

183
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,292
I was so worried, so I came.

184
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,542
Alvin, now!

185
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:31,458
Okay. Imperial body, break the dark magic!

186
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,042
Idiot!

187
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,792
Why?

188
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,000
Mr. Alvin!

189
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,375
Alvin!

190
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,583
Drop your weapon.

191
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:49,958
If you don't want her face hurt,
give me the crown.

192
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,250
No way. Run away.

193
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,042
Don't worry about me.
Before the imperial body is robbed...

194
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,000
But...

195
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,958
I still have the value of being a hostage,
so don't worry.

196
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:04,375
And it's like the lines the protagonist
would say. I've always wanted to say it.

197
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,208
I got it...

198
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,750
Ryoko, let's run away.

199
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,583
Okay.

200
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,042
Don't you run away.

201
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,458
Put that girl in the cell.

202
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,042
Quick, find it. Get the crown back.

203
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,833
It's great, right? You have value.

204
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,125
The selling price of the dark elf is very high.

205
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:41,208
It serves you right. Calamity Mine Healer was
left behind by the companion. You're alone now.

206
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,792
Mr. Alvin will come and save me.

207
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,292
Because he's a person
who can't see the atmosphere.

208
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,917
Give it back to me!

209
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,250
That's the medical expenses you kicked me.

210
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,625
-Give it back! Give it back! You fugitive!
-Just stay here.

211
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,583
Is that something important?

212
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,583
"SHOCKED"
There's no such thing. Shocked.

213
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,292
That's not the prize
for the first dungeon challenge. Shocked.

214
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,083
SHOCKED

215
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,333
What an understandable way of panic.

216
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:14,167
Is your adventurer companion really all right?

217
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,000
Mr. Alvin...

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,500
I see. Carla was caught voluntarily.

219
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,917
Elder sister...

220
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:26,208
Sorry, I'm not strong enough.

221
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,875
You've tried your best.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,875
I want to save her right away.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
But you can't use the imperial body smoothly...

224
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,042
Is there any other good way?

225
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,833
How far is it from here to the castle?

226
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,083
About two kilometers.

227
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,458
The curse that I'll die if I stay away
from her hasn't started.

228
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,083
Where's Altargaia?

229
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,833
Could he want to save Carla himself?

230
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,375
He disappeared without a word.
It's like running away.

231
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,250
I have no right to complain.

232
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,917
Don't you run away?

233
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:59,708
Wouldn't this party have been disbanded
if there had been no curse?

234
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,208
The party...

235
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,333
That's right. Only now.

236
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,667
All right. Let's run away.

237
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,333
We can't win if this thing
doesn't come in handy.

238
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,292
How rude!

239
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,125
It talked!

240
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,208
Huh?

241
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:18,208
My power will increase or decrease
according to the moon.

242
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,500
Tonight is the new moon.
My power will weaken.

243
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,875
That's why Dolman chose
to attack the dwarfs today.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,750
No wonder you couldn't exert power just now.

245
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,625
But there's a way to retrieve my power.

246
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,333
That's to let the healer cast magic on me.

247
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,458
The healer?

248
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:43,292
If she casts recovery magic on me,
I can use my maximum power.

249
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,000
I'd like to ask a question.

250
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,167
The curse on me was suddenly lifted.

251
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,542
Is it because of you?

252
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,167
Maybe.

253
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:54,500
You were naturally purified
due to the holy power.

254
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,667
I see.

255
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:59,417
Then I won't die even leaving Carla.

256
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,500
Is Carla the girl you were with?

257
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,375
Yes...

258
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,375
Let me tell you something.

259
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:09,700
You and that girl had a "deep" fate
in your previous lives.

260
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,792
What did you say?

261
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,792
Half a century ago,

262
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:16,458
you were lovers of the elves.

263
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,583
But your people were eliminated
by the Dark Wizard army.

264
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,667
You swear to tie the knot
when you're reincarnated.

265
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:31,625
You've lost the memory of your previous lives.
But you travelled together because of destiny.

266
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,167
Carla and I...

267
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:39,958
After defeating your old enemy,
the Dark Wizard, your true love can be united.

268
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,875
True love?

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,833
Hold on. Half a century ago?

270
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,958
In terms of human age, Carla is still a kid,

271
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,125
but she's been alive for 72 years.

272
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,292
No, this is...

273
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,000
If they were reincarnations of lovers,

274
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,875
they should've gotten along better.

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,917
You're right.

276
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,125
Oh, it really didn't work!

277
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,417
I thought that would make you more motivated.

278
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,875
-So you tricked me.
-Escapology.

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,875
Don't you run away!

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,042
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

281
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,083
I'm the warrior in this party.

282
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,250
I'll do whatever I have to do.

283
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,458
Even if my level is 100 for the beginners

284
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,208
and bracket laugh for adventurers level

285
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,875
I'll never give up justice.

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,792
You're... so weak.

287
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,958
I shouldn't have said that.

288
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,667
It looks like nobody's guarding.

289
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,057
It's obviously weird.

290
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,417
Listen.

291
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:37,250
Put me in the center
of the enchanting magic array.

292
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,750
Holy power will remove the enchantment.

293
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:44,250
So I can use magic in the cell.

294
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,833
What's wrong?

295
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,750
Sorry, I don't have enough magic.

296
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,292
You can't be of use at all.

297
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:56,875
What if we don't have Ryoko's sweeping items?

298
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,125
What a capable maid.

299
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,250
More capable than you!

300
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,542
Geez, Brigan already locked it.

301
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,875
Ryoko, I'll leave it to you.

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,875
Okay.

303
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,792
Sorry to keep you waiting.

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,875
Did you call me? I'm here. I'm Carla.

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,292
I'll complain about you later.

306
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,375
Hurry and cast strong recovery magic
on the crown.

307
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,625
All right. Ryoko told me the whole story.

308
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,792
Let's start.

309
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:28,667
Holy power,
give the crown the power to resurrect.

310
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,500
Add the power of thought.

311
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,750
Evil thoughts?

312
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,917
There's no time to joke with you.

313
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,667
I feel bad...

314
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,083
Imperial body, how is it?

315
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,625
Thank you for trying hard.
But the magic isn't enough.

316
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,000
It still doesn't work.

317
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,208
What?

318
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,708
You showed me interesting scenes.

319
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,208
Give up on struggling, Alvin.

320
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,083
They really found out.

321
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,417
Ryoko, let's run away.

322
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,583
All right.

323
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,000
Miss Ryoko.

324
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,750
Don't you run away!

325
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,833
I'll teach you a lesson first,
then take the crown.

326
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,708
What do you think, Mr. Alvin?

327
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,167
Then I'll deal with the healer.

328
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,500
The maid who can't move is so boring.

329
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,667
Geez. What should we do?

330
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:21,125
Run away now and come back at the full moon...

331
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,708
Mr. Alvin.

332
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,500
Everything is over. Is this the end?

333
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,042
-Not yet.
-Carla.

334
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:32,167
For the village head who knelt and kowtowed
to me, I can't give them the imperial body.

335
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,833
I'll fight, too.

336
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,667
Don't force yourself.

337
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,500
You'll be defeated.

338
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,833
Somebody...

339
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,458
Come and help us!

340
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,458
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.

341
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,542
Is everyone all right?

342
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:47,792
Altargaia!

343
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:48,583
Miss Anna.

344
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,917
Even the golem is here.

345
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,958
The forest buddies are here, too. Roar.

346
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,375
We'll fight together. Moo.

347
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,833
Bad people are unforgivable.

348
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,458
Beat them up.

349
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,042
Especially the one who bullied Carla.

350
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,042
Everyone...

351
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,792
Why are they all good people?

352
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,458
We have the advantage in quantity.

353
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,708
Come on!

354
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,667
Kuma!

355
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,750
Moo!

356
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,542
Bring it o...

357
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,333
All right. I knew what you were going to say.
Look up.

358
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,167
Really? Don't I have to start over?

359
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,125
Take my secret medicine attack!

360
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,667
Puff, I'll beat you all at once.

361
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,458
Giant pig cyclone!

362
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,417
Puff...

363
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:28,583
What's wrong?

364
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,500
I sprained my ankle.

365
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,292
Here you go. Apply the bandage.

366
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,875
I won't let you in!

367
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,667
Everyone is still fighting outside.

368
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,375
Wait until it's over, then go out.

369
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,375
-Grandpa.
-Celia.

370
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,833
I'm glad you're fine, Grandpa.

371
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,292
I've tried my best.

372
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,042
You really tried your best.

373
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,292
Celia.

374
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,958
The kid's pronunciation is not very accurate.

375
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:55,917
It's easy to deal with figures
who can't avoid the eyes.

376
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,000
Your magic is useless.

377
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,958
That's what you got me for letting me do it.

378
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,875
My turn. It's my turn next.

379
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,125
All you have to do is "ha".

380
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,542
I want to play, too.

381
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,417
Brigan, recovery magic.

382
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,625
Brother Brigin, I'm coming.

383
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,750
You wish.

384
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,042
Punish them as much as you like.

385
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,542
Call me queen.

386
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,167
Your opponent is me.

387
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,792
Wait a second.

388
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,375
Don't do this to them.

389
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
Come on, sister.

390
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,917
Protect Miss Maria!

391
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,167
Follow my orders, Undead Wolf.

392
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,708
And me.

393
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,167
Miss Maria, thank you.

394
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,042
It's gross yet lovely.
It's a little contradictory.

395
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,083
Well.

396
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,833
Ellie, go back.

397
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,333
Okay.

398
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,542
-Run.
-Run. Run.

399
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,958
Come on.

400
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,917
It serves you right. I'll bury you all.

401
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,750
Bury them all.

402
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,375
Open it. Open it.

403
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:04,008
I'll scare you to death and level up.

404
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,250
Is there anybody open it?

405
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,167
It's unexpectedly difficult to deal with.

406
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:09,958
Right.

407
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,792
Carla, above you!

408
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,167
"MARIA"
Good job.

409
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,583
Amazing.

410
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,292
Thank you. You saved us.

411
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:22,208
But the demon soldiers
keep coming out endlessly.

412
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,083
That's right. We have to block the source.

413
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:26,958
Where's Alvin?

414
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,667
Everybody, look over there.

415
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,708
Mr. Alvin.

416
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,500
He rushed up alone, bear.

417
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,875
I think so.

418
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,833
Only Alvin has the item to fight Dolman.

419
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,167
But my magic is too weak.

420
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,542
I can't recover the imperial body.

421
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,542
Isn't that terrible?

422
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,292
In that case...

423
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,500
When we run out of energy,

424
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,708
we'll all die...

425
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,833
Just adding magic will do, bear?

426
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,875
It's too late, adventurer.

427
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,333
Geez, I failed.

428
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,583
Did you want to catch me off guard?

429
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:07,125
If you have the crown's power,
you can fight with me.

430
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,375
Shut up.

431
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,917
Stop yelling, you outcast.

432
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:12,375
I'm invincible if there's no crown.

433
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,667
I can even get the whole world.

434
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:17,625
I'll eliminate your head with the crown.

435
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,583
Mr. Alvin!

436
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,000
Carla!

437
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,292
He was caught.

438
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:23,458
Holy power.

439
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:28,833
-The wand I gave you can enhance magic.
-Give the crown the power to resurrect.

440
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,042
There's endless power.

441
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,833
Alvin, take off your helmet and just wear me.

442
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,875
Got it.

443
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,208
Take this.

444
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,250
I'll beat you down.

445
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,625
You wish. I'll just cut off your head
and take the crown.

446
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,083
My body is so light.

447
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,000
It's because of my support.

448
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,542
-Amazing.
-What a difference. Even his appearance.

449
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,667
Are they well-matched?

450
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:01,875
No, he's been suppressed.

451
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,417
I'm here to support you.

452
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,875
Mr. Alvin.

453
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,667
This is power enhancing magic.

454
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,375
That's...

455
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll take that.

456
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,000
What... has been enhanced...

457
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,667
It enhanced flavour and taste.

458
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,958
Carla, you're amazing.

459
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,708
I'm not surprised at all.

460
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,292
-But well done.
-Upside down. Upside down.

461
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,958
Thank you, everybody!

462
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,375
Triplets?

463
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,833
I didn't expect Dolman is so old.

464
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,125
What a great achievement.

465
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,958
There should be stars next time
the ranking is determined.

466
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,167
I was just fighting with an old man.

467
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:51,625
And there was support from the imperial body.

468
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,458
I almost forgot it.

469
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,542
Give this back to me.

470
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,458
Sanko!

471
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,333
She's still looking well.

472
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,750
You cherish that badge so much.

473
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,792
It doesn't matter. Hurry back to the village.

474
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,792
You have to return the imperial body
to the village head.

475
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,375
How should I thank you?

476
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,125
I'd like to thank you.

477
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,375
My curse was lifted.

478
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,292
That matter...

479
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:30,375
Without me, the curse might start again.

480
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,208
Be careful.

481
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,917
How come?

482
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,875
Mushroom, ghost, everybody, goodbye.

483
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,292
Take care.

484
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,958
Let's play together next time.

485
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,375
-I have to stay with Carla again.
-Okay. I'll be waiting for you.

486
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,750
But I've been a one-person party
for a long time.

487
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,333
Such a big party was formed unknowingly.

488
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,417
All the members have strong personalities.

489
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:57,208
But I wouldn't be able to fight Dolman
without them.

490
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,833
Is it thanks to Carla...

491
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,958
What's the matter?
Why are you staring at my face?

492
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,125
Nothing...

493
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,958
Have you fallen for me again
because of the battle?

494
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,292
It seems that my charm is irresistible indeed.

495
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,583
What are you talking about?

496
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,375
I appreciate your sentiment.

497
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,333
Well.

498
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,708
But I think...

499
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,458
It's too pathetic.

500
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,708
Pathetic.

501
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,375
You're so annoying.

502
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,292
This healer is really annoying!
