1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,833
There are many monsters threatening humans

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,708
in the vast world where we live.

3
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:15,250
Many adventurers and heroes

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,833
stepped forward bravely.

5
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,833
They face many dangerous challenges today

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,083
to protect the people and the world.

7
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:31,500
And I, Alvin, is one of them.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,208
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

9
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,917
let's continue the adventure today.

10
00:00:51,458 --> 00:01:00,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

11
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,250
THE TITLE

12
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,750
ALVIN, WHO WAS ON THE JOURNEY WITH THE HEALER CARLA,
WANTED TO COLLECT DETOXIFYING HERBS FOR SOME PURPOSE

13
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,250
BUT FOUGHT WITH GHOSTS IN THE CEMETERY ON THE WAY.
JUST WHEN THEY'LL SOLVE THE CRISIS IN AN INEXPLICABLE WAY,

14
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,750
HE ACCIDENTALLY FELL INTO GOBLINS' TRAP
AND MADE TEAMMATE A EXHAUSTED.

15
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,250
THE CURSE HASN'T BEEN LIFTED,
SO HE CAN'T SEPARATE FROM CARLA.

16
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,750
I THINK I'LL BE EXHAUSTED.
AND SUCH A LONG TITLE CONTAINS

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,500
THE NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO THE END?

18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,958
"CAN'T WAIT FOR"
It should be this way.

19
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,875
"EPISODE TWO"
Where are we heading?

20
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,958
And what are we going to do?

21
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,500
Mr. Alvin.

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,417
To collect detoxifying grass.

23
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,750
It's the quest I accepted
at the Adventurer Guild.

24
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,292
I fought with that bear yesterday.

25
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:39,208
I didn't manage to reach the destination.

26
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,917
Collecting detoxifying herbs
is the task of a beginner.

27
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,000
But the difficulty is just right for Mr. Alvin

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
as a beginner adventurer.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,458
Since you're a healer,
can't you say something nice?

30
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:05,750
Geez. If it weren't for the strange curse,
I would've disbanded the party.

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,167
Mr. Alvin.

32
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:10,167
Is this really the right way?

33
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,292
Yes, just go straight.

34
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:17,833
We'll pass through there if we go straight…

35
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,625
Mr. Alvin, to your right.

36
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,417
Next one to your north-north-west.

37
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:03,750
Sorry, I got it wrong.
It's 20 degrees to your right.

38
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,125
Then it's the direction of 8:52.

39
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,500
And then the direction of the ox and tiger.

40
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,167
Didn't you hear that?

41
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,667
Hello.

42
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,708
Your directions are too hard to understand.

43
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,375
Are you having a picnic?

44
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:28,583
You... I'm fighting, yet you're relaxing.

45
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,792
Listen.

46
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm just taking a break.

47
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,292
You're having an afternoon tea break.

48
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,208
Why are you getting angry?

49
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,750
I also prepared a sandwich for you.

50
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,875
I'm not mad at this.

51
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,875
But I ate it.

52
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,125
Now I'm mad.

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,333
We have to get rid of them to move on.

54
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,458
It's so quiet today.

55
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,417
Because there are only ghosts.

56
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,042
I'm the only one fighting.

57
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,750
At least lend me a hand.

58
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,458
What's with your face?

59
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:09,750
Well... Physical attacks don't work on ghosts.

60
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:13,667
You have to use magic or a silver weapon.

61
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,333
Really?

62
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,625
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,833
Hey, why did you apologize suddenly?

64
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,542
I knew you were a beginner.

65
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:32,375
If I could explain it well,
you wouldn't face such an embarrassing scene.

66
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,917
Stop it.

67
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,667
We all make mistakes.

68
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:42,583
It's my first time fighting against ghosts,
after all.

69
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,042
All right, stop yelling.

70
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,542
Who yelled? You...

71
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,667
Your dance steps just now…

72
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:55,417
Your fighting pose was cool.

73
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,542
Yes, it was like a circus…

74
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,208
Who's the clown?

75
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,917
I'm praising you.

76
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:05,042
Clowns are willing to be the laughing stocks
to make people laugh.

77
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:07,667
But I'm not going to be laughed at.

78
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,208
Honestly. You'd only say these.

79
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,583
If that's the case, do something about it.

80
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,500
Have you forgotten what my profession is?

81
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,208
A stress manufacturing machine.

82
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:23,917
I'm angry. You should at least call me
the goddess of stress.

83
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,792
That's what makes people stressed.

84
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,125
As you can see, I'm a healer.

85
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,458
That is, a cleric.

86
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,458
I doubt that.

87
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,708
The existence of giving peace to the lost souls.

88
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,375
What? Smash them with light magic?

89
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:41,125
Do you use violence only to solve problems?

90
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,750
How sad.

91
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,750
I'm so sad that I want to cry.

92
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,958
How pathetic.

93
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,292
You don't have to do this.

94
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:53,000
Ghosts still hold on to something in mind.
That's why they're wandering in this world.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,792
I just have to get rid of it for them.

96
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,000
I see.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,750
Can you do that?

98
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,500
Listen to them and reply with
"how sad" and "I get it".

99
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,292
Then they can attain enlightenment. Easy-peasy.

100
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,833
Girls' party?

101
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,250
The ghost floating over there.

102
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,042
Is it me?

103
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,375
Are you holding on to something?

104
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,250
Yes.

105
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,208
I died at the age of 20.

106
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,542
Only two weeks after I finally got a girlfriend,
I died.

107
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,125
How sad. I get it.

108
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,542
It's super BD.

109
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:32,500
Don't fool the dead, you self-proclaimed cleric.

110
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,625
What do you mean?

111
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,083
Mr. Alvin here is over 30 years old.

112
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,625
I heard he hadn't dated a woman yet.

113
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,750
And you're fooling the living.

114
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:48,250
Thank you. I didn't know I lived happily.

115
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,792
Even the dead fooled me.

116
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,875
Excuse me…

117
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:52,583
Yes.

118
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,167
I used to be a warrior.

119
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,375
But I was killed by a golem. I'm so sad.

120
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,417
Mr. Alvin, can you defeat a golem?

121
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,625
No. I want to take the challenge.

122
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,750
But now, bringing five slimes down is my limit.

123
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,208
Five slimes. How weak.

124
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,417
It's so funny.

125
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,042
-I knew it.
-Laughing out loud.

126
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:22,500
Amazing. They're called by the Lord one by one.

127
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,167
-And with satisfied smiles.
-That's mocking.

128
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,917
Mr. Alvin, you may have potential.

129
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,042
Potential? What is it?

130
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,917
Normal people can't make ghosts
attain enlightenment.

131
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,083
You're talented, indeed.

132
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,208
Will there be the light attribute?

133
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,958
The Paladin of Light.

134
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,458
The Holy Knight.

135
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,875
Stop it.

136
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,458
Circus cl…

137
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,208
I'm not a clown.

138
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,208
Finally we broke through the cemetery.

139
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,625
I'm so tired.

140
00:08:54,625 --> 00:09:01,083
Actually, you can choose to be there
to make ghosts attain enlightenment.

141
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:06,083
NOW FREE TO ATTAIN ENLIGHTENMENT
BY ALVIN THE PALADIN OF LIGHT

142
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,208
Don't be silly.

143
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,125
I'm just a warrior.
I don't intend to switch my profession.

144
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,833
I think your talent is used in the wrong place.

145
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,333
It's often said that

146
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,167
what you want to do is totally different
from what you can do.

147
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,667
I'm returning the whole sentence to you.

148
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,083
All right, let's go.

149
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,583
I haven't completed the task.

150
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,083
Mr. Alvin.

151
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,375
Mr. Alvin.

152
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,958
Collecting detoxifying herbs
is an easy task indeed.

153
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,500
But there are many things to be careful about.

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,125
Especially this forest is
where the goblins live.

155
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,375
They're not strong but very tricky.

156
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:54,667
If you're not careful,
you'll fall into the goblins' trap.

157
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,167
Just like this.

158
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,417
Are you all right?

159
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:16,208
Are you in this mode to confirm
the safety of your teammate?

160
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,417
What a relief. I'm so worried about you.

161
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,542
You seem so relaxed.

162
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,125
How do you feel now?

163
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,500
I feel very humiliated.

164
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,958
It feels like "I'd find a hole in the ground
and hide", right?

165
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,917
No, you're already in a hole.

166
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,417
Can you shut up?

167
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,208
Can you get out?

168
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,833
Let me try it.

169
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,583
It's difficult.
The soil is too soft and easy to collapse.

170
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,458
Is there anything like a rope around you?

171
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,083
Like a rope... Large intestine.

172
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,042
You have a great imagination.

173
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,208
How would you think of large intestines
when you heard rope.

174
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,708
Even the necromancers can't do it.

175
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,875
A rope won't just fall like this.

176
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,958
The large intestine won't fall off too, okay?

177
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,083
Or give me a branch. Can you hurry up?

178
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,833
If a monster finds out, I'll be the best meal.

179
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,292
I got it.

180
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,875
I'll look for it nearby.

181
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,375
Don't go too far away.

182
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,958
I'll die if you're 300 meters away from me.

183
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,292
Have you been waiting?

184
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,583
Not at all.

185
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,958
The conversation just now was like

186
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,750
between a couple who met for a date.

187
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,750
How gross.

188
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,000
What?

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,708
So did you look for it?

190
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:38,708
Sorry, I can't find something like intestines.

191
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,458
That's great.

192
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,583
But I happened to meet someone.
So I asked him to come over.

193
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,833
Here.

194
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,833
Someone? There's someone in the forest?

195
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,750
It's the person who dug this trap.

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,750
He's a goblin, isn't he?

197
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,292
Isn't it good?

198
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,625
It's terrible.
Why did you ask a monster to come over?

199
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,375
Can you still be willful in this situation?

200
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:04,375
Of course. For him, I'm now…

201
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,083
Why is he crying?

202
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,083
What's wrong with you, Mr. Gobukichi?

203
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,917
So you've introduced yourselves...

204
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:17,292
Why are you crying?
Mr. Alvin should be the one who wants to cry.

205
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:19,000
Look how miserable he is.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,833
That's right.

207
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:27,083
I made that trap to catch a boar.

208
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,458
Mr. Gobukichi.

209
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,667
But instead, I caught this kind of...

210
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,125
Apologize.

211
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,833
Is it my fault?

212
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:53,333
We'll soon reach where
the detoxifying herbs grow.

213
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,917
Oh no, it's a Cyclops.

214
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's run away before he finds us out.

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,833
Hold on.

216
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,583
Is it a good way?

217
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,667
You can't grow

218
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,667
if you always escape from your fears.

219
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,208
Such a person will eventually…

220
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,500
end up like you, Mr. Alvin.

221
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm originally me, okay?

222
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,875
So let's bring down the Cyclops.

223
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,833
Oh.

224
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,000
What's with oh?

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,500
I said my limit is bringing five slimes down.

226
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,875
You said bring it down. Do you have any plans?

227
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,208
Isn't that I'm the secret plan?

228
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,333
-It's great, right?
-I'll never use this secret plan all my life.

229
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,750
So what are you going to do?

230
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,792
Mr. Alvin, I'm a healer.

231
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,417
"THUMP"
I can use a summoning spell.

232
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,875
Can a healer do that?

233
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,542
Young healers nowadays
master summoning spells, too.

234
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,333
You should master common sense first.

235
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,000
So what can you summon?

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,583
Do you want to see it?

237
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:05,167
I can summon the lowest level familiar
without any rituals.

238
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,625
Really? Let's see it then.

239
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,083
I'm getting interested in it.

240
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,583
All right.

241
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,208
Put it back. What did you summon?
The devil's fingertips?

242
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,667
There's no choice. It's the lowest level one.

243
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:28,500
If I prepare a ritual well,
I can summon a decent familiar.

244
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,958
But it takes some time.

245
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,792
Come to think of it.
We haven't been found out by the Cyclops.

246
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,625
Why don't you summon it before we're found?

247
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't do that. No way.

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,625
Why?

249
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,958
It's not... enthusiastic enough.

250
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,542
Don't pursue that.

251
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:50,500
Anyway, Mr. Alvin has been noisy…

252
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,250
Whose fault is this?

253
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,583
We've been found.

254
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,708
Sorry... I'm not ready yet.

255
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,042
Okay. I'll wait for you.

256
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,750
How nice.

257
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,250
It's willing to wait.

258
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,042
No need.

259
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:15,250
I'm ready to summon.

260
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,583
What's that?

261
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,292
Let the paper plane fly into the air.

262
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,167
It can fly through the dimensions
and reach the familiar.

263
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,750
The familiar that receives the paper plan
will come over.

264
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,208
It's my own summoning spell.

265
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,083
Let's go.

266
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,500
It came back.

267
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,042
It's from the familiar.

268
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,875
The neighbor asked me
to take care of the child.

269
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:48,792
So I can't come.

270
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,750
That's so nice.

271
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,250
So

272
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,625
why did you come to this rock field?

273
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,958
Well… Actually…

274
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:06,042
Collecting detoxifying herbs.
You should've said that earlier.

275
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,708
Sorry for helping us lead the way.

276
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,250
This rock field is my sphere of influence.

277
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,208
I'm familiar with it here.

278
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,042
Are there detoxifying herbs?

279
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,542
Yes, it's right here.

280
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,458
You can pick as many as you want.

281
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,625
I hope it can alleviate the pain
of those poisoned people.

282
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,917
Goodbye.

283
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,792
I'm sorry. Thank you.

284
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,125
Thank you very much.

285
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,625
He's so nice.

286
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,250
Luckily, there's no need to summon the familiar.

287
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,417
My judgement was right.

288
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,875
It's just a coincidence.

289
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,542
It's rare that the atmosphere is so good.
Can you not make me mad?

290
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,458
We've collected many detoxifying herbs.

291
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,333
But it's dark now.

292
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,167
Let's camp here tonight.

293
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,708
You're right.

294
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,000
How tired. I'm exhausted.

295
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,833
After forming a party with Carla,

296
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,917
I feel more tired.

297
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:15,750
It's harder to form a party than I thought.

298
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,250
I thought it'd be easier to form a party
with a healer.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,542
What's wrong with her?

300
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,333
Is she really a healer?

301
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,167
She even summoned a disgusting familiar today.

302
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,917
Does she know how to use magic?

303
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:33,250
Oomune Bear shouldn't have lied to me.

304
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,375
She did heal my injury.

305
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,125
But her attire is really strange.

306
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,292
Isn't her real identity a demon girl?

307
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:46,125
I'm so tired because she absorbed my spirit.

308
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,917
Just take advantage of it now…

309
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:52,708
No. I'll die if she's 300 meters away from me.

310
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,708
I can't run at all.

311
00:17:55,708 --> 00:18:01,333
Forget it. There's no real harm
except curse and mental stress.

312
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,625
Let's look at the situation again.

313
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,542
She doesn't understand others' feelings.

314
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,750
How relaxed she is.

315
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,125
You've been anxious since just now.
It annoys me.

316
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,500
What's wrong?

317
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,375
You asked me that.

318
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,417
In this situation... Normally...

319
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,333
We'll start talking about love stories, right?

320
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,458
It's not a party all night.

321
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,125
Aren't we going to talk about that?

322
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,042
Don't look down on camping.

323
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:27,625
Many monsters will appear at night.

324
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:32,042
We must be alert and take turns to rest...

325
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,500
Why are you laughing?

326
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,667
It's strange that the beginner
who fell into the trap

328
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,500
explained how dangerous it is at night.

329
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,708
Can't you use better words?

330
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,125
Aren't you too excited?

331
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,875
Are you fooling around with me?

332
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,875
No.

333
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,792
It's my first time camping.

334
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,958
So it's something new.

335
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:06,958
To speak like an adventurer...
I'm... a little excited.

336
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,750
What about you, Mr. Alvin?

337
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:14,250
I've camped a few times before.

338
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,000
But…

339
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,625
It's my first time camping

340
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,917
with a companion.

341
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,333
Mr. Alvin…

342
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,083
You don't have friends, do you?

343
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,958
You don't either.

344
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,583
Phew, I'm going to sleep.

345
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,333
It's so early. Are you an old man?

346
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,750
I feel tired just by talking.

347
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,958
You still seem energetic.

348
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,417
Then I'll sleep first.

349
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,375
It's fine.

350
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,750
You must be physically and mentally exhausted
since you fell into the trap.

351
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,750
Physical and mental fatigue
is 100% caused by you.

352
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,458
Wake me up in three hours.

353
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,625
Okay. In the meantime, I'll…

354
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,083
All right. Please be alert.

355
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,792
I'll sing a song.

356
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,042
Why?

357
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,083
Why did you ask such a strange question?

358
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,875
It's your train of thought that's strange.

359
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,417
Is there something wrong with you?

360
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,667
I'm going to sing a lullaby.

361
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:15,750
Phew, I might not appear like this.
But actually, I like singing.

362
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,000
Please like silence, too.

363
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,167
And my singing

364
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,500
was rated as "letting the flying birds fall".

365
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,167
Is it shock wave?

366
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,917
You're bad at winking.

367
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:30,167
Just listen as if you were cheated.

368
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,625
Well then. If I just listen…

369
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,875
Zing, daladaladaladala.

370
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,542
Okay. Stop it.

371
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,083
It was just the intro.

372
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,292
Who would sing a lullaby from the intro…

373
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:49,000
And why is there such a rock lullaby?

374
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,458
I'll sing a calmer one then…

375
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,417
That's the normal one.

376
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:55,458
Here I go.

377
00:20:55,458 --> 00:21:00,292
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

378
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:08,333
Listen to this relaxing song and sleep.

379
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,583
It sounds pretty good.

380
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,417
Be swallowed by endless fear.

381
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:17,458
Never wake up from a nightmare.

382
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,625
Feel painful and depressed.

383
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,000
Are you casting a curse?

384
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,833
How rude you are.
This song can put someone to sleep.

385
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,417
An eternal sleep, right?

386
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,792
I've been thinking that since I met you.

387
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,917
Are you really a healer?

388
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,458
Oh no, it was too loud that
it attracted a monster...

389
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,417
You're so noisy.

390
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,333
Don't you know what time it is now?

391
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,292
We got scolded.

392
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,208
Go to bed early.

393
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay.

394
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:25,667
"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW" "BUT IT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY HARD WHEN
HE FOUGHT THE SUDDENLY APPEARED MUSHROOM MONSTER"

395
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,667
"THE MAIN STORY HAS NOT YET COME UP,
BUT ITS RACE IS MAGIC MUSHROOM" Title of the next episode.

396
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,625
"I THOUGHT IT WAS A MAN WITH A LOUD VOICE, BUT IT SHOULD
ALSO BE" It has nothing to do with the terrible trip

397
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,292
"SUITABLE FOR A YOUNG VOICE AS IN THE ORIGINAL WORK.
THERE ARE ENDLESS SURPRISES" of two with Carla in Episode 2.

398
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,000
"THE VOICE ACTOR WAS NOT YET DECIDED WHEN THE TITLE WAS MADE
IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2021" Alvin, who continues to strive to

399
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,167
"WHO'LL BE IT? I ANTICIPATE IT. CAN ALVIN EVENTUALLY DEFEAT
THE MAGIC MUSHROOM?" become a monster-hunting adventurer,

400
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,125
"THIS TOPIC CAN'T BE ENDED IN EPISODE THREE, STAY TUNED"
may have a great ambition...
