1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,833
There are many monsters threatening humans

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,708
in the vast world where we live.

3
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:15,250
Many adventurers and heroes

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,833
stepped forward bravely.

5
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,833
They face many dangerous challenges today

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,083
to protect the people and the world.

7
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:31,500
And I, Alvin, is one of them.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,208
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

9
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,917
let's continue the adventure today.

10
00:00:51,458 --> 00:01:00,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

11
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,625
THE TITLE
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TERRIBLE TRIP

12
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,417
"OF TWO WITH CARLA IN EPISODE 2."
There's one thing I mind.

13
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,458
ALVIN, WHO CONTINUES TO STRIVE TO BECOME
A MONSTER-HUNTING ADVENTURER, MAY HAVE A GREAT AMBITION.

14
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,500
"BUT IT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY HARD WHEN HE FOUGHT"
What is it?

15
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,125
"THE SUDDENLY APPEARED MUSHROOM MONSTER."
All of a sudden.

16
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,583
THE MAIN STORY HAS NOT YET COME UP, BUT ITS RACE IS MAGIC
MUSHROOM. I THOUGHT IT WAS A MAN WITH A LOUD VOICE, BUT IT

17
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,625
"SHOULD ALSO BE SUITABLE FOR A YOUNG VOICE
AS IN THE ORIGINAL WORK." Are you really a healer?

18
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,417
THERE ARE ENDLESS SURPRISES. THE VOICE ACTOR WAS NOT YET
DECIDED WHEN THE TITLE WAS MADE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2021.

19
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:24,742
WHO'LL BE IT? I ANTICIPATE IT.
THIS TOPIC CAN'T BE ENDED IN EPISODE THREE.

20
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,333
CAN ALVIN EVENTUALLY DEFEAT THE MAGIC MUSHROOM?
THIS TOPIC CAN'T BE ENDED IN EPISODE THREE.

21
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,750
I was asking you, Miss Carla.

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,208
Were you asking me? Was it me?

23
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,958
Or who else?

24
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,000
Why did you ask so suddenly?

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,625
Do you think I'm not like a healer?

26
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,625
What's different?

27
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,708
Your whole existence.

28
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,333
I'm so gentle.

29
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,667
Objection.

30
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,208
I have a maternal instinct.

31
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,667
Objection.

32
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,792
How dare you doubt such a healing me.

33
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,625
There are too many objections.

34
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:55,083
Instead, I would like to ask
what "a healer" is to Mr. Alvin.

35
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,667
Well…

36
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,833
Gentle and having maternal instincts.

37
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,958
I can feel healed when we're together.

38
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,458
It's not like you at all. Why are you blushing?

39
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:13,833
And I've never seen you use proper magic.

40
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,042
Will you believe me once I use it?

41
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:20,583
Can I break two or three of your ribs?

42
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,167
Look. It's not something a healer would say.

43
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:28,125
If I want to use recovery magic,
you have to get hurt first.

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,208
Can't you use other…

45
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,083
Look over there.

46
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:40,208
Let's take humans for blood sacrifice
today as well.

47
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,958
Cut them into pieces, both young and old.

48
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,833
It's a monster. It seems ferocious.

49
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:50,333
Okay, I'm going to fight it.

50
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,708
I see.

51
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:55,500
You want me to use recovery magic
after you're killed, right?

52
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,542
Your assumption is a little strange.

53
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:00,250
Then can you defeat it, Mr. Alvin?

54
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,417
It may not be easy to win…

55
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,208
So you use enhanced magic.

56
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,125
On the monster? Are you a masochist?

57
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,792
On me!

58
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,458
But even if you said so…

59
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,875
Could it be that you can't do it?

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,042
Zero multiplied by anything is still zero.

61
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,750
What do you mean?

62
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,458
But if it proves that I'm a healer...

63
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,833
Can you do it?

64
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,625
Please stand over there.

65
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,000
Hurry up. Run.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,292
All right.

67
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,125
Do I need to be this far away?

68
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,792
I haven't used it for a long time,
so just in case.

69
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,042
Hold on. What do you mean by just in case?

70
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:52,208
-As far as I remember, it's like this…
-What will happen?

71
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,083
Are you listening?

72
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,625
Then like this.

73
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,500
I did it.

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,208
Wait a second.

75
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,958
I'm going to throw it.

76
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,250
Throw it?

77
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,500
You want to throw the "that thing"
that reflects your soul.

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,750
Mr. Alvin.

79
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,292
Don't worry.

80
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,958
Really?

81
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,792
It'll be fine.

82
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,917
It's not fine at all!

83
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,750
Now that proves it.

84
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,875
It proves that you're dangerous.

85
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:47,583
Actually, there's only one thing I mind

86
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,000
until I can't sleep well at night.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,708
Then stay up all night.

88
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm hungry.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,583
It's about time to have lunch.

90
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,000
All right, I'll listen.
Don't make a noise with that expression.

91
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,625
So what do you mind?

92
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,625
Something about you.

93
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,625
Could it be that…
I'm very attractive to the opposite sex?

94
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,625
I'll sue you.

95
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,417
Don't mention legal issues.

96
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,833
I'm just kidding.

97
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,083
I care about your strength.

98
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,500
My strength?

99
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,292
You used to say that your strength
is comparable to that of a slug.

100
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,958
It's the first time I know it.

101
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,667
Those who always claim to be weak

102
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,208
are actually very strong.

103
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,792
No, I'm not really strong.

104
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,750
No need to be humble.

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,583
To confirm your real strength, Mr. Slug,

106
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,250
please fight with that monster.

107
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,833
You're the one from just now...

108
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,500
You're alive.

109
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,125
Enhanced magic won't kill anybody.

110
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,542
Was that enhanced magic indeed?

111
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:15,125
Why did you pray in silence just now?

112
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,042
Are you scared? Are you confused?

113
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:21,583
I managed to survive the weird enhanced magic.

114
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,833
I'm this manner after the resurrection…

115
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,500
from the brink of death.

116
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,708
So you almost died.

117
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,250
It's magic enhanced by pain.

118
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,292
Probably.

119
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,917
Don't use magic that you're not sure about it.

120
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,375
What? Do you want to fight?

121
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,667
Its appearance doesn't change much.

122
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,542
Specifically, what did you enhance?

123
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,375
Its flavor.

124
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,000
I suddenly think I can win.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,292
Hold on mushroom.

126
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,583
Are other things not enhanced?

127
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,042
Like stamina or speed.

128
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,375
Chewiness… I guess.

129
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,167
You're treating me as food only.

130
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,875
You were going to eat me since before.

131
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,792
Geez.

132
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,417
No one wants to eat you.

133
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:13,167
I don't want to be the main course
of dinner so easily.

134
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,917
It's best to cook it with rice.

135
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,625
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,750
Take this.

137
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:24,708
Smoke.

138
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,958
No, it's…

139
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,292
Poison.

140
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,333
Mr. Alvin.

141
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,167
Fool, don't come over. It's a poisonous spore.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,792
Oh, it's poison.

143
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:38,458
It's dangerous indeed to be close to you.

144
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,625
Then I'll excuse myself.

145
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,625
No, come over here.

146
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,417
You just told me not to come over.

147
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,542
You changed your mind as soon as you said it.

148
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,208
Why are you so selfish?

149
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,958
So it's human nature.

150
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,833
Pathetic.

151
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,167
I'm sorry about that.

152
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:01,333
After all, I'm not well prepared.
I don't even have a gas mask.

153
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:07,542
I'm surprised that you didn't do anti-poison
preparation since we had to go into the forest.

154
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,167
Maybe because you're a beginner.

155
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,375
I was convinced by your argument.

156
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:17,583
Oh no, I accidentally inhaled some poison gas.

157
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,042
Are you all right?

158
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:21,042
Can you use detoxification magic?

159
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:23,333
Yes. Leave it to me.

160
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,125
I'll set you free right away.

161
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,542
We're talking about detoxification, aren't we?

162
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,042
Let's put the joke aside first.

163
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:35,250
I can use detoxification magic,
but just in case,

164
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,208
I think it's better to use preservation magic.

165
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,417
So I decided to use the item.

166
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,958
The detoxifying herbs we collected?

167
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,167
Yes.

168
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,750
And some weeds growing nearby.

169
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,042
Why is there this option?

170
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:54,583
"DEAD ALIVE"
More options and more diversified routes.

171
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,167
There are only two routes, dead and alive.

172
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:00,250
Don't prepare a bad ending on purpose.

173
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,125
By the way, why didn't the monster
continue to attack…

174
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:08,083
"POISONED"
Why would it be poisoned by itself?

175
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,417
You didn't do anything, okay?

176
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,667
Fortunately, it's a careless monster.

177
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,958
Carla, detoxify me now.

178
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,375
Okay.

179
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,500
It's so painful… It's so painful…

180
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm sad…

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,667
I'm so sad…

182
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,542
He's talking.

183
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:38,167
The monster has lived for a long time
and has high intelligence.

184
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,625
So he can talk like a human…

185
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,125
There's no need to explain that.

186
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,542
No, I don't want to die yet.

187
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,750
Save me.

188
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,000
Help. I need somebody.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,250
He seems to be asking for help.

190
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
Anyway, detoxify me first...

191
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,958
Carla.

192
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,208
Uh…

193
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,792
All right.

194
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,833
We're talking about servants, aren't we?

195
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay. If you ask so,

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,167
be my servant.

197
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,458
"SERVANT"
We're talking about detoxification.

198
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:16,375
Are… you going to save him?

199
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,417
"SHOCKED"
Shocked.

200
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,875
"SHOCKED"
I didn't think so. Shocked.

201
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,750
He's a monster. I'm not that stupid. Shocked.

202
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,167
"SHOCKED"
Your thinking is so noisy.

203
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,708
That's enough.

204
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,292
Is it the humanity you're good at?

205
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,458
Do you know what's going on now?

206
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:38,292
Even if you saved him, he might attack us again.

207
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:43,042
Can you make sure he won't attack others
if he survives?

208
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:49,417
You heard what he sang just now, right? "Let's
take humans for blood sacrifice today as well."

209
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,500
We can understand each other
through communication.

210
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,750
This idea is too idealistic.

211
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,417
Can't I… do it?

212
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,000
I've said it many times.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,917
After all, I'm a cleric.

214
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,875
I can't let go of the life
that's about to pass away.

215
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,625
He's a monster.

216
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,583
There's a difference…

217
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:21,542
After saving him, can't we make him do us
a favor or demand him to give us money or items?

218
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,292
It's intimidation.

219
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,625
You mean something that grinds metal.

220
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,208
That's a file.

221
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,333
A stick held by people
when they walk by the stairs.

222
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,458
That's a railing.

223
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,375
Accipitriformes Accipitridae in birds.

224
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,708
That's Buteo japonicus.

225
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,708
Consume when you're sick.

226
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,500
That's medicine. Enough!

227
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,083
Excuse me...

228
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,000
What?

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,125
Has the poisoning been cured?

230
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,792
As you say so…

231
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:50,750
You found out.

232
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,917
What?

233
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,875
Isn't he poisoned?

234
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,667
Idiot.

235
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:01,083
It was a show to trick the enemy.

236
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,250
When they mistakenly thought I was just
a mushroom and approached me stupidly,

237
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,583
I immediately used the attack plan.

238
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,083
Then you just keep lying down.

239
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,875
What a relief. You played it.

240
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,417
Did you click your tongue?

241
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,042
Are you upset that the occasion
for you to perform is gone?

242
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,125
Is she really a cleric?

243
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm going to ask that.

244
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,958
All right. Don't be so mad.

245
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,250
Let me tell you a good thing.

246
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,208
What is it?

247
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:34,917
It was just smoke, not poison gas.

248
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,167
I was startled, too.

249
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,667
It was just smoke.

250
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,792
But you shouted, "it's a poisonous spore."

251
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,000
You even looked unwell.

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,625
But it should be okay now.

253
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,167
Isn't it great?

254
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,625
Did you think it's poison?

255
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,417
No, it shouldn't be.

256
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:05,583
What's wrong? Why don't you say anything?

257
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,667
Don't hesitate. Just say anything you want.

258
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:14,167
You're not a beginner.
You shouldn't have made such a mistake, right?

259
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,417
You…

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,833
Hey you, it's not good.
Don't laugh at others' mistakes.

261
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,792
I saw her laughing like this for the first time.

262
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,750
Laughing wickedly.

263
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,708
Honestly.

264
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,708
Forget it this time.

265
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,625
You've been laughing too long.

266
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,750
I feel so hungry after laughing.

267
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,833
That's right.

268
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,167
Well then.

269
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,667
Let's go and eat something.

270
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,625
Raise your hand and say what you want to eat.

271
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,583
Me.

272
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,833
Eating mushroom pot and rice cooked
with mushroom would be nice.

273
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,458
So you really want to eat me.

274
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,583
Geez.

275
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,792
Again?

276
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:25,292
I don't want to be the main course
of dinner so easily.

277
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,375
It turned out to be the same
after taking so much time.

278
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,917
Tempura would be nice, too.

279
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,042
Since its chewiness has been enhanced.

280
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,333
Don't fool around together.

281
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,083
Bring it on.

282
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,042
There's no other choice.

283
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:48,333
Okay then.
I was going to test my strength by fighting.

284
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,542
Let me show you my strength.

285
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,375
Let's do it.

286
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:34,167
I should've helped Mr. Alvin
enhance his chewiness.

287
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,083
Geez…

288
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,958
I WON

289
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,417
It rained heavily all of a sudden.

290
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:49,250
Fortunately, there's a cave nearby.

291
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,375
How's your injury?

292
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,917
Mr. Alvin.

293
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:57,083
Mr. Alvin.

294
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,500
Why would it be…

295
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,042
I'm right here.

296
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,333
It hurts…

297
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,417
Are you all right?

298
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:06,083
Sorry, I took it seriously.

299
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,833
Don't get too excited. Stay quietly.

300
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,083
I'm cared about by the monster who defeated me.

301
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,083
How reluctant.

302
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,250
There's no such thing.

303
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,458
At least I think you're really great, Mr. Alvin.

304
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,542
Don't comfort others if you're bad at it.

305
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,083
And don't throw my helmet.

306
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,875
Why? I really think you're great.

307
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,083
You're this weak to be an adventurer.

308
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,625
You have a strong mind indeed.

309
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,875
Can't you comfort me well?

310
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,792
If you yell, your injury will get worse.

311
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,542
-Good boy.
-Who's the stray dog?

312
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,750
Like after fighting with Oomune Bear,

313
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,875
let me use recovery magic on you.

314
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,708
Because I'm a healer.

315
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,917
Are you still calling yourself a healer?

316
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:50,792
Of course.

317
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:53,583
Be careful, or I'll smash your mouth.

318
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,792
That's not something someone who's going
to use recovery magic would say.

319
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,667
Which part did you get injured most seriously?

320
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,458
Is it your face?

321
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,708
Your brain, I suppose.

322
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,833
That's serious.

323
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,917
I hit you too hard.
Even your armor inside is affected.

324
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:12,958
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,708
I didn't expect you to know martial arts.

326
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,833
Can you really heal me?

327
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,667
Don't worry so much.

328
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,583
Have I ever let you down?

329
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,000
Have you ever given me hope?

330
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,583
Be ready.

331
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,542
Don't dress like that.

332
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,750
Please listen to... my wish...

333
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,958
You didn't seem to heal me.

334
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,417
Please stop it.

335
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,083
When you got hurt by Oomune Bear,

336
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,583
I cured you like this.

337
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,500
Your way is too weird.

338
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,958
Isn't there a more peaceful way
to cast the spell?

339
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,750
Then…

340
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:03,167
How about this?

341
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,708
Can't you cast the spell without cosplay?

342
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,875
It looks like there's no fracture.

343
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,750
Just use a little magic will do.

344
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,875
Or you can use herbs.

345
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,958
That's right.

346
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,292
Herbs may be more effective than weird magic.

347
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,542
Using herbs can't prove my strength.

348
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,250
Just pray then.

349
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,625
When did it come to prove your strength?

350
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,458
Wait and see.

351
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:37,375
As long as there's the miracle of God,
your injury will heal soon.

352
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,250
I'm so worried.

353
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,833
I'll start it.

354
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,333
Oh mighty one,

355
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:47,917
Please heal the injured body of Alvin,
the warrior, by your miracle.

356
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:51,708
He's a pitiful loser.

357
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,083
He really needs to be saved.

358
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,000
Hold on.

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,750
Please, God.

360
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,708
I can't look at him like this anymore.

361
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,333
Please hurry up and heal him.

362
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,083
Stop it!

363
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,875
How is it? Are you cured?

364
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,833
How could I be cured?

365
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,583
Don't click your tongue.

366
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,000
I didn't do it at you.

367
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,792
Who else would it be?

368
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,417
The god who didn't heal you…

369
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,000
You'll be punished by God.

370
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,125
And Mr. Alvin who hasn't been healed.

371
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,125
So it's me.

372
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,083
And the hateful Mr. Slug.

373
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,708
So it's still me… No!

374
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,750
Hey, both of you.

375
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,833
The rain stopped.

376
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,708
It's true.

377
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,208
It hurts… It was raining heavily just now…

378
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,583
Since the weather has recovered, let's go.

379
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,833
The weather…

380
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,708
Recovered.

381
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,542
Recovered?

382
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,458
It's definitely not you!

383
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,625
By the way…

384
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,375
Why are you following us?

385
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,417
Because I'm worried.

386
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:17,708
That's right.

387
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:21,292
It makes us worried to leave Mr. Alvin alone.

388
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:25,958
Don't be unconcerned.
You're also someone to be concerned with.

389
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,833
And it doesn't seem boring following you.

390
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,833
Mr. Mushroom, sorry for having you
carry my backpack.

391
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,167
It's okay.

392
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,333
What's your name?

393
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,042
Altargaia.

394
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:41,083
Nice to meet you, Mr. Altargaia.

395
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,083
Your name sounds cool.

396
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,542
It's cooler than Mr. Alvin's name.

397
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:47,667
Don't compare it with my name.

398
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,125
"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW"
Title of the next episode.

399
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:30,417
"IT'S GREAT INDEED."
Alvin and Carla challenge a dungeon for the first time.

400
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:31,703
"THE TRAP CAVE HERE"
The dungeon

401
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,125
"APPEARED ENDLESSLY LIKE STUNTS (?)."
is designed for beginners.

402
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,556
"THE NAME OF THIS MUSHROOM MONSTER IS ALTARGAIA."
Even Alvin should be

403
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:36,042
"THERE MAY BE NO CHANCE TO CALL IT, BUT REMEMBER THE NAME."
able to make it through.

404
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,254
"APART FROM PAUSING ANIMATION, PLEASE ALSO GO TO"
But he was called

405
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,333
"THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE TO CONFIRM. THAT'S EPISODE FOUR."
a new veteran because…

406
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,042
"STAY TUNED"
Hey, I haven't finished yet…
