1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,667
There are many monsters threatening humans.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,458
Many brave adventurers stepped forward bravely.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,542
And I,

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,542
Alvin, is one of them.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,167
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,417
let's continue the adventure today.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:43,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

8
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,833
THE TITLE. THANKS TO ALTARGAIA
(IT'S THE MUSHROOM'S NAME, PLEASE DON'T FORGET IT),

9
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:55,667
"ALVIN ESCAPED FROM THE PRISON."
Run.

10
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,500
"BUT ANOTHER PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN."
I don't want to be a zombie!

11
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,708
MARIA HAS A BELOVED SISTER, ELLIE.

12
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,458
SOMEHOW IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER.

13
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,958
I WANT TO AVOID THE SPOILER,

14
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,458
BUT IT'S RELATED TO WHY MARIA IS A NECROMANCER.

15
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,000
"DON'T ANTICIPATE UNTIL ANOTHER
LOVELY FEMALE LIKE MARIA SHOWS UP." Let's take a break.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,667
INSTEAD, CARLA SHOWS EVERYONE
HER COSPLAY DRESS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

17
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,042
"PLEASE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS IN EPISODE EIGHT."
I thought I'm doomed.

18
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:12,583
Oh right, thank you for saving me.

19
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,833
It's nothing.

20
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,333
By the way, I got this back for you.

21
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:21,833
But...

23
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:26,125
I didn't expect you're so weak
that you can't even break a cage.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,708
Most people can't break it, okay?

25
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,208
Anyway, you don't seem strong as you are...

26
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:38,167
Sister Carla.

27
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,542
He escaped from prison.

28
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,458
Don't say it in that way.

29
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,083
All right. I'm just kidding.

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,542
It's been tough for you.

31
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,208
Don't say it like I was just out of prison.

32
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Alvin, about turning you into a zombie.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,667
Carla convinced the zombies not to do it.

34
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,167
You convinced them?

35
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,667
Don't get it wrong.

36
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:07,083
I just told them it would bring no good.

37
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,042
So no need to thank me.

38
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:12,375
I think that must be your heartfelt words.

39
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,958
Anyway, I take notice of...

40
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,917
What's that?

41
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:24,292
It's a magic circle to summon
the soul of Miss Maria's sister.

42
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,000
Summon the soul of sister?

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,458
It means your sister... How should I put it...

44
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,583
Never mind.

45
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,667
She's my poor sister.

46
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,792
She was a playful child.

47
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:55,750
I didn't expect she got lost
when playing soul detachment from the body.

48
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,583
What a special way to play...

49
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:02,042
You wandered around graveyards
to search for your sister's soul

50
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,458
because souls are most likely
to gather in graveyards.

51
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,125
The soul can be summoned
when it enters the underworld.

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,125
I wonder if it's lucky.
She's still wandering in the world.

53
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:19,042
Now is the turn of the "omnipotent healer"
who can do summoning magic to appear.

54
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,083
But you don't have the element of a healer.

55
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you sure you can do it...

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,792
What a stupid question. It's easy.

57
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,958
It's chicken soup for me.

58
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,583
It's duck soup.

59
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,083
The whole cake.

60
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,625
It's a piece of cake.

61
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,375
But I can't do it alone.

62
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,833
Miss Maria, please hold my hand.

63
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,958
Hold your hand?

64
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,042
Yes.

65
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,333
Then please think strongly
about your sister's figure.

66
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:48,500
I'll introduce magic into the thoughts
and send them to the magic circle.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,333
If it works, your sister will feel your thoughts
and be summoned.

68
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,250
Meanwhile, Mr. Alvin...

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,042
Is there anything I can help with?

70
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,917
Just stand there and watch.

71
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,458
Is it necessary to tell me that?

72
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,833
Let's begin.

73
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:05,958
Miss Maria.

74
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,125
Okay.

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,208
It's so quiet.

76
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,417
Dark clouds... gather here.

77
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:26,292
Alvin... Look.

78
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,500
Huh?

79
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,333
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

80
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,625
Carla, stop! Open your eyes!

81
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,750
Stop!

82
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm concentrating.

83
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,375
It's not the time for that.

84
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,292
Look at that. Super scary.

85
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,958
What a scary thing you summoned.

86
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,875
What's the fuss...

87
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,625
What's that?

88
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,458
That's what I want to ask.

89
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,625
Miss Maria.

90
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,708
Cheer up.

91
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:24,458
The summon failed. Let's get out of here...

92
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,542
Ellie.

93
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,042
I finally meet you.

94
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,292
Maria.

95
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,042
That's your sister?

96
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:49,833
I took away this beautiful girl's body.

97
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,042
You can't do this.

98
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,000
Holy beam.

99
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,458
It's painful...

100
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,208
What are you doing?

101
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,042
Uh...

102
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:10,417
You evil spirit, get out of Miss Carla's body.

103
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:14,500
What are you doing? Are you listening?

104
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,375
What on earth are you doing?

105
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:26,250
Ellie always wanted to play this game
when she was in spirit form.

107
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,208
Such a bold way to play?

108
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,625
I was the righteous healer.

109
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,542
Carla was the necromancer
possessed by an evil spirit.

110
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:40,042
Ellie was an evil spirit.
That's the evil spirit game.

111
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,542
The right people for the right roles.

112
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:44,250
Do you mean I look like an evil spirit?

113
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,833
No. It's just a compliment.

114
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,625
Please spare my life.

115
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,042
I'm not fit to be a necromancer, right?

116
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,667
-Right?
-I think it's the perfect casting.

117
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,917
PERFECT

118
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,750
All right, Ellie.
If you've had enough, go back to your body.

119
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,958
By the way, where's your sister's body?

120
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,375
I put it there.

121
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,125
I'll "get" it here.

122
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,750
She was travelling
while taking her sister's body?

123
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,833
The soulless body will rot if preservation
magic isn't cast on it from time to time.

124
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,083
I see.

125
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,042
Sorry to keep you waiting.

126
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,958
She's carrying it on her shoulder.

127
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,292
And it looks like she's committing a crime.

128
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,208
Are you just going around with the body?

129
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,667
Ellie is small, so she's light.

130
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,750
That's not what I meant.

131
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,750
I haven't seen my body for long.

132
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,125
This is Miss Ellie's body?

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,458
Who's she?

134
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,708
Who else? Ellie.

135
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,958
That's me.

136
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,375
It's not the same person at all.

137
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,875
The soul will be influenced
by the person's mind and body.

138
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,500
So it looks slightly different.

139
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,292
Your definition of "slightly"
is different from mine.

140
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,958
Okay. I'm going back.

141
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,375
She seems in pain.

142
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,417
Ellie.

143
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:25,292
Probably because she didn't warm up
before going back.

144
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,292
That's not the matter.

145
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,708
Stay back, both of you.

146
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,208
Leave it to me.

147
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,875
I'm going to cast calming magic.

148
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,500
Wrist force.

149
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,542
Okay. She looks much calm.

150
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:43,292
Because she passed out.
You exerted force on her neck with your wrist.

151
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,125
Ellie, wake up.

152
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,000
Ellie.

153
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,542
Am I back in my body?

154
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,833
Yes, you managed to go back in.

155
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,083
It seems she's all right.

156
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,542
Sister Carla, thank you for your help.

157
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,792
Although I felt painful for a moment...

158
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,667
I've gone back in my body.

159
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,792
Is there something wrong with her?

160
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,333
Well, we'll get going.

161
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,625
Thank you for all the help.

162
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,208
Thank you, Sister Carla.

163
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,583
Normally, I can't let a necromancer go.

164
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,833
But I'll let you go this time.

165
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,417
Thank you.

166
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,083
Let me be the healer next time.

167
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,458
Let's return to the village.

168
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:04,958
Oh, right.
We should tell the zombies before going back.

169
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,250
Goodbye.

170
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,625
Come back to the village again.

171
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,375
Let's play together next time.

172
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,917
They're gone.

173
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,458
There's no need to cry.

174
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,958
Because...

175
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,333
It's good that you've made friends.

176
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,583
All right, stop crying. Cheer up.

177
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,542
Yes, you're right.

178
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,792
I've made friends.

179
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:47,667
I've made friends that
Mr. Alvin hasn't managed to.

180
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,958
You'd better cry until death.

181
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,792
Maria is such a good person.

182
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,458
She treats people kindly with a gentle smile.

183
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,625
I think that's a so-called healing girl.

184
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,333
Right, Carla?

185
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,125
I think that's a so-called healing girl.

186
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,042
Why did you say it twice?

187
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,792
I can say it as many times as you want.

188
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:22,958
I think that's a so-called healing...

189
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,167
That's enough. I know what you're trying to say.

190
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:32,125
You don't want to see unprofessional healing

191
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:37,375
but a professional healing girl like me, right?

192
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,708
How did you come out with this?

193
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:45,792
Well. You must have been
under a lot of pressure, Mr. Alvin.

194
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:51,125
Let me do some spiritual healing
for you to relax.

195
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,208
Isn't it great?

196
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:56,167
Stop it.
You're putting a lot of pressure on me now.

197
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:59,167
What is healing for you, Mr. Alvin?

198
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:02,000
Just when you shut your mouth.

199
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,792
Do you mean

200
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,750
I'll just stay quietly by your side?

201
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,417
What a misunderstanding.

202
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,250
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

203
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,167
How can you say such shameful lines
with a straight face?

204
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,208
I didn't say that!

205
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,208
Honestly.

206
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,167
As you said so...

207
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,208
It's gross. I'm going to throw up.

208
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,042
I'm going to be mad.

209
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,833
It's okay.

210
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,833
I managed to bear it.

211
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,042
Safe.

212
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh, yeah? I also managed to bear it.

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,750
Since I'm the one who's healing for Mr. Alvin,

214
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,458
why would you feel stressed?

215
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,708
I don't understand.

216
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,250
Understand it.

217
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,958
Perhaps because you're too familiar
with each other, you got used to it.

218
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,333
It's like getting used to poison.

219
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,375
You were here?

220
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,667
I see. There is no freshness.

221
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,958
Then...

222
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,000
Big brother Alvin.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,833
Eh hey. Eh hey.

224
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,417
Carla is hungry. Eh hey.

225
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:20,542
Buy me a sandwich and some milk. Eh hey.

226
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,583
Stop with that sentence-final particle!

227
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,333
Don't you find it healing?

228
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,833
It's a self-willed little sister.

229
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,750
Apologize to all the little sister characters
out there.

230
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,833
And your acting is trash.

231
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,792
Because you're no longer a brother at your age.

232
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,542
You're right. But that's not the point.

233
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,958
I'll get my last trick up my sleeve.

234
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,583
Is this boring hell still going on?

235
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,333
Take that out.

236
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,500
Roger that.

237
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,875
Turn around before I'm ready.

238
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,542
Okay. I'll just play with you.

239
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:05,208
You can turn around now.

240
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,125
Meow.

241
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,625
How's it? Meow.

242
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,583
It's cats when it comes to healing.

243
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,958
That's cat ears. Meow.

244
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,750
Combine the byword of healing

245
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,125
with me, the healer.

246
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,875
That's 100 times the healing effect. Meow.

247
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,875
"MEOW"
Meow.

248
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,125
Proud.

249
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,875
Change the sentence-final particle to "meow".

250
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,708
That's double the healing effect. Meow.

251
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,542
Where did you get that costume?

252
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,750
I mean. Don't you feel embarrassed wearing that?

253
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,125
Forget it.
If she think it's okay, then it's fine.

254
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,708
Why are you making me wear this?

255
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,958
Meow jerk!

256
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,958
You dressed that yourself!

257
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,000
What's wrong?

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm thinking about you.

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,583
About me? Speaking ill of me?

260
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,208
No.

261
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:18,125
I've just proved that I'm a healing girl.

262
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,792
You're the only one who thinks so.

263
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:25,917
What's the good point of Mr. Alvin,
who has no merit, that I should follow?

264
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,500
I was puzzled by this question.

265
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,625
You're just thinking ill of me.

266
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,250
So have you found my good points?

267
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,042
Before that, talk about my good points.

268
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,042
Why?

269
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,875
If you say "nothing", you'll be punished.

270
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:48,167
I'll talk about your shortcomings.
The whole day.

271
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,000
The whole day?

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,875
But what are your good points
besides your looks?

273
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,583
What did you say?

274
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,750
What? I'm telling the truth.

275
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,125
Say it loudly. Please.

276
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,042
You're easier to deal with than I thought.

277
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,708
It's your turn.

278
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,917
Tell me about my good points.

279
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,375
What's wrong? You can't say "nothing".

280
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,625
What's up? Say it.

281
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,958
You're ignoring me.

282
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,750
You're too desperate that it makes me sad.

283
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,083
I can't bear to watch it.

284
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,708
Say it!

285
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,333
Actually, it's the same answer.

286
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,417
What do you mean?

287
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,167
You mean my looks...

288
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:39,083
Yes, I think it's great.

289
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,667
Thankfully you covered your face. It's great.

290
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,375
Are you speaking ill of me?

291
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,583
It's really fun to be with you.

292
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,333
GLOOMY

293
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,583
What's wrong, Mr. Alvin?

294
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,958
I lost my sword.

295
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,375
Don't sit on my back.

296
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,167
Isn't it the pose
where I'm supposed to sit on?

297
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:21,292
How is that possible? I'm upset now.

298
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,250
Oh. I shouldn't have sat on you.

299
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,792
Phew.

300
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,875
Geez.

301
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,458
Do you remember where you lost it?

302
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:38,583
I still have my sword
when we bid goodbye to Maria and Ellie.

303
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:43,667
You don't know how to use the sword anyway.
It doesn't matter even if you lost it.

304
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,167
I use the sword earnestly.

305
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,417
For warriors, the sword is like our soul.

306
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,875
You lost something so important.

307
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,500
Is this your unique skill?

308
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,542
I'm so mad. You really annoy me.

309
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,458
"UPSET"
I'll buy a new one.

310
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,625
No. Such a waste.

311
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,625
Do you mean it's a waste of money,

312
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,417
or it's a waste that I carry the sword?

313
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,542
Both.

314
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,458
I think so.

315
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,875
Oh right, there's a good thing.

316
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,125
A crystal ball?

317
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:32,042
That's right.
It can tell where the sword was left.

318
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:35,167
You can do divination?

319
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,583
"STUPID QUESTION"
What a stupid question.

320
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,542
It's indeed what you'd ask, Mr. Alvin.

321
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,667
I've seen someone doing it.

322
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,250
"STUPID ANSWER"
Don't reply to me with a stupid answer.

323
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,792
Watch it.

324
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,667
Oh, crystal ball.

325
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:54,667
Please tell me where Mr. Alvin lost his sword.

326
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,250
Hurry.

327
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,083
Up.

328
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,458
Tell me.

329
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,375
Don't rush it.

330
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,833
Because this thing doesn't reply at all.

331
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,917
Don't call the crystal ball a "thing".

332
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:21,833
And how could you do it
since you only saw someone do it before?

333
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,042
Forget it.

334
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,083
I got it.

335
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,625
I must have used it in the wrong way.

336
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,917
Use it like this.

337
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,542
What are you doing?

338
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,167
Go.

339
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,875
Who's going? I'm not a dog.

340
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:47,792
Woof!

341
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:52,542
-Woof! Woof...
-I didn't say you're an outcast.

342
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,917
I didn't either.

343
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,125
Don't throw the crystal ball away
just because it didn't show you anything.

344
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,042
No. Don't you get it?

345
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:03,750
Do you know where the crystal ball dropped?

346
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,458
Who knows?

347
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,250
It should be that way.

348
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,583
That's why I said...

349
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,792
Here's a hint. What did you lose?

350
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,125
Did the crystal ball drop at
where I lost my sword?

351
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,042
-That's right.
-No way.

352
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,208
I'd better buy a new one.

353
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,083
Is it fine with that?

354
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,083
Yes.

355
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,583
Then help me find the crystal ball.

356
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,542
That's expensive.

357
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,958
Then why did you throw it away?

358
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:25,667
NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW. AFTER MARIA AND ELLIE,
THERE WILL ALSO BE FEMALE GUESTS IN THE NEXT EPISODE.

359
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,417
"THIS SHOW SOMETIMES HAS A DIFFERENT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.
IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL." Maria, it was fun.

360
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,750
"BUT FOR THE EPISODE ABOUT MEDUSA AND DRYAD,"
Ellie, the possession game was fun, right?

361
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,542
IT'S RARE TO HAVE SO MANY GIRLS IN ONE EPISODE. WE SHOULD
BROADCAST IT EARLY AND LET THEM APPEAR FOR A FEW EPISODES.

362
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,667
"IT MAY INCREASE A LOT OF POPULARITY. WE INTENDED TO DO SO."
And they let me do the preview.

363
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,750
"BUT IT'LL COST TOO MUCH BUDGET IF WE MAKE A FEW EPISODES."
That's right.

364
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,958
"AND THE OVERALL PROCESS MAY BECOME MESSY. SO FORGET IT."
The title of the preview is very long.

365
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:36,792
"THERE ARE SO MANY PRIVATE STORIES LIKE THIS."
You can do it.

366
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,083
"FINALLY, WE STILL MADE A GOOD EPISODE NINE."
Okay, I'll do my best.

367
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,125
"STAY TUNED."
Hold on, is it really the title...
