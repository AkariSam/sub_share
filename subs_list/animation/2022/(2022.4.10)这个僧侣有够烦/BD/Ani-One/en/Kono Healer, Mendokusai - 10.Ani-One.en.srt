1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,667
There are many monsters threatening humans.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,458
Many brave adventurers stepped forward bravely.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,542
And I,

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,542
Alvin, is one of them.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,167
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,417
let's continue the adventure today.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:43,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

8
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:53,958
THE TITLE "THE SECOND HALF OF THIS EPISODE
FINALLY GETS TO THE CONTENT OF "WHAT'S THIS STORY"."

9
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,417
"(STILL, BUT ONLY THIS TIME AND NEXT TIME.)"
Excuse me.

10
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:56,542
"I'LL EXPLAIN IT AGAIN IN CASE SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW."
Yes.

11
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,042
""WHAT'S THIS STORY" IS THE STORY BEFORE THIS STORY BECAME
"DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER"." Welcome to Adventurer Guild.

12
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,708
THAT'S THE STORY POSTED ON THE ONLINE SUBMISSION WEBSITE
BEFORE SERIALIZATION. ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T BEEN INCLUDED

13
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,667
"IN THE COMIC, YOU MAY READ IT ON THE INTERNET.
PLEASE READ IT ONLINE IF YOU WANT." Hi, Mr. Alvin.

14
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,417
"BUT THERE'S A WICKED CHARACTER IN THE FIRST HALF
THAT YOU CAN'T MISS." It's been a while.

15
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,500
"THE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION IS..."
Miss Carla, you're looking well, too.

16
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,292
YOU'LL KNOW IF YOU CONTINUE TO WATCH IT.
IN SHORT, THERE ARE MANY CONTENTS IN EPISODE TEN.

17
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:12,625
What are you waiting for? Say hello.

18
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,125
Please don't talk to me casually...

19
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,375
All right. Stop it.

20
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,708
Sorry, our goblin is rude.

21
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,542
Not at all. Both of you are interesting as ever.

22
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,500
Why are you coming to our guild today?

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,125
I'm here today to update
the ranking of adventurers.

24
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,625
To update the ranking of adventurers, right?

25
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:37,542
You're thinking, "Do you think you can rank up"
and "bracket laugh", right? How rude.

26
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,167
That's what you think.

27
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,667
I thought,
"do you want to make the ranking worse"

28
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,583
and "bracket laugh".

29
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,792
It's totally different.

30
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,625
Keep murmurs in your mind.

31
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,875
So it's the paper to test the ranking.
Blood will be collected for judgement.

32
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:58,833
The magic array will make a ranking judgement from one star
to five stars based on actual achievement and experience.

33
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,667
Collect blood for judgement.
Are you okay with it, Mr. Alvin?

34
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,208
Just a little cut on the finger.

35
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,750
There's nothing to worry about.

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,792
I'm afraid you'll be "scared to death".

37
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,750
I won't, okay?

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,083
Do you want me to help you make a mistake?

39
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,292
You should help me recover.

40
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:19,708
Mr. Alvin, how many stars
is your current ranking?

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,917
I'm sorry. It must be one star...

42
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,500
Zero.

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,958
The magic array didn't respond at all last time.

44
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,167
So my ranking is zero star.

45
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,250
It's ridiculous, right?

46
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,375
Sorry, I never thought
there was a worse ranking.

47
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,083
How many stars is Carla's ranking?

48
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,333
It's... three stars.

49
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,125
Oh, yeah...

50
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,542
It must have been impossible to judge
when you last updated it on a cloudy day.

51
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:53,500
You can't see stars on cloudy days.
I'm just kidding.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,875
It's like my life that can't see what's ahead.

53
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,500
-It's not funny...
-It's so funny.

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,250
I think... There must be something wrong
with the paper tested.

55
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,083
Yeah, you're just unlucky.

56
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,792
But I did it five times...

57
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,375
Those five pieces of paper are all defective.

58
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,250
Mr. Alvin, you're so unlucky.

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,958
But the worst is the ranking, right?

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,667
Mr. Alvin, I was joking.

61
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,625
I just wanted to lighten the atmosphere.

62
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,375
Please calm down.
The test has nothing to do with blood volume.

63
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,042
Please don't give up on yourself.

64
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:37,417
Even if you don't sacrifice that arm,
there will be a star this time.

65
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,042
We met golem, Cyclops,

66
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:41,417
necromancer and Medusa along the way.

67
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:45,125
We met so many monsters, and you survived.

68
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,542
Is it true?

69
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,792
You fought with so many ferocious monsters,
yet you survived...

70
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,500
Yeah, that's right...

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,250
There will be a star this time.
No, at least four stars.

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,458
Really?

73
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:02,708
Great. Rise to the top adventurer at one go.

74
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,042
No, it's not sure yet.

75
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:11,250
But it makes sense. I have the experience
that common adventurers don't have.

76
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,667
I even think I've been trying hard.

77
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,542
Stop bragging. Just test it.

78
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,667
Don't hurry.

79
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:25,042
Having two stars is also nice, though.

80
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,292
How many stars are there?

81
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,292
Look, Mr. Alvin.

82
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,042
There's a response on the paper.

83
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,375
There must be at least one star.

84
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,708
(LAUGH)

85
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,500
Bracket laugh.

86
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,708
I said it has nothing to do with blood volume.

87
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,125
There must be another way to stop me.

88
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,917
I wonder why it's so noisy. It's you, Alvin.

89
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,417
Amazing. You're still alive.

90
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:04,792
I thought you were killed by a stray dog.

91
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,417
Do you know him?

92
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,125
Kind of.

93
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,375
He's an adventurer like us.

94
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,792
Like you? How ridiculous!

95
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:17,458
Don't compare me to the lowest ranking newbie.

96
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,625
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,750
Leave him alone.
It was just a boring provocation.

98
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,208
You just said Mr. Alvin

99
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:27,167
is a newbie, slug, shameless stray dog,
extra and old man, right?

100
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,208
How mean.

101
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,542
He didn't say so!

102
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,583
Who's this who looks like a fugitive?

103
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,958
A fugitive?

104
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,750
Interesting kid, tell me your name.

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,833
Have you ever heard that you should introduce
yourself first before asking someone's name?

106
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,833
You can't say that
because you're a fugitive, right?

107
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:48,833
You little brat.

108
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,625
Calm down, Brigan.

109
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,292
She bears no ill will.

110
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,167
She just doesn't filter her speech.

111
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,458
-Brigan. I see.
-Our goblin is really rude.

112
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,292
So that's your name.

113
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,542
You have a nice name.

114
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,500
Look. She's telling the truth.

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,417
Prison. What a nice name for a fugitive.

116
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't say it.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,708
Wicked dark elf, are you...

118
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,750
A dark elf dressed as a healer?

119
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,333
And the words that make one angry.

120
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,417
Are you Carla, by any chance?

121
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,500
Right.

122
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,983
"Goddess sent from Heaven", Carla, it's me.

123
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:31,417
You should have just fallen under the ground.

124
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,292
You haven't formed a party, have you?

125
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:37,417
A lot of things... happened.

126
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,958
The party of the notorious "Calamity Mine Carla"

127
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:48,375
and "Walking Luggage" Alvin.

128
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,875
What a masterpiece.

129
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:57,583
Geez. He said it so badly.
Can you stand hearing that, Mr. Alvin?

130
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,417
But he was telling the truth.

131
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:04,583
I was called Calamity Mine Carla.
Can you stand it?

132
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,708
Oh, it's nothing.

133
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,583
I can't stand it.

134
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,250
Why would Mr. Alvin be a walking luggage?

135
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,625
Carla...

136
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,958
Not only you can walk, but you can also talk.

137
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,500
You'd better shut up.

138
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,708
I was complimenting you.

139
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,625
A troublesome guy and a burden.

140
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,917
Best partner.

141
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,750
We're not the best partner, right?

142
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,583
It's slandering.

143
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,583
How about the name of our party
called "waste bin"?

144
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,792
It's disgusting. Why are you so happy?

145
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,667
Waste bin. That's a good name.

146
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,292
You're so talented.

147
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,167
I am, right?

148
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:47,958
And Mr. Brigan is perfect for prison.

149
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,208
You little brat!

150
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:58,875
He suddenly got angry. His EQ is so low.

151
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,250
It's not suddenly.

152
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,875
Instead, I think he has endured it
for a long time.

153
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,375
How dare you look down on me.

154
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,333
You won't know how great I am
if I don't teach you a lesson.

155
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,375
Alvin! Give her to me...

156
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,833
I refuse.

157
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,458
You just mocked me.
Do you think I'm easy as I don't say anything?

158
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,667
Mr. Alvin.

159
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,875
Do you want to fight? How bold of you.

160
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,125
Let's fight outside.

161
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,833
What now?

162
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,667
As I wish, I'm ambitious, too.

163
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,250
But I might get beaten badly.

164
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,833
Please help me recover later.

165
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,542
Got it.

166
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:37,375
What's wrong? You don't dare fight outside?
You wimp.

167
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,125
Shut up. Wash your neck and wait.

168
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,458
Don't run away.

169
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,708
Impossible!

170
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,583
Take advantage!

171
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,875
Brigan.

172
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,917
What did you do?

173
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,708
I saw such an unguarded back.

174
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,125
Without a second thought...

175
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,792
"LEGENDARY WRESTLER, KILLER NUMBER TWO"
Your occupation is an assassin...

176
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,958
"SELF SATISFIED SKILL, VIOLATION ATTACK, ALL SKILLS"
Not this!

177
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,583
"KILLER, SELF SATISFIED SKILL, SURPRISE ATTACK, ALL SKILLS"
Yes, that's it.

178
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,875
Great. You're still alive.

179
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,042
What happened...

180
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,708
Well... I'm sorry.

181
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,792
No. Heal him first.

182
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,458
Just leave it to me.

183
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,000
Why do you tie him up?

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,417
Nice. Got him.

185
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,000
He's not a fugitive.

186
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,458
It's the legendary mansion.

187
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,625
Right.

188
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,125
The cannibal hall occupied
by the resentful ghost.

189
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,500
It seems that the ghost
has to be eliminated here.

190
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,417
We broke the table when we fought with Brigan.

191
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:46,292
We were punished
for causing trouble to the guild.

192
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,292
It looks like an ordinary ruin,

193
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,417
but it brings a terrifying atmosphere.

194
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:55,417
I heard it's also called
"amazing, frightening horror house".

195
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:58,167
It has the vibe of a "leisure facility".

196
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:05,083
But it's said that none of the people
who entered the mansion can come back alive.

197
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:09,667
I think they were killed by the resentful ghost
staying in the mansion.

198
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:13,083
Here it appears.
Settings that often arise in the horror house.

199
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,458
Whatever you think. I'll leave off the rest.

200
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,375
You don't believe?

201
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,333
Who would believe that?

202
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:27,417
It happened suddenly. We have a witness today.

203
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:31,458
I invited someone
who actually entered the mansion.

204
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,625
No, it's supposed that
no one will come back alive.

205
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,042
Witness, please.

206
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,875
Hello, everyone.

207
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,542
The ghost appeared.

208
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,250
This is Miss Anna, the former thief

209
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,167
killed by the resentful ghost

210
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,375
shortly after entering the mansion.

211
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,292
A round of applause.

212
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,375
Carla, no. It's embarrassing.

213
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,375
No. I've got to introduce you.

214
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,292
But you said, "killed shortly after".
Doesn't that mean I'm a bad thief?

215
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,083
But you're really dead.

216
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,292
No, that resentful ghost was terrible.

217
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,792
"GET RIGHT TO FT"
What's that guy doing?

218
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,417
Hold on. You were here!

219
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:05,917
Where have you been?

220
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:11,042
I helped Sister Carla find the crystal ball.
Then I got lost.

221
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,333
It was over.

222
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,125
Really...

223
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:19,667
Let's not stand here. Go inside and talk.

224
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,417
It's freezing today, after all.

225
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,250
Do ghosts feel cold?

226
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,000
Wait, wait, wait!

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What's the matter? We're going to enter
the mansion and throw dice with written themes.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,500
Then follow the topic and chat...

229
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Heart-pounding conversation...

230
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,083
How annoying!

231
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,917
Do you want to join the girls' talk?

232
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,250
Can a 30-year-old man keep up?

233
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,333
Why do you know my ag... No.

234
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,333
This mansion is dangerous, right?

235
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,625
Why do we just go in?

236
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,417
You should ask her more and be prepared.

237
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,333
Are you...

238
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,083
No way.

239
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,792
What? I'm not afraid...

240
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,958
Speak properly!

241
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,292
First of all, I'm really not afraid.

242
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,792
It's okay. Everyone is bad at something.

243
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,083
What's more, the resentful ghost
is related to "death".

244
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,333
It's normal for a living person to fear "death".

245
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,625
I said that's not it!

246
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,417
All right. Here's the problem.

247
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,708
The natural enemy who's called
a resentful ghost receives divine protection.

248
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,708
They look so pitiful
that people want to protect them.

249
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,958
Who's the beautiful cleric
with silver hair and brown skin?

250
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,083
Correct.

251
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,333
What are you trying to say?

252
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,917
All right. I've got the strategy
for dealing with resentful ghost.

253
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:58,792
Let's go and solve the task.

254
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,417
What's wrong? What makes you uneasy?

255
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:08,167
It's you who makes me feel the most uneasy.

256
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:12,875
Don't worry. I'm protected by the divine.

257
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:17,333
Maybe it's plausible.

258
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:24,833
Even if I can't persuade it, I'll use
the iron fist of fraternity to make it obedient.

259
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,125
Is iron fist even a fraternity...

260
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,792
Welcome ba...

261
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,833
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry, I'm a useless healer.

262
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,667
I appreciate you form a party with me,

263
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,417
but I also feel guilty.

264
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,542
Oh, no. She's talking nonsense out of fear.

265
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,458
Someone like me who's mischievous and useless

266
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,542
should stay at home and live gloomily.

267
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,708
Don't say so!

268
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,625
Don't worry.
I forgive you for everything so far.

269
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,958
So please keep it that way, Carla.

270
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:58,833
Please!

271
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,958
SINCERE

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,667
You're so generous.

273
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,750
You're gentle and tolerant.

274
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,083
Just...

275
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,125
Just like me.

276
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,208
Geez. She recovered.

277
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,750
I was too careless.

278
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,917
I didn't expect it to be so exciting at first.

279
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,375
Yeah.

280
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,208
The resentment is so strong that
even I'm affected.

281
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,958
It seems that it's hard to deal with.

282
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,000
And...

283
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,792
Someone sacrificed again
because I was caught off guard.

284
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:34,375
Things are getting more and more troublesome.

285
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:38,167
Isn't resurrection magic useful
to the resentful ghost?

286
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,542
A newbie who doesn't know magic
is a pain in the neck.

287
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,500
Resurrection magic is super difficult magic.

288
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,458
It's not magic that can be used
whenever and wherever.

289
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,250
I can do it, though.

290
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,625
You can do it?

291
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,333
But I'm not proficient at it.

292
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:58,042
It can bring someone back to life
who's just died for three seconds.

293
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,042
Three seconds...

294
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,625
But at least she can do it.

295
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,833
However,

296
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,167
the chant required for resurrection magic

297
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,958
will take ten seconds.

298
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,500
You can't make it!

299
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,958
If I guess correctly that
"this person will die", I can chant early.

300
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,917
You should do something
to prevent people from dying.

301
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:20,417
Forget it. Let's go back.

302
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,250
Could you please wait a minute?

303
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,792
What?

304
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,042
The resentful ghost seemed to say something.

305
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,458
He said "welcome back".

306
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,708
That's right.

307
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,125
So what?

308
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,792
How should I put it?

309
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,708
We met for the first time.
It's shameless to say so.

310
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,375
You really are...

311
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,833
I'm supposed to be the natural enemy
of the resentful ghost.

312
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,250
But he said to me, "welcome back, star."
He must be looking down on me.

313
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,333
He's not that friendly.

314
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:52,750
Anyway, the resentful ghost made me
feel frustrated for the first time.

315
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,625
I'm a woman who'll take an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

316
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,625
I'll make that resentful ghost wear cat ears
and dress as a maid.

317
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,833
And say, "welcome back, meow, star."

318
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,958
What an unnecessary counterattack.

319
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,417
Don't worry. I won't mess around.

320
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:10,458
I'll let it wear cat ears and dress as a maid.

321
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,083
I don't understand why we're here.

322
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,667
Excuse me, Zanko!

323
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,458
How you open the door!

324
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,958
Come out.

325
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,792
Let me teach you the etiquette of
greeting someone you meet for the first time.

326
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,417
How boastful of someone
who doesn't know how to open the door.

327
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,750
You... You come out.

328
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,417
You just made me embarrassed.

329
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,375
But it's not going to be easy this time.

330
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,250
Open your eyes. Don't face me.

331
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,417
-Carla!
-Wh... What's wrong? Are you trying to scare me?

332
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:43,708
Look behind you.

333
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,792
I won't be scared anymore.

334
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,708
But don't scare me from behind...

335
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,083
Welcome back, meow!

336
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,583
What a mess.

337
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,875
Not... Not bad.

338
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,667
It looks plausible.

339
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:59,417
Not at all!

340
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,417
No redeeming qualities.

341
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,083
I can't feel your intention at all.

342
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,458
Even if you get changed,
you still don't change your mind.

343
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:11,250
When she knows it's plausible,
she suddenly becomes bold.

344
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,375
What a long face.

345
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,583
In this era, what we all crave
is the healing given by the maid.

346
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,833
Don't act like a cleric.

347
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,875
The feeling of sincerely serving others

348
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,958
is more healing than any recovery magic.

349
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,083
It can be said to be the ultimate healing magic.

350
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:30,875
You can't heal just by dressing up as a maid.

351
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,750
There's a healer who can't heal others.

352
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,833
But...

353
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:42,667
It's really difficult for the resentful ghost
to pursue healing.

354
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,417
All right. I got it.

355
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:52,708
This time, me "healing specialist"
is shortened to "heal-cialist".

356
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,083
It's so hard to read.

357
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,792
Let me teach you the true secret of healing.

358
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:57,875
Really?

359
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:02,333
The training is very strict and hard.
Can you do it?

360
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,750
OK.

361
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,083
So easy.

362
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:05,833
100 PUSH UPS, 200 SIT UPS

363
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,542
"VOICE PRACTICE TEN MINUTES, SQUAT TEN TIMES (TWO GROUPS)"
Carla made a list of

364
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,958
"CARLA AMAZING 100 TIMES"
extremely difficult special training.

365
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:15,833
Although the list is made, it's not mandatory.

366
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,292
Anyway, it's okay to smile.

367
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,375
All right.

368
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,625
I don't know what she said for five minutes.

369
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,250
Then...

370
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,000
It's done. Yeah.

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,792
I don't think anything has changed...
No. Is he a little twisted?

372
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:34,417
Do it the way I taught you.

373
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,792
Have you taught it the way?

374
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,417
Wel... Wel...

375
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:43,208
Welcome... Welcome...

376
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,625
-Ba... ba... ck... ck...
-Is that all right? It seems a little bad.

377
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,833
Meow.

378
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,000
What?

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
No. Hold up, hold up.

380
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,875
Who are you?

381
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,500
Who? What are you talking about?

382
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,000
She's the resentful ghost.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,958
She has been here.

384
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,167
No way.

385
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,750
"BEFORE AFTER"
She was another creature just now.

386
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,667
Oh, well. What creature?

387
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,750
She's already dead.

388
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,750
That's not the point!

389
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,250
But I know why you're so surprised.

390
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,708
And I understand you want to compliment me.

391
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,875
I'm glad you applauded me.

392
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,750
But please calm down. Everyone, sit down.

393
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,500
No one stands up and applauds, okay?

394
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,542
One must purify the mind of the successor
before inheriting the "healing mystery".

395
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:33,583
Hold it.
Then you don't inherit the mystery, do you?

396
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,042
Because your mind is very filthy.

397
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,750
The argument is pointless.

398
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,958
As a result, as you can see, the body and mind
of the resentful ghost have been purified.

399
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,667
Don't ignore me.

400
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,708
We didn't just talk.

401
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,250
By the way, let her express
her dissatisfaction, pressure and troubles.

402
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,708
A psychosomatic clinic?

403
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,292
Therefore, the seeds of her anxiety and worry
were carefully resolved by me.

404
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,625
Doesn't this pose appear too often?

405
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:03,917
Yes, just like... Like a god of death
who ends the lives of living people.

406
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,667
I'm sick of your words.

407
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,875
Hang on a second.

408
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,375
You're alive. No, you're dead.

409
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,417
Thank you for helping me just now.

410
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,750
No!

411
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,667
She becomes lovely after being purified...

412
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,792
She's a ghost, but she's so lovely.

413
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,167
She has the same character as me.

414
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:25,458
Why would you say that to the person
who killed you?

415
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,458
Wait a minute!

416
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,625
I won't turn my status as the lovely mascot
over to anyone.

417
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,667
Nobody thinks so, okay?

418
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,542
Hold on. Speaking of lovely mascot...

419
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,000
Shut up!

420
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:44,750
Speaking of cute character...

421
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,333
-Just shut up!
-It must be me.

422
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:25,625
NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW "THE SECOND PART
OF "WHAT'S THIS STORY" MAKES ANNA AND RYOKO,"

423
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,792
"WHO AREN'T IN THE ORIGINAL WORK
"DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER"," That's great, Ryoko.

424
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,292
"ACTIVE IN THE ANIMATION. IT'S EXCITING."
We made our debut in animation.

425
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,042
"THANK YOU FOR MAKING UP THE INSUFFICIENT PART
OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IN THE ANIMATION." That's right.

426
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:29,750
"ON THE OTHER HAND, A POPULAR ANIMATION
APPEARED IN THIS EPISODE." Anna.

427
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,083
"I BELIEVE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WITHOUT
EXPLAINING IT." We're not even in business books.

428
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,167
"IN THOSE DAYS, INSTEAD OF USING A DIGITAL BRUSH,"
And since the next episode,

429
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,167
"REAL DRAWING TOOLS"
we're fixed characters.

430
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,375
"WERE USED TO DRAW OUTLINES AND COLOUR."
It's like a dream.

431
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,292
"IT MAY BE GOOD TO LET PEOPLE KNOW"
Let's work hard together.

432
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,583
"THAT THE STAFF BACK THEN REALLY WORKED HARD AND"
Heat up the show.

433
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,167
"HAD BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT ANIMATION. THAT'S EPISODE 11."
Only two episodes left.

"STAY TUNED."
