1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,667
There are many monsters threatening humans.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,458
Many brave adventurers stepped forward bravely.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,542
And I,

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,542
Alvin, is one of them.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,167
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,417
let's continue the adventure today.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:43,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

8
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,708
THE TITLE "AFTER MARIA AND ELLIE,
THERE WILL ALSO BE FEMALE GUESTS IN THE NEXT EPISODE."

9
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,250
"THIS SHOW SOMETIMES HAS A DIFFERENT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER."
Found

10
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,792
"IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL."
the crystal ball.

11
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:00,375
"BUT FOR THE EPISODE ABOUT MEDUSA AND DRYAD, IT'S RARE TO
HAVE SO MANY GIRLS IN ONE EPISODE." But it's not the sword.

12
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,625
"WE SHOULD BROADCAST IT EARLY AND LET THEM APPEAR FOR A FEW
EPISODES. IT MAY INCREASE A LOT" It's a statue of a goddess.

13
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,458
"OF POPULARITY. WE INTENDED TO DO SO. BUT IT'LL COST
TOO MUCH BUDGET IF WE MAKE A FEW EPISODES." I think so...

14
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,042
"AND THE OVERALL PROCESS MAY BECOME MESSY. SO FORGET IT."
My crystal ball is broken.

15
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,917
"THERE ARE SO MANY PRIVATE STORIES LIKE THIS."
Because it hit the head of the statue.

16
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,042
"FINALLY, WE STILL MADE A GOOD EPISODE NINE."
What should we do?

17
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,208
Will we be cursed?

18
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,750
A cleric can't be afraid of curses.

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,750
A cleric wouldn't say something like that.

20
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,083
Who's that?

21
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,667
A monster.

22
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you the ones who broke my seal?

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,667
A seal?

24
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,250
Thank you.

25
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,250
In this way, I can engulf the humans with fear.

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,458
Wicked monster.

27
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,583
What's wrong?

28
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,458
She said that stuff. Let's kill her.

29
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,375
This can indeed maintain world peace.

30
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,292
No. The way she spoke pisses me off.

31
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,917
-Just personal emotion.
-Yes.

32
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,667
But I lost my sword.

33
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,292
Look.

34
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:55,708
She was sealed in such a small cave.

35
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,292
She must be tiny and weak.

36
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:00,250
Maybe she'll be squashed when we step on her.

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,125
Are we really going to do it?

38
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,583
If anything happens,
I'll cover you with Tetsuzanko.

39
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,292
Okay. I'll beat you for world peace.

40
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,375
Come out!

41
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,542
We'll smash your mouth.

42
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:15,750
How suicidal you are.

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,708
Over there.

44
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:22,708
I just woke up.
Let me improve my skills with you.

45
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,875
No problem. Come out.

46
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,333
How vigorous.

47
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,042
Do you think you can beat me?

48
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,917
Let's fight!

49
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,625
What monster is that? She's not tiny at all.

50
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,792
What are you doing?

51
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,750
Mr. Alvin, be careful.

52
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,125
She's Medusa.

53
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,625
Me... Medusa.

54
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,292
She'll turn you into a stone
if you look at her eyes.

55
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,125
I know.

56
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,917
Listen. Never look at her eyes.

57
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,958
I got it.

58
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,458
Never. Never do that.

59
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,333
You're so annoying.

60
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,500
Never look at her.

61
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,500
Peek.

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,583
You looked.

63
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,292
Oh, n...

64
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,750
Mr. Alvin.

65
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,667
Is he a fool?

66
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,167
I'm responsible for him.

67
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,625
No, he should be responsible for himself.

68
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,708
No, I should have noticed that.

69
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:39,500
I kept warning him.
Instead, he might pretend not to hear me.

70
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,917
What's wrong with your thought patterns?

71
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,542
Forget it. Turn the girl into a stone too.

72
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,375
Anyway, Mr. Alvin.

73
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,875
What kind of ordinary posture is this?

74
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,333
No matter how I see you,
you look like something on the roadside...

75
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,500
Who's the stone on the roadside?

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,417
I didn't say so.

77
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,542
-But you were going to.
-Yes.

78
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,542
What an unpleasant answer.

79
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,625
How could he break the petrification?

80
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,792
Right. Why?

81
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:08,625
You...

82
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,000
Once again.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,083
I won't make the same mistake twice.

84
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,958
Hey, look at me.

85
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,625
What kind of fool would look at you
knowing that you'd turn him into a stone?

86
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,958
Mr. Alvin.

87
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,500
Look at me. Just look at me.

88
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,583
Mr. Alvin, you made a girl cry.

89
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,583
Bad man.

90
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,375
You don't have to cry...

91
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,375
You fool!

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,458
Mr. Alvin.

93
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,417
It works this time.

94
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,625
What's wrong with you?

95
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,500
Break the petrification
like how you did just now.

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,542
Do it again.

97
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,542
Break the petrification
with a "pop" like that just now.

98
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:48,000
Please.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,083
Okay? Okay?

100
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,208
Mr. Alvin.

101
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,542
Do you think it's fun?

102
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,167
How could you break the petrification?

103
00:05:57,167 --> 00:06:00,750
Why? Why doesn't it work for you?

104
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,208
My strength is completely useless.

105
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,125
Crocodile tears again. I won't be tricked.

106
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:15,208
You must be upset when your identity is denied.

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,208
Like Mr. Alvin, there's nothing left
when he takes off his armour.

108
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,167
There's my body left.

109
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:25,875
Miss Medusa, don't get frustrated so easily.

110
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:30,875
You just haven't got your strength back
because you were sealed.

111
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,458
Is that so?

112
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,875
That's right.

113
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,750
Come on. Keep your head up and chest out.

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,333
You're Medusa, the legendary monster.

115
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,542
In this situation...

116
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,208
Yes.

117
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,708
You're right.

118
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,458
I'll do my best!

119
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,292
I knew it!

120
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,292
So you can't use petrification
without making a "hah" sound.

121
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,417
If everything I look at will be petrified,
it'll affect my life.

122
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,458
Affect your life?

123
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,667
Like this?

124
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,917
Hands like this.

125
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,917
She's not defensive at all.

126
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,167
Mr. Alvin.

127
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,833
What's going on?

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,792
I sensed the smell of evil.
So I come to find out.

129
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:31,333
You're the tree spirit, Dryad.

130
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:36,917
It's you, Medusa, as I expected.

131
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,500
I'm the guardian of this forest.

132
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,042
Oh humans, you liberated Medusa.
What a sinful thing.

133
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,458
Wait. I wasn't the one who broke the seal...

134
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,083
Are you making excuses?

135
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,042
Shut up, you culprit.

136
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:54,042
I found this near the destroyed statue.

137
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,750
Is it yours?

138
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,708
My crystal ball.

139
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,833
Evidence here.

140
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,750
You must compensate me. I'm angry.

141
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,625
Are you an obnoxious guest monster?

142
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,417
I see. You're the one
who broke the seal of the statue.

143
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,417
Do you know what you've done?

144
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,458
What have I done again?

145
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:20,083
A long time ago, Medusa brought infinite fear
to many villages.

146
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,917
But you broke her seal.

147
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,542
You were amazing.

148
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,833
I was impulsive when I was young.

149
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,625
It seems you're getting tamer.

150
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:38,042
It seems Medusa's power becomes weaker.

151
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,583
Now is a good chance.

152
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:44,083
You have to take responsibility
for defeating Medusa.

153
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,167
She's talking about you. Don't look at me.

154
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:52,083
Before that, let Mr. Alvin go first.

155
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,708
I'm sad looking at it.

156
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,042
Carla...

157
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,417
It seems you don't want to see your partner
being humiliated.

158
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,458
Then defeat Medusa first.

159
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,917
Really. Why don't you get it?

160
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:12,375
I mean, I don't want to see a man
in his thirties being hung in a bondage play.

161
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,917
Don't mention bondage play.
It makes me embarrassed.

162
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:19,792
This should be my duty as a beautiful girl.

163
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,542
Then switch with me. It must fit you very well.

164
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,167
That's sexual harassment.

165
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,458
Are you kidding me?

166
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,292
Look. She's getting mad. Very angry.

167
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:31,875
Bondage play on a middle-aged man

168
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,750
is so great, okay?

169
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,417
Miss Dryad?

170
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,042
But only for handsome men, right?

171
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,708
What are you arguing about?

172
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,917
I think ugly men make me more excited instead.

173
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:44,583
How's that?

174
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,792
Don't tell us your fetish.

175
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,583
Calm down, both of you.

176
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,667
Only Medusa is more normal. What a hell.

177
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:55,958
For me, it's great to flirt with young boys.

178
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,875
Young boy complex, don't join the argument.

179
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,958
Mr. Alvin doesn't match the criteria.
Let him go.

180
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,875
I haven't seen his looks. I can't agree.

181
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,042
I like baby faces, too.

182
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,833
These women...

183
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,625
Then let's see the answer.

184
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,667
Stop! What are you doing?

185
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,167
Weren't we talking about defeating Medusa?

186
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,792
Why did it turn out like this...

187
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,833
Hey, say something.

188
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,875
At least tell me how you feel about seeing me.

189
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,583
Boring.

190
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,292
Not interesting.

191
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,250
A face I'd forget in two hours.

192
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,083
Sorry for not meeting your expectations!

193
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,958
Sorry. It was my fault.

194
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,750
I'm sorry for asking you
to defeat the vicious Medusa.

195
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,958
No. I'm accountable for this as well.

196
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,333
About 1%.

197
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:02,583
If you had told me earlier,
I would be able to respond as soon as possible.

198
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,625
I didn't expect him to be so weak...

199
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:10,125
I heard that petrifaction doesn't work for him.
I thought you could defeat Medusa.

200
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,000
It seems that I'm too naive.

201
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,417
My strength hasn't been recovered yet.
And I was ready to fight hard.

202
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,042
Let me say a few words.

203
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,708
Mr. Alvin.

204
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,458
The loser doesn't have the right to speak, okay?

205
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,167
It's too strict.

206
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,792
Listen. I'm weak indeed.

207
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:28,958
That's right.

208
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,708
But don't look at me like this.

209
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,958
I do heavy training and sword practice
every day.

210
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,333
And?

211
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,125
But I didn't win this time.

212
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,667
Why is it?

213
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,167
One, two, three.

214
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,250
Why?

215
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,458
Shut up.

216
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,708
There's only one reason.

217
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,083
That's because I don't have a sword now.

218
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,417
You don't have to be quiet now.

219
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,958
I don't think it's a matter of the sword.

220
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,792
And why doesn't he have a sword?
Isn't he a warrior?

221
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,708
Could he be a suspicious person in armour?

222
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,000
Armour is his funny signature point.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,250
I heard it, especially what Carla said.

224
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,208
There's one if you need a sword.

225
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:11,083
Deep in the forest, there's a holy sword
inserted on the platform.

226
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,542
A holy sword?

227
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,208
Many adventurers tried
to pull out the holy sword.

228
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,833
But no one made it.

229
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:25,000
When I know that you broke the seal of Medusa,

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is it chance or luck?

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,333
maybe it's the moment
for the holy sword to be pulled out.

232
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,250
Go ahead. It's inside.

233
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,125
That's...

234
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,000
the legendary...

235
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,458
holy sword.

236
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,875
It's inserted the wrong way.

237
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,125
Hero, please pull out the sword.

238
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,333
It's so hard.

239
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,917
Usually, the handle is placed above.

240
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:58,333
Alvin, do you hear me?

241
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,917
Alvin.

242
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:03,542
-Do you hear my voice?
-What's that sound?

243
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,792
Could it be...

244
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:08,042
I'm the holy sword.

245
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:09,917
Are you really the holy sword?

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,958
Alvin, the hero.

247
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,625
I've been waiting for you.

248
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,792
I'm the hero. Really?

249
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:21,458
Yes. You're the chosen hero.

250
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,625
Hero chosen in a raffle.

251
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,875
-A raffle...
-Use your hands...

252
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,083
Huh.

253
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,167
The voice seems to slow down…

254
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,208
Nonsense!

255
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,458
Geez. It was your voice.

256
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,000
I anticipated it. What a shame.

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,375
I'm sorry. Sorry.

258
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,042
I just wanted you to have a dream.

259
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,875
When can I wake up from this nightmare?

260
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,250
Let's pull out the sword first.

261
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,042
That's right.

262
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:53,208
I know I can't, but I'll give it a try.

263
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,292
It should be hard to pull this out.

264
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,917
I can only grab the blade with both hands.

265
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,625
What's wrong?

266
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,625
I feel like I can pull it out.

267
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,458
Is it mistaken belief?

268
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,542
It should be a mistaken belief.

269
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:09,833
Is it your mistaken belief?

270
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,292
You're the ones who have it.

271
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:15,333
Geez. I'll pull it out and show you.

272
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,583
Is he really the chosen one?

273
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,417
When did you sign up?

274
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,625
I didn't.

275
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:32,792
He pulled it out!

276
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,042
You're really the chosen one!

277
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,125
No. Look carefully.

278
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,542
MISSED

279
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:41,625
Missed.

280
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,708
What?

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,417
Great. You got the sword.

282
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,750
Missed sword.

283
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,000
You must think it suits me anyway.

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,875
Just laugh if you want to.

285
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,000
What? Can I? Thank you.

286
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,458
Forget it. Don't laugh.

287
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,958
Smile is my merit. How mean.

288
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,292
Rethink your self introduction.

289
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,792
What's left on me after taking off my smile?

290
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:12,750
The feeling of being beaten.

291
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,125
Honestly. What's wrong with you?

292
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,542
Pull yourself together.

293
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:23,667
Mr. Alvin already has a prize named Carla,
after all.

294
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,958
How shy.

295
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,500
Food poisoning is better than you.

296
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,792
Now that you have the sword

297
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:32,833
let's look at the result of your daily training.

298
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,833
Don't think you can defeat me with the sword.

299
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,083
Mr. Alvin, you're being looked down on.

300
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:45,083
I believe you. The daily training is useless.

301
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,458
Do you know you're making things worse?

302
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,292
Don't worry. I'll support you.

303
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,917
Now I'm more worried.

304
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:57,208
Two versus one? That's a good concession.

305
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,542
He's the one to give in.

306
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,625
Look at him.

307
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,792
I can't listen to it anymore.

308
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:06,333
Although I'm weak,
you didn't do your duty as a defender.

309
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,375
You'd only say that.

310
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,250
Again.

311
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,667
Is their relationship good or bad?

312
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,250
Magic I'm going to use this time.

313
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:22,167
Increase defense magic.

314
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,542
Your every move pisses me off.

315
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,500
Just use this magic.

316
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,417
Look. Just like this.

317
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:32,583
Like what? You were just clapping your hands.

318
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,500
Hold on. What are you doing?

319
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,333
What are you...

320
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,042
Look. It doesn't hurt, right?

321
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,958
But my mind is hurt.

322
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,292
Your body isn't injured at all, right?

323
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:53,417
It's all thanks to magic.

324
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,083
It really doesn't hurt.

325
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,500
Companions will not hit hard.

326
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,625
Let me give it a try.

327
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,875
Why?

328
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,333
Take off your armour, anyway.
Lie on the ground like a dog.

329
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,250
Then it's me. My turn.

330
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean why...

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,333
Harry!

332
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,708
I'm not a chair.

333
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,417
Let's begin.

334
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,625
One more time.

335
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,958
It's not over yet.

336
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,375
Go on.

337
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,292
How is it? Say that it feels nice.

338
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,875
Miss Dryad. Stop!

339
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,583
Is it as painful as you imagined?

340
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,333
There's something wrong with your imagination.

341
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,417
It seems he doesn't feel anything.

342
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,292
It's boring.

343
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,417
Stop it. It sounds like something else.

344
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,250
Next is my turn.

345
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,542
But this magic is awesome.
It doesn't hurt at all.

346
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,458
Right?

347
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,125
What? So you can cast normal magic.

348
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,042
Sexual harassment.

349
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,542
It'd be nice if you had a better personality.

350
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,375
It's my turn. My turn.

351
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm not a sandbag.

352
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,292
Forget it. Thanks to Carla's magic,
I can finally fight you this time.

353
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,042
And I have a sword in my hand.

354
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,792
You have to hurry up.

355
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:08,333
When the magic loses its effect,
it'll backfire twice the harm.

356
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,417
Or ten times?

357
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,542
It's my turn!

358
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It tastes good.

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,125
It's delicious.

360
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,833
Great. It suits your taste.

361
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,208
I made the cake using the fruits
from this forest.

362
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,667
You have a terrible fetish, but you're feminine.

363
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,917
What a noisy reptile.

364
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:47,625
It's like the smell of a flower blooming
next to a wind god surrounded by a group

365
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:54,917
of vegetable insects in a temple built to blow
the cursed land and stop the miasma storm.

366
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,833
Is that a compliment?

367
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,917
Oh, right. Is Mr. Alvin okay?

368
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,375
He'll wake up soon.

369
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,292
Because I drew the holy recovery
magic array for him.

370
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,583
Thank you for lending me your room, Miss Dryad.

371
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,292
You're welcome. It's also a kind of fate.

372
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:19,667
This girl party is really a strange fate.

373
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:24,583
Speaking of fate,
why did Carla team up with Alvin?

374
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,833
How should I put it?

375
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:30,375
The vanguard is such a weak warrior. What's
the advantage of forming a party with him?

376
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,833
I know he's nice.

377
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,667
But it's a little troublesome
with him as a teammate.

378
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,375
I didn't expect you two to live to this day.

379
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:44,500
Sorry, I'm not talking ill of your partner.

380
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,250
Can I have another piece of cake?

381
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,750
Okay.

382
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,083
I know what you're trying to say.

383
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:55,417
But Mr. Alvin has many good points, such as

384
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,833
he won't be ashamed
of the title "The Weakest King of Loser".

385
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,875
He should feel ashamed of it.

386
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,542
For instance...

387
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,958
Can't you think of the first one?

388
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,667
-Pathetic.
-You're speaking ill of him.

389
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,208
-Miserable.
-This too.

390
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,250
-Poor.
-This as well.

391
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,542
That's not it.

392
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,458
You'd better say nothing.

393
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,250
I feel happy when I'm with him.

394
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,750
What are you talking about?

395
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,000
You... didn't scare me. Not at all.

396
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,333
You look very shocked.

397
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,000
Did you hear what we said?

398
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,667
No, I only heard your voices.

399
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,542
We were talking about you.

400
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,833
About me?

401
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,042
Speaking ill of me, anyway.

402
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:51,750
Something like pathetic, miserable and poor.

403
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,292
All correct.

404
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,125
But Carla also said...

405
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,833
You scared me. What's wrong?

406
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,708
There was a shooting star just now.

407
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,333
It's indoor.

408
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,292
Sorry. Please say it again.

409
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,417
You're so noisy.

410
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,875
Wow. Shooting star.

411
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,667
Even if you speak English, it's still indoor.

412
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:17,583
What's wrong? Is there something I can't hear?

413
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,583
Nothing.

414
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,417
Then keep quiet.

415
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,625
So what exactly have you said?

416
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,375
Well...

417
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,542
Sorry. I suddenly forgot it.

418
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:33,042
You forgot it as soon as it was said?

419
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,583
I remember it clearly.

420
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,500
-Stop it.
-Alvin, listen.

421
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,333
Carla thinks when she's with you...

422
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,167
A... Choo!

423
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,167
Oh, no. I just sneezed.

424
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:50,000
Who'd sneeze and use Tetsuzanko
at the same time?

425
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,042
STILL TEN YEARS EARLY

426
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,917
"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW"
Title of the next episode...

427
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:27,750
"THE SECOND HALF OF THIS EPISODE FINALLY GETS
TO THE CONTENT OF "WHAT'S THIS STORY"." Dryad!

428
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,750
"(STILL, BUT ONLY THIS TIME AND NEXT TIME.)
I'LL EXPLAIN IT AGAIN IN CASE SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW." Me too.

429
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,708
""WHAT'S THIS STORY" IS THE STORY BEFORE THIS STORY BECAME
"DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER"." I want to report the title too.

430
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,375
"THAT'S THE STORY POSTED ON THE ONLINE SUBMISSION WEBSITE
BEFORE SERIALIZATION. ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T BEEN" Medusa.

431
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,792
"INCLUDED IN THE COMIC, YOU MAY READ IT ON THE INTERNET.
PLEASE READ IT ONLINE IF YOU WANT." Don't bother me.

432
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:32,833
"BUT THERE'S A WICKED CHARACTER IN THE FIRST HALF THAT YOU
CAN'T MISS. THE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD" Go away.

433
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,375
"PAY ATTENTION IS... YOU'LL KNOW IF YOU CONTINUE
TO WATCH IT. IN SHORT," Play "hah" by yourself.

434
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,958
"THERE ARE MANY CONTENTS IN EPISODE TEN. STAY TUNED."
I don't want to.

435
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,542
-Let me do it too.
-You're annoying.

436
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:40,125
-Let's report the title together.
-I myself...
