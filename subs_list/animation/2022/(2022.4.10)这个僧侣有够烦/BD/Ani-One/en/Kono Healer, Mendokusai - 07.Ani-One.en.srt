1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,667
There are many monsters threatening humans.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,458
Many brave adventurers stepped forward bravely.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,542
And I,

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,542
Alvin, is one of them.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,167
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,417
let's continue the adventure today.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:43,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

8
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,583
THE TITLE "THERE'S NO OTHER MAJOR FEMALE ROLE
EXCEPT CARLA IN DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER."

9
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,042
IN A WAY, IT'S A SPECIAL SHOW.
AFTER EPISODE 5, THE WITCH AND THE ROBBER GIRL APPEARED.

10
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,958
"BUT THE YOUNG-LOOKING WITCH ONLY APPEARED
FOR A WHILE AT THE END." Today is also a peaceful day.

11
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,083
AND THE ROBBER GIRL WILL NOT APPEAR AGAIN. IT'S TIME TO LET
THE NEW FEMALE ROLE APPEAR TO MEET EVERYONE'S PREDICTIONS

12
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,333
"AND EXPECTATIONS. SORRY TO KEEP EVERYONE WAITING."
It's too peaceful.

13
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,667
"THERE'LL BE A NEW FEMALE ROLE THIS TIME. MARIA DESFREM."
It's hard for me to level up.

14
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,500
"BUT ENJOY THE ZOMBIE STORY FIRST."
Where are the monsters?

15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,625
"WILL IT MEET EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS?"
Weak ones?

16
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,917
"PLEASE LOOK FORWARD TO EPISODE SEVEN."
You're so annoying.

17
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,125
That's...

18
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,042
Someone fell to the ground.

19
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,875
Was he attacked by a monster?

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,583
Mr. Alvin, hurry up.

21
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,333
We've got to bury him.

22
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,250
It's way too early.

23
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,750
Don't assume someone is dead
without confirming the situation.

24
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,875
He must be dead lying down there.

25
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,875
You haven't checked yet.

26
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,208
Okay. So we need to check first?

27
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
Of course.

28
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,667
Can we bury him after that?

29
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,208
It depends on the result.

30
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:50,792
Cremation or burial after confirming the result?

31
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:53,667
Think about the possibility
that he's still alive.

32
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,375
Forget it. I'll check myself.

33
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,583
Stop! Hold on a minute.

34
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,750
What? You're here?

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,500
It's dangerous to touch strangers.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,542
Some monsters will take advantage of humans.

37
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:14,667
You can't guarantee that he's a human.

38
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:15,833
It makes sense.

39
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,250
You lack common sense as an adventurer.

40
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,417
I don't want to be said so by a monster.

41
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:26,667
But there's a possibility that he's a human.

42
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,917
Then ask him first.

43
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,792
Mr. Alvin, go ahead.

44
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:34,292
Me? Okay then.

45
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,333
Hello! Are you alive?

46
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,958
Don't you think it's too formal?

47
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,542
Hey! What's wrong with you?

48
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:43,917
Be more frank.

49
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:46,333
Wanna hang out for some tea?

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,125
Sorry, you're not my type.

51
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,125
I wasn't talking to you!

52
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,958
No. Why did you make me say that?

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,167
Such a shameless way of speaking.
Only cockroaches do that.

54
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,125
He's moving. Great! He's alive.

55
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,208
Luckily we didn't bury him.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,542
No, he's dead. We should've buried him.

57
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,250
Could it be this zombie can't stand up?

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,625
Great. Then I can beat him.

59
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,750
No!

60
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,417
Don't you feel anything for him
desperately trying to stand up?

61
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,250
I want to beat him.

62
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,417
The zombie is also trying hard to stay alive.

63
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,875
It's dead.

64
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,792
You were going to bury it.

65
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,750
I'm moved by the way it made efforts.

66
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,750
Don't give up. Don't let your heart be rotten.

67
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,333
Keep it up!

68
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,708
Almost there.

69
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,125
Try it again.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,625
Hey! Show me your determination.

71
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,417
He stood up.

72
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:07,667
The zombie... The zombie stood up.

73
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:13,750
The zombie stood up.
The zombie stood up. The zombie...

74
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,250
The zombie stood up.

75
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,958
I'm moved.

76
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,458
Amazing.

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,458
You...

78
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,792
You've got some guts.

79
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,417
His head is off.

80
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,667
No, that's not it. I didn't mean to.

81
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,750
You killed it.

82
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,333
It's already dead!

83
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,208
Anyway, we buried it.

84
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,417
But it's a zombie.
Maybe it'll come back to life.

85
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,292
Don't worry.

86
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:15,000
Let someone who has a sacred heart
prays for it can purify it.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,917
Then it can't be you.

88
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:21,292
You who's still sorrowful after death,

89
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:24,708
rest in peace. When the night comes,

90
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,375
wake up!

91
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,125
Who are you waking it up?

92
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,250
Don't be so obedient.

93
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,333
Oh no, I accidentally resurrected it.

94
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,208
Haha.

95
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,458
It's not a resurrection.

96
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,625
So it's the holy power.

97
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,292
I feel alive again.

98
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,500
But your head is off.

99
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,542
Thank you for waking me up.

100
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,875
I'm Zobita, a zombie.

101
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,542
What a simple name to understand.

102
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,542
I'm Carla, a real healer.

103
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,417
Real? How ridiculous.

104
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:02,125
This is Mr. Alvin, a joker.

105
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,333
I'm a warrior.

106
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,542
And I'm a popular...

107
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,917
Be quiet.

108
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,542
A healer, a joker, and a mushroom.

109
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,958
What a rare group.

110
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,125
Mr. Alvin, it said we're rare.

111
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,833
That's great, Carla. We've been praised.

112
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,125
You're adventurers, right?

113
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,167
It's a destiny that we met each other.

114
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,042
I would like to ask you a favour.

115
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,875
Okay, sure.

116
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,042
That was fast.

117
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,750
How could you accept a monster's task?

118
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,375
To make him owe me a favour.

119
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,792
You're so straightforward.

120
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,917
It's mainly to improve my popularity.

121
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,000
You wicked fellow.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,750
And you're still bad at winking.

123
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,583
All right. What do you want us to do?

124
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,000
Please...

125
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,625
"REVENGE"
Help me get revenge.

126
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,542
REVISION

127
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,125
"PREPARATION"
Let's prepare as well.

128
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,208
Well said. Shut up.

129
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,958
Helping you get revenge isn't an easy task.

130
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,333
Tell us why.

131
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,333
His grades must have dropped.
Because he didn't do revision.

132
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,083
Stop joking around.

133
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:13,292
There's a cemetery ahead forgotten by all.

134
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:14,875
I was there...

135
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:23,833
I was the leader of a zombie dance group
called "Be Zombicious".

136
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,250
It's about revenge, right?

137
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,250
One day, a...

138
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,042
A dreadful necromancer appeared.

139
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:40,083
It's not me. I'm a healer.

140
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,083
I didn't say anything.

141
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,333
The necromancer had a high level.

142
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,708
My companions, one by one, were...

143
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:55,417
I remember that high-level necromancers
are good at manipulating the souls of the dead.

144
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:01,375
They were charmed by the dancing skills.

145
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,167
So cool.

146
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,875
Isn't that a dancer?

147
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:12,250
I can't accept that someone's dancing skills
are better than mine as a leader.

148
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,250
Please get revenge for me!

149
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,417
You're just holding a grudge.

150
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,917
No matter what the reason,

151
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,875
we can't leave the necromancer alone.

152
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,208
We accept the task of revenge.

153
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,958
There's someone more dangerous
next to me who's left alone.

154
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,708
I think this task is very suitable for us.

155
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,167
How?

156
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,542
Holy power is the weakness of the necromancers.

157
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,250
That means I have the advantage.

158
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,417
You don't have holy elements, do you?

159
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:43,500
Speaking of dancing,
it's your strength, Mr. Alvin.

160
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,750
Aren't you good at dancing in others' hands?

161
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,458
You're talking nonsense!

162
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,167
Let's go.

163
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,500
Let's go to the unknown cemetery first.

164
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,583
Are we really going there?

165
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,958
I'll leave it to you.

166
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,375
Hang on a second.

167
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,375
Wait a second. Stop.

168
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,167
Why are you running away?

169
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,833
The zombies these days run so fast.
It's troublesome.

170
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,458
Carla, what are you doing...

171
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,417
What's on your hand?

172
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,917
It's called "Fire of Redemption".

173
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:42,292
It can burn the souls
of the monsters of necromancy.

174
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,625
It's the holy magic of hell.

175
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:48,292
From what you said, I can't tell
what's redemption or holy.

176
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:52,875
And didn't we come to the cemetery
for the necromancer?

177
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,250
Don't worry.

178
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,083
She'll fall into the trap
if we cause a commotion.

179
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,750
Excuse me. It's a little noisy here.

180
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,000
What happened?

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,708
She fell into the trap.

182
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,208
Are you the necromancer?

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,708
I'm so sorry.

184
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,625
I'm a necromancer.

185
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,083
Maria Desfrem.

186
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,125
Nice to meet you.

187
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,458
It's totally different from what I imagined.

188
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,625
We have something in common.

189
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,417
Only the "Death Flame" part.

190
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,458
No worries.

191
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm Alvin. She's Carla.

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,583
Mr. Alvin and Miss Carla.

193
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,667
Nice names.

194
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,417
Really?

195
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,458
It makes me shy.

196
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,667
I think Alvin is a great name, too.

197
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,042
It fits you very well.

198
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,833
Oh, well. It makes me feel bad.

199
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,083
Why are you two here?

200
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,542
It's a forgotten cemetery.

201
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:55,333
I don't think you're here to visit the grave...

202
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,500
We're here to visit the grave.

203
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,750
Your grave.

204
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,792
Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

205
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,375
What are you talking about?

206
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,000
Why are you trying to start a fight?

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,958
Didn't we accept Zobita's task of revenge?

208
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,375
He's just holding a grudge.

209
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,500
And now we're persuading him
to think about it again.

210
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,833
Is the warrior that weak?

211
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,125
You're much stronger compared to Alvin.

212
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,792
I advise you not to take revenge.

213
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,583
You're right.

214
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,750
But the necromancers can manipulate the dead.
It's profanity to the dead.

215
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,250
We can't leave her alone.

216
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,583
You profane both the living and the dead.
You're not qualified to say that.

217
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,083
She does look pretty.

218
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,292
But she must be like a devil inside.

219
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,583
What? Are you introducing yourself?

220
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,625
Look!

221
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,083
You're being so loud.

222
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,417
She manipulated so many zombies.

223
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,458
Hello, Lord Maria.

224
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,792
Hello.

225
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,167
It's Lord Maria.

226
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,625
Please show me your graceful dance again.

227
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,292
It seems she's adored by the zombies.

228
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,042
She must have threatened the zombies.

229
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,167
Is it necessary to do such a troublesome thing?

230
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,667
I'd do that.

231
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,958
Shameless.

232
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,667
Are you talking about Lord Maria
behind her back?

233
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,958
No...

234
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,000
What?

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,333
She was chasing us just now.

236
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,250
Take a closer look. She's a healer.
The enemy of the undead.

237
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,750
You must be here to frame Lord Maria.

238
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,375
Hold on. We can explain this.

239
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,667
That's right.

240
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:30,875
With our fists.

241
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,792
Can you please shut up?

242
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,583
MARIA

243
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,208
You've shown your true colours.

244
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,750
You wicked healer.

245
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,375
Never lay a finger on Lord Maria.

246
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,833
Don't fight.

247
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,625
What's more, Miss Carla is a cleric.

248
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,708
You all can't beat her.

249
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:53,000
Even if she's stronger than us,
we also have to protect Lord Maria.

250
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,458
Lord Maria, run now.

251
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,042
Come on and fight.

252
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,583
We become the villains.

253
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,583
They're like knights
protecting the princess instead.

254
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,250
I won't run away this time.

255
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,917
We won't lose.

256
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:10,667
Fight for someone you cherish.

257
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,292
It's cool, right?

258
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,167
Yes.

259
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,750
Mr. Alvin, there's someone you need to protect.

260
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,708
Oh, no need.

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,208
You're Carla's...

262
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,875
Shut up.

263
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,500
There's no choice but to do it.

264
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,958
Well, I'm the frontline.

265
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,250
I won't let you harm Carla.

266
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,917
Is that okay?

267
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,625
Mr. Alvin.

268
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,083
But I don't think you can win.

269
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,167
Are you trying to be funny?

270
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,042
All right.

271
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,667
Are you ready to die?

272
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,250
Come on.

273
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,667
Traitor! Bastard!

274
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,875
Shut up, you idiot!

275
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,958
Geez, let me go.

276
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,667
Honestly. It doesn't work.

277
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,083
Let's just stay quiet.

278
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:36,667
This happened because you betrayed me.

279
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,583
I mean...

280
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,333
Why am I the only one caught?

281
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,250
Because I caught you.

282
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,833
-The criminal caught should be imprisoned.
-No, I don't want it.

283
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,458
I surrender. It hurts.

284
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,750
I got the traitor. Put him in prison.

285
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,750
Finally, we avoided the fight.
No casualties, and it was solved safely.

286
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,875
But my pride has been hurt badly.

287
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,875
Oh, just throw it away.

288
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:10,208
Anyway, I'm going to discuss your situation
with the zombies now.

289
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,083
They'll let you go when they find out
that you're useless.

290
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,583
Watch your words.

291
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,292
Maria.

292
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,292
Sorry for getting you involved.

293
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,917
No, Maria. You don't have to apologize.

294
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,542
That's right. Just be careful next time.

295
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:32,167
-Right?
-You should be careful all the time.

296
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,792
I'm sorry, but...

297
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,708
They just discussed and decided

298
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:43,542
to turn the warrior into a zombie.

299
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,917
Hold on. Do you mean they're going to kill me?

300
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,750
But he's already socially dead
from being imprisoned.

301
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,042
I'm not dead, and you put me in here!

302
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:59,333
They want to add more zombie buddies for me.

303
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,083
But I think we can't ignore your thought
and turn you into a zombie.

304
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,667
So I brought the key. Please run away.

305
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,375
Is that okay?

306
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:14,417
Keep it a secret from the zombies.

307
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,125
What an angel.

308
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,125
Did you call me?

309
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,833
I didn't call you!

310
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,458
Please wait a moment.

311
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,375
I'm Mr. Alvin's companion.
It's my duty to rescue him.

312
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,875
Didn't you put me in jail?

313
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,208
And you don't have the key.

314
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,083
There's unlocking magic.

315
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,667
With the explosive unlocking magic.

316
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,792
Are you a saboteur?

317
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,292
It's a good chance.

318
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:42,292
Let's see who can rescue Mr. Alvin first.

319
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,417
The necromancer of darkness

320
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,792
can't beat... the healer of light.

321
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,333
Light and darkness.
It should be the other way round.

322
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,250
Maria can just open it with the key.

323
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,417
But I don't know which one it is.

324
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,708
-There's a lot.
-What should I do?

325
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,292
It's okay. Try them one by one.

326
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:07,625
That's right. Take your time.

327
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,042
Appreciate your last conversation
with Mr. Alvin.

328
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:13,750
Aren't you competing to save me first?

329
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,792
I'll start chanting.

330
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,417
Not this one.

331
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:25,333
It's all right. Try the next one.

332
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,042
Ten.

333
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,208
Nine.

334
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:35,667
-Maria, you just tried that one.
-Eight.

335
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:38,167
-Huh, how strange.
-Seven.

336
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,917
-I'm confused.
-Four.

337
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,250
Why do you skip the middle?

338
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,917
Don't count down!

339
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,833
Three.

340
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,667
-I'm so stressed.
-Two.

341
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,667
-One.
-Are you all right?

342
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:57,875
I'm sorry...

343
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,125
I can't watch this anymore.

344
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,708
Miss Carla, what about your chant?

345
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,583
Forget about it.

346
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:12,000
Pick the keys that don't fit first.

347
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay.

348
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,792
Is it a key?

349
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:19,250
We'll usually mark them

350
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,208
or distinguish them by their uses.

351
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,250
You're right. I'll do that next time.

352
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,083
I've been watching you for a long time.

353
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,250
Miss Maria, you're a clumsy person, aren't you?

354
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,667
What are you laughing at?

355
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,750
No, sorry.

356
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,958
I think Miss Carla is much more gentle
than I thought.

357
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,583
Thank you...

358
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,500
Wait a second. Carla is gentle?

359
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,458
Impossible. You crack me up.

360
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,750
She's not gentle. She's strange.

361
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,125
What kind of weird atmosphere is this?
