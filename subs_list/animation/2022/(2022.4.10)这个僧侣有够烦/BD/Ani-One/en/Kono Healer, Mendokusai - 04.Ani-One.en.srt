1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,833
There are many monsters threatening humans

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,708
in the vast world where we live.

3
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:15,250
Many adventurers and heroes

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,833
stepped forward bravely.

5
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,833
They face many dangerous challenges today

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,083
to protect the people and the world.

7
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:31,500
And I, Alvin, is one of them.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,208
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

9
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,917
let's continue the adventure today.

10
00:00:51,458 --> 00:01:00,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

11
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,042
THE TITLE
ALVIN AND Carla CHALLENGED A DUNGEON FOR THE FIRST TIME.

12
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,542
THE DUNGEON IS DESIGNED FOR BEGINNERS.
EVEN ALVIN SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH.

13
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:14,917
BUT HE WAS CALLED A VETERAN ROOKIE
WASN'T FOR NO REASON.

14
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:17,375
"THE TRAP CAVE HERE"
Mr. Alvin, where are we going today?

15
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,750
"APPEARED ENDLESSLY LIKE STUNTS (?)."
A dungeon.

16
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,042
"THE NAME OF THIS MUSHROOM MONSTER IS Altargaia."
Are you kidding me?

17
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,792
"THERE MAY BE NO CHANCE TO CALL IT,BUT REMEMBER THE NAME."
I'm serious.

18
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:24,042
"APART FROM PAUSING ANIMATION, PLEASE ALSO GO TO"
You think it's too hard for me, don't you?

19
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,167
"THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE TO CONFIRM. THAT'S EPISODE FOUR."
No, but everyone probably thinks so.

20
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:32,083
Don't worry. The dungeon we're going to
is suitable for beginners.

21
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,375
So it's a dungeon for you, Mr. Alvin.

22
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,458
Am I the master of the dungeon?

23
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,708
I got it.

24
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,083
It's your house, right?

25
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,417
I said, we're going to "a dungeon."

26
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,625
I found it. There's a building ahead.

27
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,417
It should be there.

28
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,958
This is my first dungeon adventure.

29
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,917
It's getting a little nervous.

30
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,125
All right. Let's go!

31
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:07,042
WELCOME TO DUNGEON FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS

32
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:09,083
DON'T WORRY
IT'S SAFE

33
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,333
Your house is so unique.

34
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,083
Is it a designer's house?

35
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,958
It's not my house.

36
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,625
If it were my house, I'd find the designer
and his descendants even after I died.

37
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,125
What should we do now?

38
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,667
The dungeon is very different
from what I thought.

39
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,125
But let's go in first...

40
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
Hold up.

41
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,375
Are you a monster?

42
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,458
Warrior, put your sword down.

43
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,500
I have no intention to fight with you.

44
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,708
What?

45
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,083
Even if you don't have it, we do.

46
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,333
Let's fight.

47
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,000
Clergy shouldn't look for fights.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,917
Do you want to enter the dungeon?

49
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:52,333
If we do, so what? Do you want to stop us?

50
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,458
I just said I have no intention
to fight with you.

51
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,083
-Look. It just said that.
-But it's a dungeon for absolute beginners.

52
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,958
-You're the one who wants to fight most.
-Is it really suitable for you to enter?

53
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,500
Hey, listen to me!

54
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,917
-Huh?
-What's that?

55
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,750
So you weren't listening to me.

56
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,917
I hardly act so seriously…

57
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,875
Do you mean

58
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,500
only beginners can enter this dungeon?

59
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,083
Someone was listening to me. That's great.

60
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:23,083
About that,
Mr. Alvin has a one-year beginner pass.

61
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,208
I don't, okay?

62
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,458
It's okay. I just have to look into you.

63
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,708
Here I go.

64
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,708
This…

65
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,667
One, one, one hundred!

66
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,667
Beginner Level 100!

67
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,583
What a pity.

68
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,667
I knew this would happen.

69
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,292
Useless Level 100.

70
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,042
I understand.

71
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,167
I can't tell what you understand.

72
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:04,708
It also means to stay true to yourself…

73
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,500
PUFF

74
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,667
Your comfort makes me feel even worse.

75
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,958
All right. Please come in.

76
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,167
What's with that music?

77
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,542
First dungeon adventure.

78
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,458
We're going to challenge it, right?

79
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,750
Yes.

80
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,333
Be careful on the way.

81
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,208
Okay. Thank you.

82
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm tired.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,458
It's tiring just by entering.

84
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,083
But this is a dungeon. I can't be like this.

85
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,125
Pull myself together.

86
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,917
There may be traps inside.

87
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,250
Listen, you two.

88
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,375
It's for beginners, but it's still a dungeon.

89
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,292
Be careful of your surroundings…

90
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,625
There it is.

91
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,750
Mr. Alvin's useless Level 100 skill.

92
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,667
Mr. Alvin, are you all right?

93
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,125
There's a blanket at the bottom.

94
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,250
A ladder on the wall.

95
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,875
It's a trap of a beginner dungeon indeed.

96
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,833
Hurry up and come up.

97
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,958
You're not injured, after all.

98
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,917
He feels so down.

99
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:41,000
Really. I'll go and encourage him.

100
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,625
Mr. Alvin.

101
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,958
Awesome. Hole-in-one.

102
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,958
You're indeed a professional teacher
of bad example.

103
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,292
Have your brain cells for encouraging others
all gone?

104
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,083
I don't like falling into a trap, either…

105
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,542
Okay… I know.

106
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,667
Actually, I've prepared a magic prop
against traps.

107
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:02,875
Here you go.

108
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,458
Really?

109
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:08,792
Come on. You should've given it to me earlier…

110
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,167
What is it? A normal cloth?

111
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,542
Well, a beginner doesn't know that.

112
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:20,083
Listen. If you're trapped again,

113
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,042
Trapped…

114
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,792
You would feel ashamed and upset.

115
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,625
So please use it to wipe your tears.

116
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,708
It's just a normal handkerchief!

117
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,208
I'm not going to cry.

118
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,250
How rude.

119
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,875
It's frequently used when cleaning.

120
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,250
So it's a rag.

121
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,458
I won't get trapped again.

122
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,500
Let's go.

123
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,667
Concentrate. Pay attention to the surroundings.

124
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,125
Detect danger and avoid it as soon as possible.

125
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,750
Concentrate. Pay attention to the surroundings…

126
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,042
It's getting darker.

127
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:54,250
It's dark here. Watch your step.

128
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,917
I know.

129
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,625
Mr. Alvin.

130
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,708
Pull that lever.
Maybe it can turn on the lights.

131
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,250
That lever?

132
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,458
I see. That makes sense.

133
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,167
It's so dark and hard to see the traps.

134
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,792
It's a beginner dungeon indeed.

135
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,833
I'm not crying.

136
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,958
Don't act tough. Come on.

137
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,542
Don't give me the rag.

138
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,083
Stop fooling around. Let's go.

139
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,500
I'm not fooling around!

140
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,125
Concentrate. Pay attention to the surroundings.
Detect danger and avoid it as soon as possible.

141
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,250
Hey, Alvin.

142
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,542
I didn't expect you'd fall into
such a boring trap.

143
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,958
To be honest, don't you think
you're not fit to be an adventurer?

144
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,917
NOT FIT

145
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,375
It's a misunderstanding.

146
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,625
Misunderstanding?

147
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,958
Mr. Alvin sacrificed himself

148
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,708
so that we wouldn't fall into the trap.

149
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,833
Really?

150
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,375
Of course.

151
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,958
People normally won't fall into
such a simple trap.

152
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,167
Right, Mr. Alvin?

153
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,500
You found it out.

154
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,125
So it's true.

155
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,208
It's a warrior's duty to keep companions safe.

156
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,250
You're amazing, Mr. Alvin.

157
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,833
Don't mention it.

158
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,542
You should've just told us.

159
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:34,083
Right? Why did you put yourself in danger?

160
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,875
Don't compliment me, then mock me again!

161
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,667
Do you like getting trapped recently?

162
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,875
Don't say like as if getting trapped is a hobby.

163
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,500
Alvin, watch your step.

164
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,167
Oh no, we're locked up.

165
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:57,083
The wall…

166
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,958
Oh, crap. We'll be crushed if it goes on.

167
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,750
What should we do…

168
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,417
It stops as soon as I push it gently.

169
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,000
Mr. Alvin.

170
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,042
When did you get out?

171
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,042
Did you use magic?

172
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:28,583
No. There's a door within the iron fence.

173
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,708
Look.

174
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:35,083
The more flustered you're,
the less you can see what's in front of you.

175
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,458
Concentrate. Pay attention to the surroundings.

176
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,125
That's great, Mr. Alvin.

177
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,750
You fell into every trap since the beginning.

178
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,875
That must be what the traps expected.

179
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,375
Why do you personify traps?

180
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,917
Traps exist to make people fall into them.

181
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:01,042
In this way, Mr. Alvin is an ideal adventurer.

182
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,667
I don't want to be such an ideal adventurer.

183
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,208
Look over there.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,333
That's…

185
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,000
A door.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,792
There's no other path.

187
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,250
It goes straight to the end.

188
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,292
"PLEASE PRESS IF YOU NEED IT"
There seems to be something like a button.

189
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,708
It's probably a trap again.

190
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,958
It's too obvious that it's suspicious.

191
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,167
It's most likely a trap.

192
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,000
That's right.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,750
What should we do…

194
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:47,292
I'll leave it to you, Pro Alvin.

195
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:48,667
Who are you calling a pro?

196
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,125
As you always do.

197
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,250
What do I always do?

198
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll press it as you wish.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,042
ANTICIPATING

200
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:07,125
"PLEASE PRESS IF YOU NEED IT"
Concentrate. Pay attention to the surroundings.

201
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,208
Detect danger and avoid it as soon as possible.

202
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,083
All right. I'm going to press it.

203
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,500
That must be a trap. It's dangerous.

205
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,833
But there's no other way.

206
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,667
Well, right…

207
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm going to press it.

208
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,042
I'm doing it. I'm going to press it.

209
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:28,500
No matter what happens, don't panic.

210
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,375
Where will the trick come from?

211
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,167
Up? Down? Right? Left?

212
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,208
Will it come from the back… Both of you!

213
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,125
The door may not open even if I press it.

214
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,375
I'm still afraid that it's a trap.

215
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,083
We should be cautious...

216
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,250
Oh, right.
It may be safer to press it with a sword.

217
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,583
So I won't be the target of the trap.

218
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,417
Okay. I'm going to press it.

219
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,542
It opened.

220
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,083
You broke it open!

221
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,250
That's a terrible wink.

222
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,125
The result is the same.

223
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,000
Except that you destroyed things.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,125
What was that noise?

225
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:19,750
It sounds like breaking the door
with "Tetsuzanko."

226
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,917
What happened?

227
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,167
DOMESTIC-MADE

228
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,167
The door was broken…

229
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,583
What's coming?

230
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,417
Suspicious person.

231
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,917
For the current situation, that's us…

232
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,750
Could it be that you're the adventurers?

233
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,125
Sort of…

234
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,792
I knew it.

235
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:40,042
All right, don't stand here. Come on in.

236
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,042
It seems to welcome us.

237
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,708
Is it a trap as well?

238
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,542
Go in and have a look first.

239
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:51,333
Even if it's a trap, it's designed
for beginners. Who would be trapped?

240
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,625
Come on in. Help yourselves.

241
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,917
Say it if you dare.

242
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,167
No, it's nothing.

243
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,375
Come on. This way.

244
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,333
Please have a seat.

245
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,042
Have some tea.

246
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,875
Okay. Thank you.

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,083
Could it be poisonous?

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,292
You're drinking it?

249
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,750
It's warm. And it tastes awful.

250
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,375
You're being too honest.

251
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:37,083
Sorry, I'll get you a new one.

252
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,583
"BULL SERVING DRESSING WEIGHT"
The serving level is way too high!

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,375
By the way, who are you…

254
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,125
I'm the master of this dungeon.

255
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:52,708
You finally came here, foolish adventurers.

256
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,333
Now only you're so aggressive…

257
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,083
I advise you to get changed.

258
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,500
DOMESTIC-MADE

259
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,458
Even a beginner won't fall into
those simple traps.

260
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,208
Huh? Did you fall into those traps?

261
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm so happy.

262
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,333
I didn't expect an adventurer
would fall into them.

263
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,875
Even if you're a beginner, it's too…

264
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,917
What's so funny about that?

265
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,458
One of us sacrificed.

266
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,875
Don't say it as if someone died, okay?

267
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,000
How… How could it be…

268
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:40,625
The safety myth of the dungeon
was finally ruined.

269
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,333
I'm alive.

270
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,375
What… have I done?

271
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:50,000
You finally found out your sins.

272
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,833
I didn't mean to kill someone.

273
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,417
Since you're a monster,
you should be aware of killing someone.

274
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,000
Everyone makes mistakes.

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,333
The most important thing
is to make up for your sins.

276
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,458
How to make up?

277
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,708
Stop wavering, cleric.

278
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,708
I got it.

279
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,458
Please wait a minute.

280
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,083
Yet, all I have left…

281
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,708
After all, I worked very hard.

282
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,583
Just give it to me then.

283
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,917
A coin jewelry?

284
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,875
Is it a magic item?

285
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:32,542
No. It's a souvenir for adventurers
who come to the dungeon.

286
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,667
It looks like just jewelry.

287
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,667
Perhaps…

288
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,667
What is it?

289
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,792
It's just trash.

290
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,667
Mind your words!

291
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,375
Everybody, have you got drinks?

292
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:58,917
Then let's celebrate Carla and her party
challenging the dungeon.

293
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,125
Cheers.

294
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,417
Thank you for your hard work.

295
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,583
Wait a second. It's too weird.

296
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,458
Why are we celebrating happily with the monster?

297
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,708
And I didn't get the drink yet.

298
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,583
Let me take this opportunity to talk about it.

299
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,375
How much longer are you going to follow us?

300
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,958
Since you're the dungeon master,
show your majesty!

301
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,250
Let me share the salad.

302
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,708
It's not time to share the salad!

303
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,125
Let's be frank today.

304
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,417
Mr. Alvin, can you give me a massage?

305
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,958
Are you a tyrant?

306
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,708
Mr. Alvin.

307
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,667
What's wrong?

308
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,875
You're too excited. It's embarrassing.

309
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,500
I'm getting angry.

310
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,625
And you're the excited one.

311
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,083
What's that costume? Birthday party?

312
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,708
Your costume is weirder.

313
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,667
Warrior costume party?

314
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,583
I'm dressed as usual.

315
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,375
But I understand your excitement.

316
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,500
As an adventurer, it's my first time
challenging the dungeon.

317
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,875
Is it your first time too?

318
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

319
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,167
It's not warm.

320
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,958
That makes sense.

321
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,208
For her personality,

322
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,208
she'll be kicked out wherever she goes.

323
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,667
That's why her behavior is so boastful.

324
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,208
I've been refused to join many teams

325
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,125
due to my lack of strength.

326
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,958
Excuse me. Do you want to…

327
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,958
Sorry, but your level…

328
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,708
He's a veteran rookie.

329
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,500
In other words,

330
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,083
today is the day you two managed
to challenge the dungeon for the first time.

331
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,750
It's a day of commemoration.

332
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,375
Did we manage to challenge it?
I'm not sure about that.

333
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,417
Day of commemoration...

334
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:50,833
It's... our party's... day of commemoration.

335
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,417
Why? Are you happy?

336
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,833
No. It's normal.

337
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,625
Am I right? Are you shy?

338
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,333
What's wrong with you?
Do you want to see how the hell is?

339
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,500
What a dangerous way of being shy.

340
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,792
Since we managed to challenge it.

341
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,083
Come on.

342
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,208
What is it?

343
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,250
Don't you know that? High five.

344
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,875
Companions always do so
when achieving goals together.

345
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,500
Companions always do so…

346
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,250
You liar.

347
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,875
Mr. Alvin, you have no experience
in forming a team with others.

348
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,083
Yet, you said "companions always do so."
It's too contradictory.

349
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,042
It's so weird.

350
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:34,542
It's not.

351
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,750
You real intention is…

352
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,833
Use high five as an excuse to touch my body.

353
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,500
All right.
It doesn't matter if you don't want to do it.

354
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,417
MOST OUTSTANDING AWARD

355
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,458
We're companions, anyway.

356
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,458
A little body touch is okay.

357
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,500
She's so annoying.

358
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,042
Okay, I got it. Come on.

359
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:03,083
There… There's no choice.

360
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,625
Let's celebrate us challenging the dungeon
successfully for the first time.

361
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:11,000
Honestly. She's obviously happy.

362
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,875
Thank you for your hard work.

363
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,292
Thank you for challenging the dungeon.

364
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,458
You did a great job.

365
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,750
The food was very delicious.
Thank you very much.

366
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,458
I had a great time.

367
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,333
"WELCOME TO DUNGEON FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS"
Good luck with your adventure.

368
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,417
What an interesting party.

369
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,125
All right. I have to fix the door inside.

370
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,125
Until when you're going to wear that hat?

371
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,250
Mr. Bull gave me that as a souvenir.

372
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,458
It's rude to take it off
as Mr. Bull still can see us.

373
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,000
Will it?

374
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,958
Yes.

375
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,375
Oh right, Alvin.

376
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,458
What's the matter?

377
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,750
The button in the dungeon isn't a trap.

378
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,708
It's a normal doorbell.

379
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,542
I see. It's really a beginner dungeon.

380
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,417
It's getting late.

381
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:09,083
Hopefully, we can find a hotel before sunset.

382
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,917
Right, Carla?

383
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,417
What... What are you talking about?

384
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:17,542
-Well, find a hotel…
-Find a hotel, right? Hurry up then.

385
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,333
Well, Miss Carla. You're a little strange.

386
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,583
Strange…
I don't want to be said so by someone strange.

387
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,458
Do you mean I'm interestingly strange?

388
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
Or pervertedly strange?

389
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,000
Perverted.

390
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,792
What?

391
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,083
Mr. Mushroom is gone.

392
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,875
Oh, he'll catch up soon anyway.

393
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,292
You're right.

394
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,542
We can pay less for the accommodation fee.

395
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,542
What a terrible cleric.

396
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:47,083
I'm worried about your wallet, Mr. Alvin.

397
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,458
Who are you calling poor?

398
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:55,000
WHERE AM I

399
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,250
"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW"
Title of the next episode.

400
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,375
"THIS WORLD IS FULL OF DEMONS AND MONSTERS"
When Elvin and Kara

401
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:29,500
"COVERED IN HUMAN SKIN."
planned to stay in the hotel,

402
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,625
"AND THE NAME OF THE HOTEL IS 'PIG GIRL'S PLACE.'"
the owner who seemed nice

403
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,979
"SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM."
revealed her true colors

404
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,333
"IT'S A FAMOUS WORK ANYWAY."
because of Carla.

405
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,208
"THOSE WHO KNOW WILL FEEL SO NOSTALGIC."
Then the nature of an old woman

406
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,250
"I HAVEN'T SEEN IT FOR A LONG TIME. I WANT TO SEE IT."
met on the way was very unexpected.

407
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,333
"AND I'M IMMERSED IN THESE FEELINGS. THAT'S EPISODE FIVE."
In this world,

408
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,125
"STAY TUNED"
not all, but…
