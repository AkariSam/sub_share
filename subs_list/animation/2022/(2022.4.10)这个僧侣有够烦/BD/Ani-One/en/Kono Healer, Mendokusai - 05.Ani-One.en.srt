1
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:05,625
There are many monsters threatening humans.

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:09,583
Many brave adventurers stepped forward bravely.

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,542
And I,

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,458
Alvin, is one of them.

5
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,792
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

6
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,833
let's continue the adventure today.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:43,167
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

8
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,542
THE TITLE
PIG GIRL'S PLACE

9
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,458
WHEN ALVIN AND CARLA PLANNED TO STAY
IN THE HOTEL, THE OWNER WHO SEEMED NICE

10
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,500
REVEALED HER TRUE COLORS BECAUSE OF CARLA.
THEN THE NATURE OF AN OLD WOMAN

11
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,708
"MET ON THE WAY WAS VERY UNEXPECTED."
Excuse me.

12
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,542
"THIS WORLD IS FULL OF DEMONS AND MONSTERS"
We want to stay for one night.

13
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,708
"COVERED IN HUMAN SKIN."
Puff, welcome to Pig Girl's Place.

14
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,625
"AND THE NAME OF THE HOTEL IS PIG GIRL'S PLACE. SOME PEOPLE
MAY NOT KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM." What a great hotel name.

15
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,167
"IT'S A FAMOUS WORK ANYWAY. THOSE WHO KNOW
WILL FEEL SO NOSTALGIC." Puff, thank you very much.

16
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,917
"I HAVEN'T SEEN IT FOR A LONG TIME. I WANT TO SEE IT."
How many guests?

17
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,625
"AND I'M IMMERSED IN THESE FEELINGS. THAT'S EPISODE FIVE."
Me and someone like a goblin. Two people.

18
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,292
-I don't want to stay in a pigsty...
-It's a hotel.

19
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:17,708
But anyway...

20
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,250
It's totally a human.

21
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,833
But he keeps puffing.

22
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,042
Stop it.

23
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,500
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,583
Nothing. Please don't mind.

25
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,208
It's just goblin's nonsense.

26
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:32,542
If you don't mind,
I'll prepare dinner for you two.

27
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,792
My interest is cooking.

28
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:39,417
-Is this a butcher shop?
-It's a hotel.

29
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,833
What's the menu for dinner?

30
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,500
Deep-fried pork cutlet.

31
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,375
-Is it... pork cutlet?
-Puff.

32
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:52,167
Deep-fried pork cutlet by killing the same kind.
It must be delicious.

33
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,500
What an incredible guy.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,875
Hey, you.

35
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,917
Say it to the person concerned.

36
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,042
It's so rude.

37
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:03,125
What? You also think so, don't you?

38
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,125
You're a pathetic creature
covered in the skin of a kind human.

39
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,458
And I'm just an honest person
who speaks your mind.

40
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,208
This is called hypocrisy.

41
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,333
And why are you shaking?

42
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,125
It's getting dizzy...

43
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,417
Just spit out your evil heart.

44
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,792
You really didn't find out.

45
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:24,292
That ugly... Personalized protective layer.
Was your observation cursed?

46
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,667
What do you mean?

47
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:30,250
I mean, that pig isn't a human.

48
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,833
Pigs aren't humans.

49
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,500
I mean...

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,792
I'm trapped in the darkness of the eternal land.

51
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,375
How dare you say I'm a pig...

52
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,750
Look, it's getting angry.
The manager is very angry.

53
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,083
Is the manager an Iberian pig?

54
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,792
Are you too hungry?

55
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,500
How dare you look down on me.

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,333
The manager's look...

57
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,792
Is he going to reveal his true colors?

58
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:58,000
All right. Am I a pig or not?

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,083
I'll let you feel it.

60
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,500
A monster.

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,583
Please be careful. This guy is a very unlucky
monster to the dark elf.

62
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,875
You're a goblin. It has nothing to do with you.

63
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,542
Puff.

64
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,708
How dare you say that about me.

65
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,083
Are you pretending as a human?

66
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,375
Is it a civet?

67
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,458
Oh, that's enough. I've had enough.

68
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,667
How dare you think of me like a pig.

69
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:27,125
I'm a super noble orc, puff.

70
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,875
It looks so strong.

71
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,583
Please wait a minute.
I found something surprising.

72
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,292
I found it out. I'm an angel indeed.

73
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,833
Oh, that's amazing.

74
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,917
But things can get troublesome.
Just murmur in your heart.

75
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,667
I suspected the manager was a pig...

76
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,292
The type that can't hide something.

77
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,333
But he just mooed.

78
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,750
He's not a pig but a cow.

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,167
I was tricked. I thought he must be a pig.

80
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,083
I just said I'm an orc. Puff, puff!

81
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,458
It's his stand.

82
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,375
But he just said "moo".

83
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,000
I said "Oh", not moo.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,792
So you're really a pig.

85
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:07,375
I said I'm not a pig. I'm an orc.

86
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,875
A pig orc.

87
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,750
Oh, it's an orc. Orc!

88
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
You mooed again. You're really a cow.

89
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,792
I just said it wasn't a sound.

90
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,917
I'm enough of this. Cry.

91
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,250
Monkey. That's a lot.

92
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,958
Aren't you too greedy?

93
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:27,208
Shut up!
Don't think you can get away after fooling me.

94
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,208
Then how much for staying one night?

95
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,417
Accommodation for both... No way!

96
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,417
Let's fight one-on-one.

97
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,875
Hold on.
She can be said to be the origin of all evil.

98
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,542
But one-on-one seems...

99
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,833
Okay.

100
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,292
Don't regret it.

101
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:45,667
If you win, you can call me a pig or a cow.

102
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,167
I got it.

103
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:51,125
If I lose, I'll think of you like a pig.

104
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,250
It's fair, right?

105
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
Are you a tyrant?

106
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,042
What did you say?

107
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:58,625
So whether I win or not,
I'll be considered a pig.

108
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,583
-Let's do it.
-Hold on. I haven't finished my words yet.

109
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,250
-Rock, Scissors...
-Why is it a guessing game?

110
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,375
Puff.

111
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,917
I think she deliberately said "puff"
instead of "paper".

112
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:17,125
I know, but I've been tricked like a fool.
I don't know how to respond instead.

113
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,708
Don't mind it. Just get to the point.

114
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,833
Scold as much as...

115
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,917
What's wrong?

116
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,250
I suddenly feel so hot.

117
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,750
It seems I was attacked by blood burning.

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,208
You just fell, didn't you?

119
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,667
Is this... the feeling of being humiliated...

120
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,833
Self-destructive fool.

121
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:38,125
If I don't give you a lesson,
you won't know the pain.

122
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,583
Well said.

123
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,292
But from my stand, it's my duty to protect her.

124
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,125
I won't let you attack her again.

125
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,000
I've always wanted to say so.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then you'll be beaten up together.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,292
Jump…

128
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,167
Hecaton suppression...

129
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,625
How short the distance is.

130
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,125
What's wrong?

131
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,042
The landing foot is broken.

132
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,375
Lose weight.

133
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,875
Help him with healing magic.

134
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
I can't look at it anymore.

135
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,250
Sorry, I don't know how to cure
a pig that can't fly.

136
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,958
But I can give him the last blow.

137
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,667
Are you sure?
Maybe it can increase your favorability.

138
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,833
Don't move.

139
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll cast healing magic on you now.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,875
Forget it. No matter what you do,
your favorability won't increase much.

141
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:29,000
You want to save me. Why?

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is there any reason to save
those suffering in front of you?

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,875
Then don't ask him for a treatment fee later.

144
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,417
Try to deny it.

145
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,500
Puff, Lord Saint.

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,333
It seems that his brain is injured, too.

147
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,542
Come on. People always call me so.

148
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,250
She's injured more badly.

149
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,250
Before that, manager.

150
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,458
I want to ask a question.

151
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,917
It's about the travelers and adventurers
who have stayed in this hotel.

152
00:07:56,917 --> 00:08:03,250
The reason why the monster orc
purposely became a human to run this hotel.

153
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,792
What is it...

154
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,292
Puff, bad things will be found out
sooner or later.

155
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,292
Are you a pig farmer?

156
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:13,375
Since Lord Saint is here, I can confess to you.

157
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:19,417
As you expected, many travelers, adventurers
and foreign businessmen came to this hotel.

158
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,875
Only come to the orc's hotel.

159
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,667
They were tired from long trips and adventures.

160
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:28,042
When they arrived at the hotel,
they were usually unprepared and careless.

161
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,125
Could it be...

162
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:33,958
Right. When they were careless,
I poured it into the dishes...

163
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,875
Poison.

164
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,792
Medicine with nourishing effect.

165
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,417
Nourishing... It doesn't seem quite right.

166
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:47,792
But if the amount isn't right,
you'll be more tired after eating it.

167
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:53,417
I only hope the guests who came to stay
can recover a little bit.

168
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:59,292
But it'll backfire if I don't do it right.

169
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,958
It's the problem of usage and amount, right?

170
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,208
I'm a stupid teammate who put my guests
in danger.

171
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,833
Wait a second.

172
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:10,042
Carla, he doesn't seem to be a bad guy.

173
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:13,667
It doesn't seem right for us
to get angry at him.

174
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,000
I see.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,125
Then we can't blame him.

176
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,333
-Guilty.
-You sentenced him immediately.

177
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:25,042
Puff, please forgive me.

178
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:33,958
Mr. Alvin.

179
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,625
Are you going to sell me to a human trafficker?

180
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,917
It'll bring trouble to the human trafficker.

181
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,333
I'm going to solve the guild's
"collecting herbs" task.

182
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,208
I see. By the way, Mr. Alvin.

183
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,458
Can you stop shaking so much? I'll get carsick.

184
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,167
Get off then.

185
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,125
Why do you just sit...

186
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,750
Mr. Alvin, there's someone ahead.

187
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,083
A traveler. No, it's an old woman.

188
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,125
Is she not feeling well?

189
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,208
Let's go and ask her.

190
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,708
Do you want her to pull this cart?

191
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,833
Why would you think so?

192
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,792
So you want to chat her up.

193
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,333
Stop talking about it.

194
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,125
Excuse me.

195
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,375
Old lady, are you all right? Are you not...

196
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,958
Miss, you look idle.

197
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,708
Do you want to have fun with us?

198
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,042
Don't chat her up.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,375
Young people are so energetic.

200
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,542
I just sit here and take a rest.

201
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,542
There will be monsters here.

202
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,625
Let us take you home.

203
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,667
Is that okay?

204
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:39,125
You approach people in trouble
with gentle words.

205
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,958
Saying sweet words to take a woman home.

206
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,917
You seem natural and skilled.

207
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:45,917
Your words...

208
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,917
But you're not popular. It's unbelievable.

209
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,750
It's none of your business.

210
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,208
Should I just go with you?

211
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,542
The dull guy didn't find out I'm a witch.

212
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:03,250
And I need male internal organs to make drugs.

213
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,792
You get off and walk.

214
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,875
It's a hint to piggyback me.

215
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,250
And there's a dark elf.

216
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,083
What an excellent "material" that's hard to get.

217
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,708
I can't miss it.

218
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,875
Young man, take this.

219
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,000
What's it?

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,750
It's my self-made medicine
for restoring physical strength.

221
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,292
I wanted to drink it later.
But I'll give it to you.

222
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,625
It's a great help to me.

223
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,375
Dull guy, that's highly toxic.

224
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:36,917
Let the man be weak first. And the woman...

225
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,375
What's wrong?

226
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,917
It's hard to pull out the cork.

227
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,250
Why would you dress like this?

228
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,542
Give it to me. I'll open it for you.

229
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,875
-I'm sorry.
-It's no big deal.

230
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,750
Mr. Alvin, you can't live without me.

231
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,458
I can live without you.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,042
I'm sick of it.

233
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,208
What are you doing?

234
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:12,500
Mr. Alvin, come on. Lick it like a dog.

235
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,792
Are you kidding me?

236
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:14,875
Three-second rule.

237
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,000
The liquid doesn't apply to this rule.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,708
Why would you throw it when you can't open it?

239
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:25,083
No, it... Well...

240
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,000
Right, that's poison.

241
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,583
What poison?

242
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,542
You just wanted me to lick...

243
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,542
-Idiot.
-Shut up, bastard.

244
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,500
Mr. Alvin, you're too careless.

245
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,750
You trusted someone who met
for the first time too much.

246
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,792
This...

247
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,792
Look at her weird dress-up. She's a witch.

248
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,792
It seems right after you say so.

249
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,333
And I'm a beauty.

250
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,833
I can't tell that.

251
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,833
Do you have any proof that I'm a witch?

252
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,542
Proof...

253
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,542
Just try to add the proof later.

254
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,750
What a rascal.

255
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,500
But is it really dangerous to trust strangers...
too much?

256
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,333
Oh no, the rare material...

257
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,917
I'm so sad.

258
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:15,167
I wanted to treat you to a delicious meal
when I reached home.

259
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,083
My son died of an infectious disease.

260
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,583
My husband died early. I'm so lonely.

261
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,625
I haven't felt warmth for a long time.

262
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,667
I just feel happy...

263
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,625
Do you think this will win our sympathy?

264
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,458
Who would believe your nonsense?

265
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,958
It's really not that simple.

266
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,458
But I suddenly feel hungry.

267
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,042
Come on. Get on.

268
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:43,833
Just pay with delicious food
for taking you home.

269
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,583
It's too simple.

270
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,250
Here's my house.

271
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,625
Sorry for bothering you.

272
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,083
There are so many books.

273
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,042
It'll be easy to burn.

274
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,083
Is it a crime preview?

275
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,167
You may sit anywhere.

276
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,250
I'll prepare the drinks.

277
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,917
Thank you.

278
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,167
Phew.

279
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,250
I'll have a glass of raw first.

280
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,542
Are you an old man?

281
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,292
And what's the raw thing?

282
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,625
Fresh lettuce juice.

283
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,167
Troublesome brats.

284
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:29,750
Forget it. Let them settle down with herbal tea
with paralytic poison.

285
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,917
Here you go. Have some herbal tea.

286
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,500
Is it a legal "herb"?

287
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,750
Illegal elf, shut up.

288
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,250
Sorry, she's a little self-righteous.

289
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,583
It's good to be energetic.

290
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,583
Come on. Please drink herbal tea.

291
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,042
Okay. Thank you for that.

292
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,000
Are you all right?

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,708
I'm okay. It just spilled on my clothes.

294
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,167
Well, are you okay?

295
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:03,667
No, I just want to lie down.

296
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,792
How loud.

297
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,208
And read a book by the way.

298
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,917
Get up and tidy up.

299
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,708
Old lady, go and get changed.

300
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,958
I'll clean here up.

301
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,333
Sorry for that.
The cleaning tools are over there.

302
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,708
Sheer dumb luck.

303
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,167
Mr. Alvin, here's the rag.

304
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,542
Oh, thank you.

305
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,542
Are you kidding me? That's my cloak.

306
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:28,125
Oh right, let's use that.

307
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,917
Well, hurry up and clean it up.

308
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:33,292
Clean the whole room by the way.

309
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,667
There's dust everywhere.

310
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:39,167
How rare that you say something decent.

311
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:43,417
It must be hard for the old lady
to clean up alone.

312
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:47,000
What's wrong with her?
She said some decent lines.

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,083
It won't be found out if I steal a few books
while it's messy.

314
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,375
It seems that I'm wrong.

315
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,792
What are you doing?

316
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,000
We want to clean the room by the way.

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm so sorry about that.

318
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,875
Old lady, what's that?

319
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,208
It's a scented candle.

320
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,417
Its fragrance can make you relax.

321
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,083
You are rare visitors to my house.

322
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,292
Have a good rest.

323
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,375
It's actually a candle with a sleeping effect.

324
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,792
I've taken the antidote, so I'll be fine.

325
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:21,750
If you smell it for ten minutes,
you'll feel strongly sleepy.

326
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,875
Be careful with the fire!

327
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,500
What... What if it burns the books?

328
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,625
Can't you remind us before you did it?

329
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,917
Sorry. I'm sorry.

330
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:40,042
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

331
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,250
Sorry, I have a strong sense
of disaster prevention.

332
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,167
Sorry, I can't stop this disaster.

333
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,542
I'll go and get changed.

334
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,875
What a relief. She's not angry.

335
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,542
How could there be such a miracle?

336
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,750
She's just too angry to curse you.

337
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,333
Hurry up and clean it up.

338
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,875
When she comes back, kneel and apologize.
Then leave quickly.

339
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,083
Aren't we going to have delicious food
with the old lady?

340
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,208
Who could eat together
in such an awkward atmosphere?

341
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,250
Why are you so flustered?

342
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,792
Old lady, you're back.

343
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:17,750
You agreed to eat the dish I made.

344
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,625
But we're about to leave.

345
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,375
Shut up and eat.

346
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,292
She's really angry.

347
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:28,958
And what's in that pot?
It'll definitely kill us.

348
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,750
It looks terrible.

349
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,333
I looked forward to it.

350
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,583
And she continues to freeze the atmosphere.

351
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,958
Can I cast a spell on it to make it delicious?

352
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,333
I remember the spell is...

353
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,625
Become delicious, Moe Moe...

354
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,833
Kyun.

355
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,333
Get out of here, please.

356
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,417
What do you want to do?

357
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,958
Didn't I ask you to get out?

358
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,000
Why are you still here?

359
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,417
You can tell by looking at me.

360
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,000
Cooking, of course.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,250
I think it means something else.

362
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,333
I was unlucky just now. I flipped your food.

363
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,250
To make up for it,

364
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,333
I want to cook

365
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,042
by using your ingredients.

366
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,167
How annoying.

367
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,958
-Can I decline it?
-No.

368
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,167
Carla, have you ever done cooking?

369
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,125
No.

370
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,208
I think so.

371
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,125
But I can eat.

372
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,458
I think so.

373
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,500
Whatever. The ingredients are
in the store at the back.

374
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,542
Thank you, old lady.

375
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,333
Is it all right?

376
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,417
She won't listen to anything, anyway.

377
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:57,375
Then let her finish quickly.

378
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,292
I hope it can finish safely.

379
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,208
Sorry to keep you waiting.

380
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,083
Mr. Alvin, it's great.

381
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,292
There are many ingredients
I haven't seen before.

382
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,667
We've seen it before!

383
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,708
Where have you been?

384
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,875
After coming out of the beginner dungeon,
I went after butterflies.

385
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,542
Then I got lost.

386
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,542
Carla, you don't want to cook him, do you?

387
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,625
No, not today.

388
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,417
Not for all your life.

389
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,042
What do you want to do?

390
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,708
Making a legend.

391
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,792
I don't have time for your nonsense.

392
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,292
Don't touch me.

393
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,542
Old lady, this way, please.

394
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,875
Please stand here. Don't move.

395
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,917
What? Aren't you going to cook?

396
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:46,875
Emergency food...
Altargaia, please help me.

397
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,625
Okay, got it.

398
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,500
Put this ingredient here.
Put this ingredient there.

399
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,042
Okay, that's about it.

400
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,167
What are you going to do?

401
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,542
The so-called cooking is processing ingredients.

402
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:03,625
I'm going to complete the processing with magic.

403
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,917
Can this be considered cooking?

404
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,042
Don't worry.

405
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:11,167
The food I cook is absolutely edible. Probably.

406
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,458
Nice.

407
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,583
It's not nice.

408
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,417
What's that? The old lady was eaten.

409
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,833
I said "absolutely edible."

410
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,667
Who wants to be an "edible" ingredient?

411
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,792
What kind of weird food is this?

412
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:37,458
That's a nice name.

413
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,917
It looks awful, okay?

414
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,917
I think I just heard something.

415
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,333
It looks like it's ready.

416
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,542
Old lady, are you okay?

417
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,708
You haven't been digested, have you?

418
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,875
What's wrong with me...

419
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,917
Who are you?

420
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,750
It's the old lady.

421
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,708
She doesn't look like the old lady at all.

422
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,583
Because I chose ingredients with beauty effects.

423
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,042
It's beyond the realm of beauty effects.

424
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,333
Please look.

425
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,875
What... What's going on?

426
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,208
Rejuvenation. How is that possible?

427
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,333
Rejuvenation magic. No, it's a ritual.

428
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:25,958
Whatever it is, the operation of retrospective
style only appears in legends or stories.

429
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,792
Who exactly are you?

430
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:33,708
All right. Please bear in mind.

431
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,042
-Standing like a Chinese peony.
-Stressful Rafflesia.

432
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:38,417
-Sitting like a Moutan peony.
-Disappointing flytrap.

433
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,833
-Running like a lily.
-Devastating pitcher plant.

434
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,708
The name is...

435
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,208
Self-proclaimed.

436
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,625
The cleric, Carla.

437
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,625
-Geez.
-What?

438
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,500
You're so annoying.

439
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,000
-What a good tacit understanding.
-I was telling the truth.

440
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,208
"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW"
I'll report the title of the next episode.

441
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,417
"BUT ALVIN WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. MISFORTUNES NEVER COME
SINGLY." Gosh, do they read titles with so many words?

442
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,625
ALVIN ALSO HAD TO TAKE OFF HIS ARMOR AND REST. THE TWO BEGAN
TO QUARREL AGAIN. THEIR RELATIONSHIP MIGHT CHANGE.

443
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,333
"THE QUARREL BETWEEN ALVIN AND CARLA"
Not only were they attacked by thieves

444
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,625
"IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS WORK."
during the journey, but they also met a golem.

445
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,625
"BUT IN THIS ERA, WHETHER IT'S ROLE AUDITION OR RECORDING,"
Alvin and Carla overcame many obstacles

446
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,833
"ACCESS TO THE RECORDING STUDIO IS VERY LIMITED."
as before.

447
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,167
"ALL WORKED TOGETHER TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES.
THAT'S EPISODE SIX." But... There are too many words.

448
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,042
"STAY TUNED"
Who reads...
