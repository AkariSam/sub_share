1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,667
There are many monsters threatening humans.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,458
Many brave adventurers stepped forward bravely.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,542
And I,

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,542
Alvin, is one of them.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,167
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,417
let's continue the adventure today.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:43,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

8
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,458
THE TITLE "NOT ONLY WERE THEY ATTACKED BY A ROBBER
DURING THE JOURNEY, BUT THEY ALSO MET A GOLEM."

9
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,917
"ALVIN AND CARLA OVERCAME MANY OBSTACLES AS BEFORE."
That old lady

10
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,958
"BUT ALVIN WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. MISFORTUNES NEVER
COME SINGLY." gave us so many herbs and food.

11
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,583
"ALVIN ALSO HAD TO TAKE OFF HIS ARMOR AND REST."
It's enough for us.

12
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,458
"THE TWO BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN.
THEIR RELATIONSHIP MIGHT CHANGE." Yes.

13
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,708
"THE QUARREL BETWEEN ALVIN AND CARLA"
I completed the guild task

14
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:04,958
"IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS WORK."
thanks to her.

15
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,917
"BUT IN THIS ERA, WHETHER IT'S ROLE AUDITION OR RECORDING,
ACCESS TO THE RECORDING STUDIO IS VERY LIMITED." Honestly,

16
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,917
"ALL WORKED TOGETHER TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES. THAT'S
EPISODE SIX." I didn't know what to do when making her mad.

17
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,292
Be careful with the fire!

18
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,333
Kyun.

19
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,708
You made the old lady angry.

20
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:21,083
What's wrong with you? You've grown up.

21
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,750
You made her angry, okay?

22
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,333
But she was rejuvenated by Carla's magic.

23
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,333
She should be crying for joy.

24
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,667
Thank you, Lord Carla.

25
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:35,667
"LORD CARLA"
She called Carla "my Lord".

26
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,500
It's great to have a good ending.

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,458
All right. Let's go back to the guild
and hand in the herbs.

28
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,917
Carla, why are you so quiet?

29
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it a sign of the end of the world?

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,250
Sh.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,208
What's the matter, Sister Carla?

32
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,458
Is it terrible?
Is the world going to be destroyed?

33
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,708
Don't move!

34
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:03,833
If you wand too bee alife, leaf...

35
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,083
What?

36
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,250
Let me say it again.

37
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,208
Okay.

38
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,250
What's wrong with her?

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,125
Who knows?
I thought she was a robber or something.

40
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm going to say it.

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,958
Oh, okay!

42
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,625
Don't move!

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,250
If you want to be alive, leave the...

44
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:38,292
No, it's okay. Not bad.

45
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:44,167
One more time, one more time, one more time.

46
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,042
Stop clapping.

47
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,292
It's okay. I understood.

48
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:51,833
Leave the cart, right? Am I right?

49
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,958
Don't I have to start it over?

50
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,958
No, no.

51
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,792
So you'd leave the cart, right?

52
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,292
No.

53
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,417
"BOOS"
How stingy.

54
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:03,167
Duh! Life isn't that simple.

55
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,083
By the way, are you a robber?

56
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,375
It seems you're the only one.

57
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,042
I'm not the only one.

58
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,250
I'm the eldest among four sisters.

59
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,833
That's not what I meant.

60
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,542
Listen up!

61
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,708
Why did you suddenly shout?

62
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,167
You can't just come out like that.

63
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,083
You should hide and wait for the right time
to take action.

64
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,042
Since you have sisters,
you'd better rob in a group.

65
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,667
But my sisters are still young.

66
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,250
A monster is teaching a human
how to attack people.

67
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,167
I have a good idea.

68
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,708
And the naturally troublesome cleric.

69
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:44,792
Since there are more people,
you'd better take a hostage.

70
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:48,250
I'll let you take me hostage this time.

71
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,792
That's great. You're so nice.

72
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,917
But will the warrior let go of our discussion?

73
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:58,083
Don't worry. He's good at handling things
according to the situation.

74
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:02,917
Then... Is that how it feels?
Do you feel uncomfortable?

75
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,417
No.

76
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,000
Then try to threaten Mr. Alvin.

77
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,792
Don't move!

78
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,542
Oh no, somehow it just...

79
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,083
If you want to save her,

80
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,500
And then...

81
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,667
Just show your talent!

82
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,083
What a baffling request.

83
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,750
Be confident, Mr. Alvin.

84
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,833
It's funny anyway.

85
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,708
What do you mean?

86
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,250
I don't want to perform.

87
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,625
No. Why are you sitting down?
I said I'm not going to perform.

88
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:46,208
Stop it.
Don't be like you're going to watch a show!

89
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,958
Alvin. Alvin.

90
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,250
-Don't push me.
-Alvin. Alvin.

91
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:06,333
Alvin, Alvin...

92
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,750
Homeless dog.

93
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,333
Geez, close your eyes and wait.

94
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't open before I tell you to.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,417
And it has nothing to do with a homeless dog.

96
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,958
He's going to perform.

97
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,875
My talent…

98
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,250
Okay, I'm ready.

99
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,458
Check this out.

100
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,583
Headless horseman.

101
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,958
It's almost time to go back.

102
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,208
Okay.

103
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,958
Wait a minute.

104
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,458
Here you go.

105
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,708
Do you really want to give it to me?

106
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,000
As an apology for showing you boring talent.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,958
Thank you. Goodbye.

108
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,625
Be safe.

109
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,917
You're great indeed, Mr. Alvin.

110
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:19,625
Making others lose the will to fight.
That's your way of fighting, right?

111
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,375
Yes...

112
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,167
Geez.

113
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,542
No way. The golem is too strong.

114
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:50,583
Mr. Alvin.

115
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,125
Carla, step back.

116
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll buy you some time. Run away...

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,792
Impossible. You can't buy us any time.

118
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,125
Absolutely no way.

119
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,583
You deny it too much.

120
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,167
Not even if you were reborn.

121
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,667
How annoying you are.

122
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,208
Hey, you. I'm as a forward...

123
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,250
We're talking. Shut up!

124
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,917
All right.

125
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:22,833
Do you think you can fight with the golem
for more than ten seconds?

126
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,333
You can't, right?
Since you're not capable of doing it.

127
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,625
The answer hurts a lot, yet it's right.

128
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,250
However,

129
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,625
you have one thing that others don't.

130
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,417
Is it virtue?

131
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,750
How hilarious.

132
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,708
It's me. Yeah.

133
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,042
I want to lose it.

134
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,958
I'll assist you as a healer.

135
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,333
Beating a golem is a piece of cheese.

136
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,375
It should be a piece of cake.

137
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,000
Assist me?

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,333
Are you going to use killing magic?

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,583
It'll be all right this time.

140
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,333
I've grown after that.

141
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,667
Really?

142
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,917
Unlike someone who has stopped growing.

143
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,042
Don't point at others.

144
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,000
All right. The golem is waiting for you.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,125
I'll assist you well.

146
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,083
Will it really be all right?

147
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,542
I'll pick up your bones.

148
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,458
That's unlucky.

149
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,875
There's no way.

150
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,917
I wish you success in battle.

151
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,500
Golem.

152
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,208
I'm a man.

153
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,292
-I won't back down.
-Come on!

154
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,500
-Let's fight...
-Go for it, Mr. Alvin.

155
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,167
"ALVIN"
Go, go, Alvin.

156
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,792
"COME ON"
Come on, come on, Alvin.

157
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,667
"GO"
Let's go, Alvin.

158
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:46,583
Challenge a battle that you can't win
and recognize your strength.

159
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,125
Shut up!

160
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,375
How's the new magic, "yellow cheers"?

161
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,042
You're just adding trouble.

162
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,958
Your power is overwhelming, right?

163
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,208
My anger is overwhelming.

164
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,750
There should be other assistance magic.

165
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,542
Like increasing attack.

166
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:05,042
Strengthening defense.
The magic that's useful to the fight.

167
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,250
I see.

168
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,250
I'll buy an expensive sword
and shield from the town then.

169
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,292
I'll be right back.

170
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:13,833
No, no, no. It's not like that.

171
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,208
I did such a silly thing.

172
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,708
You haven't given me money, oops.

173
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,000
That's not what I meant.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,750
Since you're a healer,
you should use magic to assist me.

175
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,833
About this...

176
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,000
I think you can't beat the golem
even if I make you stronger.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,583
You hit a nerve in me.

178
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:37,875
Didn't you say it's a piece of cake?
But you can do nothing.

179
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,333
I still have a secret skill.

180
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,417
What's that?

181
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,083
You'll win with this, but...

182
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,708
I don't know why you're hesitating.

183
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,750
Since we get here, I'd sacrifice myself.

184
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,042
Let's work together to beat the golem.

185
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,625
Mr. Alvin.

186
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,292
I got it.

187
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,083
What?

188
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,042
I'll borrow the power of the earth spirits.

189
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,042
That sounds great.

190
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:13,542
It needs strong praying power for the spirits.

191
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,750
So let's pray together, Mr. Alvin.

192
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,375
Got it. We just have to pray, right?

193
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,417
Kneel and put your hands on the ground.

194
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,292
Keep your head down.

195
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,708
Sorry to keep you waiting.

196
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,208
Well...

197
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:34,125
I have something to tell you before the fight.

198
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,875
This warrior hopes you let him win.

199
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,333
Please.

200
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,750
How dare you trick me.

201
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,250
We almost reach the town.

202
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,333
It seems someone is missing.

203
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,708
Maybe he's chasing butterflies again.

204
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,875
It's that golem.

205
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,042
What? He's trying to tell us something.

206
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,875
What did you say?

207
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,167
Why do you understand?

208
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,625
So what did he say?

209
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,667
Just say it if you don't understand.

210
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:29,292
That's why I asked "what did you say?".

211
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:32,333
That's like you understood it. Fool.

212
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,708
Both of you, listen to me!

213
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,125
So you can talk?

214
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,917
I heard that monsters

215
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:43,500
would be highly intelligent and experienced
after living for a long time.

216
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,542
Don't explain it anymore.

217
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:49,708
Just follow me. It's urgent.

218
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,917
What's wrong with him?

219
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,375
He's poisoned.

220
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,792
I think a poisonous snake bit him.

221
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,917
Mushroom monsters should
have the ability to resist poison.

222
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:23,333
I'm an... edible... mushroom...

223
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,208
Oh, right...

224
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,250
Are you okay? Do you have anything to say?

225
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,833
Detoxification way...

226
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,250
Don't talk.
The poison will circulate all over the body.

227
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,708
Please don't say it's the last goodbye.

228
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,542
He didn't say that.

229
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:49,167
Sobbing, I wish, sobbing, in the next life,
sobbing, we'll meet again, sobbing.

230
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,917
Don't give up curing him.

231
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,958
It's the first time I've seen someone sobbing.

232
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,958
Others usually give up at this time.

233
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,000
Luckily I'm here.

234
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:05,833
Look at his look of despair.

235
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,458
Let me show you

236
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,042
holy power in the super healing list.

237
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:12,375
Are you sure it's not a blacklist?

238
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,417
Have you forgotten that
I rejuvenated the old lady young?

239
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,583
But I also remember your killing magic.

240
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,833
Are you ready?

241
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,750
Whatever.

242
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,958
He's ready for death.

243
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:30,167
Come and lean against this rock.

244
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,958
Right. Take it slow.

245
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,208
It looks like...

246
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,292
It's okay. Calm down.

247
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,750
I'm sorry...

248
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,917
She kind of does look like a healer...

249
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,083
I'll put you to sleep right away.

250
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,542
No way. Her choice of words is like a devil.

251
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:54,375
With my holy left hand.

252
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,208
What are you doing?

253
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,792
What are you doing with your hand in his mouth?

254
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:15,917
Stop it!

255
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,167
No, it's detoxification magic.

256
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,625
You're torturing him.

257
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,625
It's okay. I just let him spit out the poison.

258
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,542
Don't dig out his guts.

259
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:31,833
It works. You spit the poison out.

260
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,458
How is it? How do you feel?

261
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,250
I feel... much better...

262
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,667
You're a healer indeed.
I thought I was going to die.

263
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,708
Don't be like that.

264
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,417
I'm tired of being praised

265
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,792
as a goddess of healing.

266
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,375
Look, Mr. Alvin.

267
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,667
I did something like a great healer...

268
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,708
Medical officer!

269
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,208
It's raining.

270
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,583
There's a cabin nearby. Let's get there.

271
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,875
Okay.

272
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,792
Golem, sorry for troubling you.

273
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,583
Thank you for carrying Alvin.

274
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,958
I don't know when we'll get to the cabin

275
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,750
if Sister Carla piggybacks him.

276
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,667
Thank you very much.

277
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,958
It's no big deal.

278
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,375
Let's help each other when we're in trouble.

279
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,250
I can't go into the cabin. I'll leave first.

280
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,125
Well, we'll thank you later.

281
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,375
Goodbye.

282
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,667
I'm going to pick some detoxifying herbs.

283
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,042
Sister.

284
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,917
You two get along well.

285
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,500
Fine.

286
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,958
By the way, push the cart inside.

287
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,042
Okay.

288
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,167
And give me the bag.

289
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,583
The bag?

290
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:10,167
What happened to me?

291
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,667
I remember the poisonous gas
spitted by the mushroom...

292
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,792
Where am I?

293
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,583
It looks like ruins... Is it a cabin?

294
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,583
You're awake.

295
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,167
Carla, you're here.

296
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,333
God has heard my prayers.

297
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,958
A heretic.

298
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,250
What a pity. I'm an angel. It's great, right?

299
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,750
You're indeed a heretic.

300
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,833
What's with your costume this time?

301
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,083
Does it suit me?

302
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,750
It suits you. You totally look like a heretic.

303
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,625
It's the official costume for prayers

304
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,792
to make Mr. Alvin recover.

305
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,250
Are you sure you're not treating me
as a living sacrifice?

306
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,750
What strange mask is that?

307
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,583
How rude.

308
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,667
Because...

309
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:09,042
I should find a more decent sacrifice.
Otherwise, it's impolite to God.

310
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,958
Crocodiles or goats or something.

311
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,292
Don't you think you're rude to me?

312
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,000
Hey, phew.

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,750
What's that?

314
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,125
How are you feeling?

315
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,875
A lot better.

316
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,083
But you didn't put your hand
in my mouth too, did you?

317
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,500
Sorry, I'm out of magic power.
I can't use that magic.

318
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,792
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,708
I'm saved.

320
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,333
How did you detoxify me?

321
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,750
With my prayers.

322
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:39,750
It seems it's not a strong poison.

323
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,583
Your face still doesn't look good.

324
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,250
It's my look.

325
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,583
Is that so?

326
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,167
That's it.

327
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,500
Lean your forehead over here.

328
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,625
It's fine. I'm okay.

329
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,208
It's the first time I've seen someone
confirm the temperature like this.

330
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,083
You still have body temperature.

331
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,333
I'd be bead if I didn't.

332
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,792
You'd better lie down and rest.

333
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,583
Cooler your forehead.

334
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,375
There you go.

335
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,458
Wring it out.

336
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,375
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,125
Don't wring it on my face.

338
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,583
Hey, you're a good man
who looks handsome even when wet.

339
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,333
It's not the right time to say that.

340
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,958
Forget it. Don't do anything.

341
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,750
Wait a minute.

342
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,208
Oh right, Mr. Alvin. Are you hungry?

343
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,833
Right, I didn't eat yet.

344
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,667
I'm a little hungry.

345
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,375
I knew it.

346
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,250
"HERBAL CUISINE"
So I've prepared.

347
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,417
There are many recipes using herbs in this book.

348
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,125
Let me have a look.

349
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,000
According to the recipe,

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,542
both healing and delicious dishes can be made.

351
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,542
Which one are you going to make?

352
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:08,292
Make... I didn't think that much.

353
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,125
How less you think...

354
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,667
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:18,250
I'm such a hasty, dull and foolish person.

356
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,667
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,750
You don't have to be so upset...

358
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,792
That's my charm, too.

359
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,375
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,250
Don't be upset so optimistically.

361
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,792
Forget it. Don't do anything. Just be quiet.

362
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,625
"SAD"
Okay.

363
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,542
And...

364
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,708
Well... That...

365
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,250
Thank you for considering me.

366
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,708
I appreciate your kindness.

367
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,000
I want to say thank you.

368
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:05,500
Why... Why are you thanking me while sleeping...

369
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,708
All right. Goodnight.

370
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,833
Goodnight.

371
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,333
Sister Carla.

372
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,375
I've picked the detoxifying herbs.

373
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,583
Then Alvin should be able to recover...

374
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,833
Well. He seems already fine.

375
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,208
"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW"
Title of the next episode.

376
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,167
THERE'S NO OTHER MAJOR FEMALE ROLE EXCEPT CARLA IN
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER. IN A WAY, IT'S A SPECIAL SHOW.

377
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,333
"AFTER EPISODE 5, THE WITCH AND THE ROBBER GIRL APPEARED."
Can you stop making meaningless efforts?

378
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,667
"BUT THE YOUNG-LOOKING WITCH ONLY APPEARED FOR A WHILE
AT THE END." It can't be finished within 15 seconds.

379
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,750
"AND THE ROBBER GIRL WILL NOT APPEAR AGAIN."
Are you a fool?

380
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,917
"IT'S TIME TO LET THE NEW FEMALE ROLE APPEAR TO MEET
EVERYONE'S PREDICTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS." Right.

381
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,667
"SORRY TO KEEP EVERYONE WAITING. THERE'LL BE
A NEW FEMALE ROLE THIS TIME." Oh, it's from the superior.

382
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,583
MARIA DESFREM. BUT ENJOY THE ZOMBIE STORY FIRST.
WILL IT MEET EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS?

383
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,083
"PLEASE LOOK FORWARD TO EPISODE SEVEN. STAY TUNED."
You don't have to read the preview anymore...
