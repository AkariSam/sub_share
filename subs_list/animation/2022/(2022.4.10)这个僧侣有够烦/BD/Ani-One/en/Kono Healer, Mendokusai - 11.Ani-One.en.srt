1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,667
There are many monsters threatening humans.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,458
Many brave adventurers stepped forward bravely.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,542
And I,

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,542
Alvin, is one of them.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,167
Forming a party with the healer Carla,

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,417
let's continue the adventure today.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:43,208
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

8
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,417
THE TITLE "THE SECOND PART OF
"WHAT'S THIS STORY" MAKES ANNA AND RYOKO,"

9
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,708
WHO AREN'T IN THE ORIGINAL WORK "DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER", 
ACTIVE IN THE ANIMATION. IT'S EXCITING. THANK YOU FOR

10
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:56,750
MAKING UP THE INSUFFICIENT PART OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IN THE
ANIMATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, A POPULAR ANIMATION APPEARED

11
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,417
IN THIS EPISODE. I BELIEVE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WITHOUT
EXPLAINING IT. "OPEN IT IF YOU DARE. COME ON."

12
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,542
"IN THOSE DAYS, INSTEAD OF USING A DIGITAL BRUSH,"
This is... a treasure box, right?

13
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:02,500
"REAL DRAWING TOOLS WERE USED TO DRAW OUTLINES AND COLOUR."
Right.

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,208
"IT MAY BE GOOD TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT
THE STAFF BACK THEN REALLY WORKED HARD AND" But...

15
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,708
"HAD BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT ANIMATION. THAT'S EPISODE 11."
I didn't expect to be provoked by the treasure box one day.

16
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,833
"OPEN IT IF YOU DARE. COME ON."
No, I was provoked by the plate.

17
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,500
That's great. It's a rare experience.

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,708
It really annoys me.

19
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:20,333
The treasure box is in the middle of the
main road. There's obviously something wrong.

20
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,500
It's strange indeed.

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,833
Okay. Let's open it.

22
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,542
That's the strange point.

23
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,042
Don't we open it?

24
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:32,792
We're adventurers. We can't have
any leftovers. So we should open it.

25
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,333
Go pick up the remaining dishes.

26
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:38,750
Which fool would particularly open
such an obviously doubtful treasure box?

27
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,833
Maybe it's just you who'd open it, you fool.

28
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:46,000
You're too much.
You just called me a fool, didn't you?

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,042
Hold on. It could be alpaca.

30
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:51,042
You just called me an alpaca, didn't you?

31
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,250
I said you're a fool.

32
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,542
You said fool...

33
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,792
No matter how many times you ask me,
I've said it.

34
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:03,292
Do you mean stupidly cute when you said fool?

35
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,708
I'll give you one more chance.

36
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,458
No.

37
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,667
Please.

38
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,708
No.

39
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,375
I'm begging you.

40
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,958
What are you doing? Don't pull! Let go of it!

41
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,417
-Both of you.
-What's wrong?

42
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:17,958
I've just seen it with thief skills.

43
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,792
There seems to be no trap in the treasure box.

44
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,667
But it's obviously suspicious.

45
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:29,125
Was it made obviously on purpose?
No one dares to open it instead.

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,292
I'm not sure why,
but there may be treasure in it.

47
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:35,417
No. How could it be...

48
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,875
But there's a possibility
of one in ten thousand.

49
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,375
Open the treasure box when you see it...

50
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,958
Open it. Open it. Open it.

51
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:48,250
-Bristle brush. Bristle brush. Bristle brush.
-Don't urge me by beating time.

52
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,042
Since there's no trap, let's open it.

53
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,792
I guess it's just a prank.

54
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,458
When we open it and see nothing,
we'll rejoice too soon.

55
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,208
It's possible.

56
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,250
Bristle brush...

57
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,417
Wait a minute.

58
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:05,375
There's no trap in the treasure box...

59
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:13,708
But the trap could be around the treasure box.
So be careful.

60
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,417
Too late.

61
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:19,017
As expected of one of Alvin's 18 martial arts,

62
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,708
falling into a hole.

63
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,458
Are... Are you all right?

64
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,083
Are you hurt?

65
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,708
What a special way of showing care.

66
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,208
Can you come out?

67
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,833
Let me try.

68
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,667
I can't.

69
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,375
I thought of something.

70
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,375
What's it?

71
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,875
"THE TWO SPLIT UP TO COLLECT HERBS AND MOUNTAIN VEGETABLES"
Altargaia is good at picking herbs and mountain vegetables.

72
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,208
This is very effective for diarrhea.

73
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,625
We picked a lot.

74
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,292
Ryoko's storage skills are excellent.

75
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:05,417
And I at least have thief skills.

76
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,542
Carla is a cleric.

77
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,458
This is open to question.

78
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,333
-Objection.
-Silence.

79
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:16,500
Anyway, everyone has their own
characteristics and skills.

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,375
Stop it.

81
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,125
Meanwhile, you...

82
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,375
Anna!

83
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,167
Stop saying that.

84
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,708
Please don't get rid of the soil on my head.

85
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,167
Don't judge a person's value
by whether he can be of help.

86
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,000
And are you standing on my cape?

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,500
And Mr. Alvin has many strong points.

88
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,167
Tell me about it.

89
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:39,625
It's... It's that... Right?

90
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,042
That was vague.

91
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,042
That's not it.

92
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,667
You have too many strong points
that I don't know what to say.

93
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,583
I counted slightly.
You have about 200 million strong points.

94
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,333
Nonsense. Probably not even one...

95
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,833
No. Two hundred million.

96
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,583
This is the unit that children use
when they lie.

97
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,208
At least you say hundred.

98
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,542
Hundred? You feel good about yourself.

99
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,250
That's right.

100
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,167
Forget it.
I don't have any strong points, anyway.

101
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,833
That's not true.

102
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,958
Strong point one.

103
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,750
In case of emergency,
your armour can be used for barbecue.

104
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,625
What on earth? What strong point is that?

105
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,417
Strong point two.

106
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,750
Listen to me.

107
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,750
That's all?

108
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,667
I've got it! How about this?

109
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,875
It can be used to grill fish.

110
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,292
No more, right?

111
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:31,583
Carla, Carla. That's not it.

112
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,750
Oh, I forgot the most important thing.

113
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,583
Apply oil first.

114
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,250
Or it'll get burnt.

115
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,958
The order doesn't matter!

116
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,958
Why do you regard my equipment
as a cooking tool? That's not right.

117
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,750
You're talking about
my strong points, aren't you?

118
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,000
Just say something like gentle at this time.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,625
What? Can even vegetables be grilled?

120
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,875
What a civilized good tool!

121
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,083
Get rid of your earwax!

122
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,125
Don't get too tired.

123
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,042
What are you doing?

124
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:21,292
How? Can you come out?

125
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,875
You wish.

126
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,292
How weird.

127
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:25,875
Are you saying you're weird?

128
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:30,083
Normally, when I say "Bang",
the sapling will grow out of the ground.

129
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,125
-Thump. You'll be pushed up.
-So it's not a dream.

130
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:37,333
It seems that I really can't compare
with the person concerned.

131
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,875
I sweat a lot.

132
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,042
The person concerned?

133
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,625
Don't you know that? It's famous.

134
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,667
I have no idea what you're talking about.

135
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,750
Carla is trying hard to help you.

136
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,583
You should be serious, too.

137
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:54,250
Well. I'm stuck. I can't move...

138
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,375
It seems that I can move.

139
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,167
-Look.
-I'm sorry.

140
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:01,458
Then I should be able to do it on my own.

141
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,500
Hang on a minute.

142
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,833
Let me help you.

143
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,000
Let. Me. Help. You.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,125
No, it's fine.

145
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,333
I should be able to come out if I try harder.

146
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,333
No. Don't make a pointless struggle.

147
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,708
No, I meant it.

148
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,292
No, please feel free.

149
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,250
If you're not careful,
your upper and lower bodies will be separated.

150
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,625
Leave it to me.

151
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,917
They won't be separated. I don't need it.

152
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,500
No. Most likely, they'll be separated.

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,917
Look at the atmosphere, okay?

154
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,708
Carla must be trying to help you.

155
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,542
How troublesome.

156
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,500
All right.

157
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,167
Carla, give me a hand.

158
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,708
Of... Of course, no problem.

159
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,542
Carla?

160
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,250
All right. I usually give him a lot of trouble.

161
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,292
Take this opportunity...

162
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:52,375
Do him a favour and make him
willing to accept my trouble in the future.

163
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,000
Good things never come too late.
Hurry and ask me for help...

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,917
I'm so dirty.

165
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,042
Let's find a place to rinse.

166
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,667
You tricked my mood!

167
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,500
Anyway, you're probably thinking
about unimportant things.

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,625
Devil, ghost animal, demon, heretic,
evil wisdom king, evil emperor,

169
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,625
-evil spirits, a man bewitched by darkness,
-Well. Hold on.

170
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,583
-the Paladin of Light...
-There's a good compliment!

171
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,708
These names are well fit for you.
I'm so hesitant.

172
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,167
Shameful Knight Parade.

173
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,833
All right...

174
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,458
Don't we open it?

175
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,125
The treasure box itself has no traps.

176
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:34,583
That means if we don't open it,
the treasure box will always be here.

177
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,625
But there are many traps around it.

178
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,583
It means someone put
the treasure box here with ill will.

179
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:45,375
Then there's no need to open it.
It was just a prank anyway.

180
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,833
You're scared.

181
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,667
You want to leave early because
you were caught in the boring trap, right?

182
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,333
It's already over.

183
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,000
I can do nothing with you.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,958
It seems that our vanguard is a coward.

185
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,042
All right. I'll open it for you.

186
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:06,250
Coward, just step back.

187
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,083
Although I don't expect anything
from the treasure box,

188
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,167
I don't know what ghosts and monsters
will appear in it.

189
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,125
Maybe it's just an ordinary snake

190
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,417
or a powerful snake.

191
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:18,625
No. Maybe it's an eight-headed
and eight-tailed serpent.

192
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,208
What are you doing?

193
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,500
I couldn't help myself...

194
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,542
Don't yell so loudly all of a sudden!

195
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:28,542
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,708
I won't forgive you!

197
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,083
Unforgivable. Resort to legal means.

198
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,875
There it appears.
The profound meaning of ancient martial arts.

199
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,542
You're doomed. I'll see you in court.

200
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,042
Excuse me. Who are you?

201
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,708
Who am I?

202
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,083
I'm a mimic, Nakami.

203
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,542
Nakami?

204
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,208
How come?

205
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,708
What's wrong?

206
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,958
I've been in place since three days ago.

207
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,833
All I did was in vain.

208
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,667
I didn't mean that.

209
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,167
You're too much. It's so poor.

210
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,208
Phoenix Hall of The Inhuman Temple.

211
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:14,250
You just fell into a meaningless trap hole.
It was a waste of time.

212
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,375
I should be the interesting part.

213
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,542
Isn't there no trap?

214
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:23,292
If I scare someone, I can level up smoothly.

215
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:26,042
My trap detection doesn't respond to mimics.

216
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,542
I'm going to get a pay cut.

217
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,917
Anna, he's not sensible yet.

218
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,458
Are you listening to me?

219
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,750
Sorry, our newbie owes you.

220
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,875
He's not mature yet. Please forgive him.

221
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:45,208
But as a cooking tool, he's an excellent tool.

222
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,792
What kind of compliment is that?

223
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,625
And you seem to have mistaken it.

224
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,375
It was a rehearsal just now.

225
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,917
A rehearsal?

226
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,833
Of course.

227
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,708
Even well-known dancers

228
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,750
can't go on stage without rehearsal.

229
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,000
Professionals should come on stage
after rehearsal.

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
It makes sense.

231
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,833
No wonder I find it strange.

232
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,542
So it was a rehearsal.

233
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,792
That's why he fell into the hole
to check the condition of the hole.

234
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:19,708
That's right. Who would be so dull
to fall into a hole like that?

235
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,542
Right.

236
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:24,417
Not everyone is a dull adventurer
newbie level 100.

237
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,708
OPEN IT IF YOU DARE. COME ON.

238
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,708
Then it's a formal one.

239
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,458
Yes.

240
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,083
Okay. I'll show you my real terrifying power.

241
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,792
I'll also show a surprising way
that can't be compared just now, too.

242
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,417
I'm looking forward to it.

243
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,958
End it quickly, okay?

244
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,083
I can't wait for it.

245
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,375
It's upside down.

246
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:52,042
Okay. Let's start from where Carla
walks to the treasure box.

247
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:54,292
Six seconds before shooting.

248
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,000
Five, four, three...

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,833
I didn't expect there was a treasure box here.

250
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,042
Huh?

251
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,875
She probably doesn't understand countdown.

252
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,292
How lucky.

253
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,167
I must have done a lot of good deeds.

254
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,083
All right. Let's open it.

255
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,458
I'm going to open it.

256
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,583
Open it in three seconds.

257
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,167
Count down three seconds. Okay.

258
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,333
-Ten, nine...
-Starting from ten.

259
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,792
Hold on. There may be a mimic
in the treasure box.

260
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:27,417
She's so sharp. She found it out.

261
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:30,292
We would be in trouble.

262
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,458
I heard that mimic is a terrifying monster.

263
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,250
It looks like an actual nightmare.

264
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,542
It has six arms and eight feet.

265
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,792
There are many tentacles on its head.

266
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,833
Even without the above features,
at least it won't be a monster

267
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:51,208
with an eye and a small horn that
a child can deal with in a picture book.

268
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,458
There are no such silly monsters among mimics.

269
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,958
Even if it's one of them,
its gesture is just an illusion.

270
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,625
Its original appearance is a horrible monster.

271
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,083
If it shows up here,

272
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,833
it'll show an amazing and frightening gesture
of terror and vigour.

273
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,708
I tremble with fear just by imagining it.

274
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:17,375
But as an adventurer, I have to
open the treasure box when I see it.

275
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,417
I'll open it even if the monster
hides in the treasure box.

276
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,208
Namo...

277
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,208
It's locked.

278
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,958
Lock of soul.

279
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,667
My bone may have cracked.

280
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,167
The worst case could be a fracture.

281
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,833
It's bloated. Does it hurt?

282
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,333
I took relieving herbs, so it doesn't hurt.

283
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,833
But it's a fortune in misfortune
to get only a little hurt.

284
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,750
It was frightening.

285
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,833
I didn't expect to meet a Cyclops.

286
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:08,000
And she was changing her clothes.

287
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,250
She hit without even asking.

288
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,417
Fortunately, I dodged at the critical moment.

289
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,625
Of course, she'd be angry
as we saw her changing clothes.

290
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,875
She's a girl.

291
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,625
The fact that she's a girl scares me even more.

292
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,167
And this time, it was really Carla who saved me.

293
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,500
It would be terrible without Carla.

294
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,833
Not at all. I did nothing...

295
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,042
Carla, don't be humble.

296
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:42,458
Well. Then...

297
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,458
Worship me.

298
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,292
You'd better be humble.

299
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,833
But it's all thanks to Carla...

300
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,208
Are you all right?

301
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,750
My goodness. It hurts just by grazing it.

302
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,333
Anyway, let's try to escape...

303
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,333
Carla.

304
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,208
Stop there.

305
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,667
You fool, step back!

306
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,708
Carla, what are you going to do?

307
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,083
Is your underwear the latest style this year?

308
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,625
What are you talking about?

309
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,458
Look at her expression.
Cyclops full of question marks.

310
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,042
Did you tell that?

311
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,542
It actually makes sense?

312
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,875
Of course, I can tell that.

313
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,458
That's the brand "Charm of Dwarves" of Miyako.

314
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,208
You've got good taste.

315
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,250
Oh, you know it so well.

316
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,208
That's right. I'll fight with the vigilante
in the village ahead later.

317
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,167
So it's underwear battle.

318
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,208
-All right. Men, wait by the side.
-It's a must to wear pink clothes in spring.

319
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,083
-Now it's girls' talk.
-It looks good on you.

320
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,000
Is this how the underwear battle to be?

321
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,792
Thanks to Carla for distracting her.
We're safe...

322
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,875
Right. Safe...

323
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,375
There was no enthusiastic battle
that made us nervous and sweaty.

324
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,333
No, there wasn't even a dispute.

325
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:57,292
Sorry, I'm more capable than a certain vanguard.

326
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,542
Stop it.

327
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,417
By the way, where's the monster?

328
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:04,375
Anyway, I exchanged contact details with her.

329
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,083
Let's go shopping next time.

330
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,542
Your negotiation ability is surprisingly high.

331
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:13,000
It doesn't matter.
You have to be healed quickly.

332
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,875
How? Do you want to use
the correct healing magic?

333
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,542
She's a healer, after all.
It's normal, isn't it?

334
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,000
You protected me just now...

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,458
No. It's important to heal you first.

336
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,375
I'll leave it to you.

337
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,583
You're too loud!

338
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,292
Do you have to be so serious?

339
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:47,583
Geez!

340
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,208
Hold on! Stop! Stop it now!

341
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,583
And don't exaggerate!

342
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,875
Achoo!

343
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,792
Stop it!

344
00:17:55,792 --> 00:18:00,792
What? I'm trying to heal you.
Why did you ask me to stop?

345
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,083
I'm angry.

346
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:06,500
Nonsense. Who would use healing magic
and yell at the same time?

347
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,333
And what does "Achoo" mean?

348
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,625
There's no choice. I'll be serious now.

349
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,958
So what were you doing?

350
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,750
Ryoko, can you get me a cloth?

351
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,000
Carla, here you are.

352
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,167
Ryoko has completely become an item box.

353
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:27,375
That's because Ryoko has high storage skills.

354
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you for your compliment.

355
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,083
Is it counted as storage?

356
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,500
What are you going to do with this cloth?

357
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,208
Just watch.

358
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,750
It's ordinary cloth.

359
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,042
Cover the wound.

360
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,958
Transfer power to it.

361
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,208
Count to three and remove the cloth.

362
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,125
It's almost the same as before.

363
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,167
One.

364
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,000
Two.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,417
You really don't know how to count down.

366
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,167
What? The swelling goes down.

367
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,208
My skin is shiny and elastic.

368
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,625
Is this a magic trick?

369
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,125
Power of hands.

370
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,208
That's amazing!

371
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,542
Am I be surprised or something?

372
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,500
What are you talking about?

373
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,375
Seeing you use normal healing magic,

374
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,500
I wonder if it's normal.

375
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,208
Do you think I can't use magic normally?

376
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,583
It's been like this so far.

377
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:31,167
So you always think I'm a girl
full of maternal intellect and love.

378
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,208
Oh, my.

379
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,792
I don't think so.

380
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,875
But to be honest, you're incredible.

381
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,458
Your magic skills seem really strong.

382
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,708
You have a bad personality, though.

383
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,875
Over there.

384
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,667
-I'm still a starless adventurer 
-Over there.

385
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,083
-at my age.
-Geez.

386
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,042
Other adventurers even called me
a veteran rookie.

387
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:55,750
But recently, I suddenly feel like
I'm getting along with a freak like you.

388
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,750
Over there.

389
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,042
If you were an ordinary and serious person,
you would have formed a party with others.

390
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,083
And I'd continue to fight alone.

391
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,500
Don't run.

392
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm often attacked mentally by you, though.

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
Well... How should I put it...

394
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,625
-Anyway...
-Don't run.

395
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,917
-Thank you.
-Don't run. Don't run.

396
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,750
I'm looking forward to working with you.

397
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
How strange. Where does she go?

398
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,833
Please don't thank me so seriously.

399
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,917
And... And I should be...

400
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:33,125
Thanks for forming a party with me.

401
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,042
Well... That...

402
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,833
You should thank me well.

403
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,625
That's what's annoying.

404
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,375
It's about time to leave.

405
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,458
Help!

406
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,250
Help...

407
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,958
I'm the village head of the dwarves.

408
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,167
Dark Wizard Dolman.

409
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:04,792
I attacked the village to get
the imperial body of the village.

410
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:08,833
The world will be destroyed
if the imperial body is taken away by Dolman.

411
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,042
A hero full of courage.

412
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:15,833
Please stop Dolman. I'll leave it to you.

413
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,833
My grandfather is the village head.

414
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,417
He asked me to give the letter
to someone who looks gentle.

415
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:23,250
Then he let me run away.

416
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,417
All the villagers have been caught.

417
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,958
Please rescue them all.

418
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:34,542
Speaking of Dolman, he's the villain
who led the artificial army group.

419
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,125
Dolman.

420
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,375
I've heard about him.

421
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,542
Five stars, no...

422
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,917
He has very powerful magic power.

423
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:49,500
Zero-star Alvin with bracket laugh
may not be able to beat him.

424
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,583
NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW "FINALLY, IT COMES TO THE LAST EPISODE.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING TILL NOW. INCLUDING THE STAFF OF"

425
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,042
"THE ORIGINAL WEBSITE, WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR SINCERE
THANKS TO YOU." Wow, we were asked to read the preview.

426
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,875
"SINCE THERE'S NO FINAL ENDING IN THE ORIGINAL WORK,"
Because the next episode is the last episode.

427
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,708
"THIS EPISODE IS ALMOST ORIGINAL. BUT THE CONTENT IS ALSO
FROM THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR, TANNEN NI HAKKOU." Oh, yeah?

428
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,000
"THE LINES AND INSPIRATION OF DWARF CHARACTERS"
Don't you know that?

429
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,750
"ARE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE THE CONTENTS BEFORE AND AFTER."
We'll be knocked down by the enemy

430
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,667
"FINALLY, WE CAN REST ASSURED.
BUT IT'S LONELY TO END LIKE THIS." and aced.

431
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,417
"HOPEFULLY, CARLA AND ALVIN CAN CONTINUE TO GET ALONG."
No way!

432
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,083
"AND THE ORIGINAL STORY ISN'T OVER YET.
PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT." Please look forward to it.

433
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,625
"THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING.
THANKS AGAIN SINCERELY." I'm looking forward to it.

434
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,708
"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EPISODE TWELVE, "FINAL EPISODE"."
Please stay tuned!

435
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,125
"STAY TUNED."
We seem a little serious...
