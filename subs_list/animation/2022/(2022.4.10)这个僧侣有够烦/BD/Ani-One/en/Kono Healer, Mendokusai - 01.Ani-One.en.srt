1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,833
There are many monsters threatening humans

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,708
in the vast world where we live.

3
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:15,250
Many adventurers and heroes

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,833
stepped forward bravely.

5
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,833
They face many dangerous challenges today

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,000
to protect the people and the world.

7
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:31,458
And I, Alvin, is one of them.

8
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,292
I'm going to encounter a monster.

9
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:37,917
All right. Take this.

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:40,958
THE TITLE

11
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,708
ALVIN (MALE LEAD/ARMORED WARRIOR),
WHO IS TRYING TO BE AN ADVENTURER

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,458
IN A WORLD FULL OF DEMONS AND MONSTERS,
IS FIGHTING WITH A BEAR.

13
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,208
FORTUNATELY, Carla (FEMALE LEAD/DARK ELF),
A DARK ELF HEALER, HAPPENED TO PASS BY

14
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:43,958
WHEN HE WAS IN DANGER.
Carla'S CHARACTER IS VERY GOOD AT DEBATE.

15
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:44,708
THE BEAR WAS CONFUSED. THERE'S EVEN
A PLOT THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE COMIC.

16
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,458
THEY WENT BACK TO THE BEAR'S HOUSE.
THE COMIC FANS WILL BE WONDERING.

17
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,208
BUT THIS IS THE SAME WORLDVIEW STORY
PUBLISHED ONLINE, "WHAT'S THIS STORY"

18
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:46,958
BEFORE THE MAGAZINE SERIAL.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION

19
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:47,708
OF THE STAFF AND THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR.
BESIDES, SUCH A LONG TITLE IS UNSUITABLE

20
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:48,958
FOR STRAIGHT OR OBLIQUE SUBTITLES,
SO IT'S NOT DONE.

21
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:49,958
Geez.

22
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,125
It has such lovely eyes, yet it's so strong.

23
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:56,458
OF FIRST EPISODE

24
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,958
Oh, no.

25
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,958
I'm doomed.

26
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,500
Excuse me. Are you in trouble?

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,958
Nice to meet you. I'm Carla,

28
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,042
a dark elf healer.

29
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,208
Thank you for introducing yourself precisely.

30
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,250
I'm a human, Alvin.

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm kind of... a warrior...

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,958
But it's not the time to introduce myself.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Are you all right?

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,833
Do I look all right?

35
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,167
Don't just stand there. Help me.

36
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,500
When you ask someone a favor,

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,292
isn't it necessary to kneel and kowtow?

38
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,792
Huh, what's wrong?

40
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,167
People will usually help at this time.

41
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,375
Why should I kneel and kowtow?

42
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,708
Why are you shouting so loudly?

43
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,917
Are you feeling stressed out?

44
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:14,667
I'm getting stressed out now.

45
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,667
Are you going to vent your anger on me
as you're about to lose to the monster?

46
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,542
Please accept the fact that you're weak.

47
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,542
Shut up!

48
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,958
You're yelling again.

49
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,458
Humans are scary. Just die out.

50
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,750
There's no need to cry.

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,667
It's my bad for yelling at you.

52
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,542
"My bad."

53
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,333
You should say "I'm so sorry."

54
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,250
You…

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,583
No, I can't just listen to her.

56
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:47,000
I should calm down like a mature adult.

57
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,792
What about your "I'm so sorry"?

58
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:59,000
No, I'm going to lose my mind.

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,125
Oh no, I forgot it.

60
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,875
Give me a few more minutes.

61
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,958
All right. How about this?

62
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,333
You're Carla, right?

63
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,208
If you're willing to help, I'll do you a favor.

64
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,125
Anything will do?

65
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,917
I'll try my best.

66
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,042
Then kneel and kowtow.

67
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,708
Why are you persistent about this?

68
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,583
I wanted this, but forget it.

69
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,500
In contrast, Mr. Alvin.

70
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,833
Please form a party with me.

71
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,583
A party?

72
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,417
Actually, I've never formed a party before.

73
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,042
I think so. It's hard for your character.

74
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:37,208
No one seems to want to talk to me.

75
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:41,083
I may be the so-called
"flower at the top of a tall mountain".

76
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,000
You should be "poisonous weeds in a swamp".

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
You really can't blink.

78
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,625
It's okay to form a party.

79
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,458
Thank you, Mr. Alvin.

80
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,750
It'll be dissolved soon, anyway.

81
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,667
First of all, I'm an adventurer.
But my level isn't high.

82
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,250
Don't expect too much from me.

83
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,792
Okay. I expect nothing from you.

84
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,083
Your action and speech are completely different.

85
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,625
Don't give a thumbs up.

86
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,583
Anyway, please heal me quickly.

87
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,250
The economy?

88
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,667
My strength.

89
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,833
Your strength?

90
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,917
You've been yelling since just now.
You should be very energetic.

91
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,042
Watch your words.

92
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:18,083
I got it.

93
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,083
You want to be spoiled, right?

94
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,542
Could you hurry it up?

95
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,292
I wanted to lighten the atmosphere.

96
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:25,042
Did you?

97
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,375
But you're not talented at it.
Don't do so again.

98
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,417
All right, let's start.

99
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,458
What a nuisance.

100
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,750
Dissolve when the fight is over.

101
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,042
Don't move.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,083
Your heart is still moving.

103
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,833
If my heart stops, I'll die.

104
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,458
Don't yell so loudly all of a sudden.

105
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,333
I accidentally cursed you.

106
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,917
It's you who…

107
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,917
What did you say?

108
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,458
I accidentally cursed you.

109
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,250
Bleh, hey.

110
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,375
What kind of new healer put a curse?

111
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,958
Don't worry. It's not a great curse.

112
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,917
Really?

113
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:09,292
You'll die if you're 300 meters away from me.

114
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,708
Die…

115
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,833
Don't do so.

116
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,625
Even if you're happy,
you don't have to kneel before me.

117
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,958
It's strange for me.

118
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,875
I'm going despair.

119
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,125
What should I do?

120
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,458
So we can't be separated?

121
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,167
You're so mean. Were you just tricking me?

122
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,917
I'm mad because I have to take it seriously.

123
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,583
Both of you, please calm down.

124
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,667
Who's that?

125
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,875
It's not good to fight, kuma.

126
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:43,250
Alvin, don't be so harsh to a girl, bear.

127
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,000
Carla, you should think more
about others' feelings, roar.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,792
Since you two are a party, get along well, kuma.

129
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,875
Talk nicely, bear.

130
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,917
Okay? Roar.

131
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:56,042
Don't talk like a human, okay?

132
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,167
And keep the auxiliary words
at the end of the sentences consistent.

133
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,125
Cursing each other is not the way.
Let's have a good talk.

134
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,042
The topic is about

135
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:12,625
a warrior looking down on a healer.

136
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,125
Sorry, I've got something to say
since the beginning.

137
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,958
I have an objection to this topic.

138
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,458
And there's one more thing I care about.

139
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,542
What is it, the defendant?

140
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,333
My objection was approved.

141
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,625
But let's put it aside.

142
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,583
Why did the monster join too?

143
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,667
I'm sorry to hear that.

144
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:33,917
Do you think the monster isn't qualified
to join the discussion?

145
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:37,250
No, we were fighting just now.

146
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,583
That's so sad.

147
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,542
The lives of monsters and humans are equal.

148
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:45,583
Even though we look different, we should accept
each other in the spirit of indiscriminate love.

149
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,958
So we can understand each other.

150
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:52,167
Don't be like you remember
you're a healer suddenly, okay?

151
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,667
Excuse me, kuma.

152
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,750
Do you want to say something?

153
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,417
I heard that the longer a monster lives,
the wiser it will be.

154
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,208
And it has rich experience.

155
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,917
If it's a dragon, I can understand that.

156
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:10,625
Before you express your opinion,
may I have your name, please?

157
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,500
I'm so sorry.

158
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:19,708
But our race doesn't have the "name"
mentioned by humans, kuma.

159
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,708
Even if it has wisdom, it still can't
keep the end of the sentences consistent.

160
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,250
But humans call us

161
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,042
Oomune bears, bear.

162
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,458
It's too random.

163
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,750
Mr. Oomune Bear, do you have any idea?

164
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,708
Oh right, kuma.

165
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,750
From your dialogue just now, it's what I think.

166
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,292
First of all, Carla.

167
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:45,000
Carla's occupation is a healer.
It's easily to be targeted, kuma.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,917
The only occupation that can protect you
is warrior.

169
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:53,542
If the warrior collapses,
you'll also be in danger.

170
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,583
Carla, you're smart.

171
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:59,458
You should be clear about what to do, right?

172
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,000
And the defendant Alvin.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,250
The defendant…

174
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,792
Although you were in the fight,

175
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,917
you blurted out a lot of verbal violence.

176
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,750
Does its subtext convey an arrogant message

177
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,042
like "even if it's the first meeting" and
"a healer should restore strength

178
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:17,667
for a warrior", kuma?

179
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,875
The elves are very sensitive
to people's negative emotions.

180
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:26,250
Carla maybe unknowingly felt these emotions,
bear.

181
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,000
I said so much, roar.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,917
I mainly hope that since you've formed a party,

183
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,583
you two are important to each other.

184
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:40,542
Besides, Alvin can't stay more than
300 meters away from Carla.

185
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:45,625
You two should learn to respect
and tolerate each other in daily life, kuma.

186
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,958
So that's a monster that can speak like a human.

187
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,042
Since it has lived for such a long time,

188
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:53,708
its words are persuasive.

189
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,250
You.

190
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,875
It's saying something convincing.
Yet, you're dozing off.

191
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,583
I didn't doze off.

192
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,083
You did.

193
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,917
Don't you know the "sleep learning method"?

194
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,292
You just fell asleep.

195
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,708
Sit down!

196
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,250
- What do you want?
- Just sit down!

197
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,708
What's wrong with you since just now?

198
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,417
You simply cursed people.
And there's something wrong with your attitude.

199
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,083
Calm down, kuma.

200
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,958
No. To deal with such a person,
you have to scold her severely.

201
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,083
All right, roar.

202
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:28,292
You dozed off while someone else was talking.
That's so rude of you.

203
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,417
All right, kuma.

204
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:33,000
You can only do that
when the headmaster is giving a speech.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,833
All right.
You can't do so at that time too, bear.

206
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,500
What about the congressman?

207
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,750
It's even more unforgivable
to doze off at a national meeting.

208
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,083
You also can't do that when the headmaster
is giving a speech, kuma.

209
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,417
By the way, what are we talking about now, bear?

210
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,667
This monster has lived for a long time, right?

211
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,417
Well…

212
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,083
That means it's an elder.

213
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,833
"DARK ELF FEMALE 72 YEARS OLD"
You should respect it.

214
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,958
"ABOUT 14-15 YEARS OLD OF HUMAN AGE"
Right?

215
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,250
"OOMUNE BEAR MALE 324 YEARS OLD"
You should treat

216
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,083
"ABOUT 43-44 YEARS OLD OF HUMAN AGE"
the elderly gently.

217
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,917
"HUMAN MALE 30 YEARS OLD"
Treat older men

218
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,125
"WARRIOR LEVEL 7-8 YEARS OLD"
and older women well.

219
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,708
How…

220
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,833
How can you gossip about a lady's age, kuma?

221
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,542
My legs…

222
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,083
Paralysis.

223
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,667
It's paralysis, not paradise.

224
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,500
Oh no, kuma.

225
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,667
What should I do?

226
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:35,042
Oh, well…

227
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,042
Kuma!

228
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:41,292
Now you know the power of the monster, bear.

229
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,250
My legs are numb and painful.

230
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,750
I'm collapsing.

231
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,333
I seemed to have encountered something scary.

232
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,583
What a relief. You wake up, bear.

233
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,000
I just came back from picking oranges, kuma.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Eat the orange to recover your strength, roar.

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,583
Thank you.

236
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,167
It tastes good.

237
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,000
Is this your home?

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,583
Yes, it's my den, roar.

239
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,708
Den…

240
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,250
But it's great, bear.

241
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,167
You were injured badly
that you almost died, kuma.

242
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,917
I beat you, though, roar.

243
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,542
So you're a female.

244
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,500
Sorry for being rude.

245
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,750
I'm the one to apologize, bear.

246
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,500
Did you save me?

247
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,667
It's not me, kuma.

248
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,083
She seems sorry for you.

249
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,500
She has been casting recovery magic on you
to help you heal.

250
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,167
Recovery magic?

251
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,042
Is it morning?

252
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,667
I want bread for breakfast.

253
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,292
Add lots of sugar and milk to the coffee.

254
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,958
Add honey to the yogurt.

255
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,500
You demand so much.

256
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you dressing up like that?

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,208
"IT IS JUST AN IMPRESSION"
Put a five-inch nail on the doll

258
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,208
"IT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT Carla ACTUALLY DID"
to curse others.

259
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:29,542
Your injury is too severe. It's not enough
to cast recovery magic just once.

260
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,125
She tried her best to cast many times.

261
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,792
There are too many five-inch nails.

262
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:37,542
It's like magic needle therapy.

263
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,958
Your wound should have been healed, bear.

264
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,333
It's all thanks to Carla, kuma.

265
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,750
Although I'm okay now…

266
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,125
I don't get it.

267
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,792
Breakfast…

268
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:04,167
It seems that she cried as she felt relieved.

269
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,125
$^%@*&

270
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,917
She cried until uttering nonsense.

271
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,125
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

272
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,417
Why do you repeat it?

273
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,500
I tried very hard to use recovery magic.

274
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,667
But your injury is too severe.

275
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,417
Your body is finally cured.

276
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:24,542
But your face is still miserable…

277
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:27,042
Your words… Miserable face.

278
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:31,417
The wound on your face is severe. I think
at least return to your proper appearance.

279
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,292
Plastic surgery…

280
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:36,042
I tried to recover you back
to your original appearance.

281
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,833
But I don't know why

282
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,250
it turned out looking ugly.

283
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,583
Was I dissed?

284
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,792
No, she didn't diss you.

285
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,208
Are you bullying me together?

286
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,792
Why did the auxiliary word
at the end of the sentence change?

287
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,167
Your face is really miserable, kuma.

288
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,292
It's too late to save it.

289
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,708
Your words.

290
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,542
Please use this, bear.

291
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,542
You have a hand mirror.

292
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,708
It's a girl's habit, kuma.

293
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,750
A monster's habit...

294
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,917
Well, the wound on my face can't be cured...

295
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,417
I'm sorry. Sorry.

296
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,708
Do you like this method
of making an apology very much?

297
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,042
It's too serious to be treated…

298
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:18,083
It doesn't feel different touching it…

299
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,417
What?

300
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:20,708
Kuma.

301
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,708
Please don't hate Carla, bear.

302
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,125
She tried her very best to recover
your original appearance.

303
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,833
But her magic power wasn't enough.

304
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,917
That's why your look is semi-finished, bear.

305
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,167
Carla, don't cry, roar.

306
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:43,208
Come to think of it.
I haven't seen Mr. Alvin's face before.

307
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,458
It's not your fault, bear.

308
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,208
Just hate me if you want.

309
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,333
Just hate me, kuma.

310
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,958
- Roar…
- No, it's completely recovered.

311
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm used to being hated by humans, kuma.

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,583
It's all my fault, roar.

313
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:03,125
No, it's me. I don't have enough power.

314
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,583
I just said it.
It has recovered to its original state.

315
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,958
I even look good.

316
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,917
I just said it.

317
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,042
It has completely recovered
to my original appearance.

318
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,333
That's great. You're awake.

319
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,000
I've been awake long ago.

320
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,708
Are you going to act as nothing happened?

321
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,708
You've been injured so badly.

322
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,000
This is a miracle indeed.

323
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,833
What do you mean by looking ugly?

324
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,542
God, you're amazing. VIVA GOD.

325
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,667
What's a semi-finished look?

326
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,292
I'm amazing, too. VIVA Carla.

327
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:41,083
Roar.

328
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,083
I'll put the cape here, roar.

329
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,333
Thank you.

330
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:51,417
You have a lot of equipment.

331
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,417
I used to be young, kuma.

332
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:59,792
I fought with many adventurers
at that time, bear.

333
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,875
These are the spoils of war, roar.

334
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,958
It seems that as you grow older,
you'll become tactful...

335
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:15,542
I... I mean... The big city is still far away.

336
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,083
Alvin is such a sensible human, kuma.

337
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sure you can get along well
with Carla, roar.

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,958
I have no confidence in this.

339
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,750
You can do it, bear.

340
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,833
It's easy to hold.

341
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,750
I'll punish you in the name of God.

342
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,542
Holy Beam.

343
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,417
ALVIN'S CAPE

344
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,667
Are you two going to leave, bear?

345
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:00,500
Yes.

346
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,375
Don't go in such a hurry, kuma.

347
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,958
It's fate to meet each other.

348
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,042
Stay here tonight, bear.

349
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,083
That won't work.

350
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,083
I'm a human, you're a monster.

351
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,458
It's strange for us to get along well.

352
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,833
That's right, roar…

353
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,125
First of all.

354
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,750
I'm very competitive.

355
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,375
The attack came unprepared,
but I won't lose all the time.

356
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,083
Bear.

357
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,417
I'll challenge you again in the near future.

358
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,625
Get ready to welcome me.

359
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,208
Do you get it?

360
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,083
Roar. Roar.

361
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,333
Kuma! Kuma...

362
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,750
Human, you're pretty powerful, roar.

363
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay. I'll give you a grand welcome, bear.

364
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,667
Don't forget by then.

365
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,250
And remember to keep the auxiliary words
at the end of the sentences consistent.

366
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,458
Stop it.

367
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,875
You scared me, kuma.

368
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,750
Huh? What's wrong?

369
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,917
What do you think?

370
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,083
Why... Why do you have to fight?

371
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,375
Why? You get along well with each other.

372
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,833
Well, kuma…

373
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,042
Why did you make a promise to come back
and challenge?

374
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:27,083
- No, it's the atmosphere.
- No, it's the atmosphere, roar.

375
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:31,042
I thought monsters and humans
could live in peace.

376
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,458
No, you know it, right?

377
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,542
It's just a matter of principle.

378
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,667
Look at the atmosphere, okay?

379
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:41,250
Why can't you stop hating
and hurting each other?

380
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,458
That's not it.

381
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,167
Actually, we have a good relationship.

382
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:47,333
But we deliberately sounded hostile.

383
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,208
Do I have to explain it? It's so embarrassing.

384
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,542
Don't beat around the bush!

385
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:59,917
Oomune Bear brought the injured you here.

386
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:04,625
She's your savior.
No, she's your life-saving bear.

387
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,208
You should be grateful to her.

388
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,875
By the way, I cured your serious injury.

389
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:16,042
I'm the one who contributed the most.

390
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:19,750
Things happened for a reason.

391
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:27,542
But you should pay tribute
to those who worked hard.

392
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:34,125
Of course, that's not why
I chose this occupation.

393
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:39,125
If all can always say the words of gratitude,

394
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:44,042
I'll gladly accept your regard.

395
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:48,667
All in all, I gladly accept this wand.

396
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,292
I gladly accept it.

397
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:53,792
"GIVE ME A REWARD"
Thanks.

398
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,125
You really got the wand.

399
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,542
Of course, I deserve it.

400
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:11,667
You took it shamelessly.

401
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,333
Forget it.

402
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,500
How long will the curse last
that I'll die if I leave you?

403
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,875
Isn't there a way to dispel it?

404
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,792
Your way of expression is very infuriating.

405
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,042
Your every move makes me mad.

406
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,375
I have to be with you all the time…

407
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,458
Yes. I don't want to, though.

408
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,292
It's me who doesn't want it.

409
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:36,042
There's no other choice.

410
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:40,250
Since you saved me, I'd do you a favor.
Do you still remember it?

411
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes.

412
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,250
You saved me from serious injury.

413
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,542
I'll do you a favor.

414
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,875
Let's form a party.

415
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,250
I look forward to working with you.

416
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,167
Me... Me too.

417
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:54,958
It hurts!

418
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,542
Well, it's…

419
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,625
It's a pity that you couldn't

420
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,125
hold a girl's hand.

421
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,292
What did you say?

422
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:05,167
I spoke your mind.
Are you yelling to cover it up?

423
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,375
It's even troublesome to prove my innocence.

424
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,750
Bleh, hey.

425
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:21,042
DON'T HURT ME, MY HEALER

426
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,750
Mistur Alvin.

427
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,958
What's the matter, Misu Carla?

428
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,375
Where are we going to stay tonight?

429
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:38,292
It'll be dawn when we get to the city.

430
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,208
What should we do?

431
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,667
Miss Oomune Bear has invited you to stay.

432
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:44,583
You.

433
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:48,167
I was acting cool. How could I ask to stay?

434
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,917
It's too embarrassing to go back now.

435
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,167
Mr. Alvin.

436
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,167
What's the matter?

437
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:59,917
I feel the pain again that

438
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,167
you're really clumsy.

439
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,542
Can't you retort it?

440
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:05,958
Bingo.

441
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,833
Congratulations, you got it right.

442
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,167
You have me now.

443
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,208
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

444
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,458
"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW"
Title of the next episode.

445
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,292
"ACCIDENTALLY FELL INTO GOBLINS' TRAP AND MADE TEAMMATE A
EXHAUSTED" Alvin, who was on the journey

446
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,583
"THE CURSE HASN'T BEEN LIFTED, SO CAN'T SEPARATE FROM Carla"
with the healer Carla, wanted to collect detoxifying grass

447
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:34,125
"I THINK I'LL BE EXHAUSTED. AND SUCH A LONG TITLE CONTAINS"
for some purpose but fought with ghosts

448
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,667
"THE NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW. HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL LISTEN
TO THE END?" in the cemetery on the way. Just when

449
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,083
"CAN'T WAIT FOR EPISODE TWO""STAY TUNED"
they'll solve the crisis in an inexplicable way…
