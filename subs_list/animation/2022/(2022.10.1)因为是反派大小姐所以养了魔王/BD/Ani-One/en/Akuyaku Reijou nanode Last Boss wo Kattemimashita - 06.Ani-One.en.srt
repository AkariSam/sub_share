1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,625
This is... Demon Snuff?

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,958
He is not fully demonised yet.

3
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,542
He can still turn back to his human form.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,250
Someone's coming! Run!

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,375
You let a demon go.

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,250
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,042
You are really a girl.

8
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:38,125
Who are you?

9
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,458
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

10
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,083
THE VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER DOESN'T ALLOW EVIL DEEDS

11
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,833
The church's investigative ability
is nothing much.

12
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,875
I know who you and Senior Kyle are.

13
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,292
What?

14
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,333
Mirchetta's cleaners,

15
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,958
"Nameless Priests".

16
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,250
You are raised secretly by the church

17
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,250
while strengthening with Demon Snuff.

18
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:40,125
You infiltrated the academy
with the church's help to hunt demons.

19
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,750
Perhaps there's a possibility
that someone is using Demon Snuff here.

20
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,583
I'm going to ask you again.

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,750
Who are you?

22
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,667
Don't worry.

23
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,583
I won't tell anyone your identities.

24
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:56,417
In return, can you help me
keep a secret as well?

25
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,125
Fine.

26
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:04,000
I doubt I'll benefit
from exposing the fact that you are a girl.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,167
I'm glad that we've reached an agreement.

28
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:09,125
What are we going to do with the teacher?

29
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,375
I'll think of something later.

30
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,750
Anyway, his witness testimony...

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,625
It'll probably be something vague.

32
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,417
Senior, do you want to
investigate this thoroughly?

33
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:23,250
Perhaps you might find something.
Demon Snuff, for example.

34
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,875
Forget it. They probably did it on purpose.

35
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,375
Let's go back.

36
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,458
Aili.

37
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,000
Seems like Aili is a part of your real name.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,958
I'm not going to tell you that.

39
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,292
That's cold of you.

40
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,583
We do share each other's secrets after all.

41
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:54,000
I was just trying to help my friend
who was beaten up by my fiance.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,750
Is your friend a victim of the vampire incident?

43
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,667
Be clear about it.

44
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,083
Rachel.

45
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,208
Can you tell us slowly?

46
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:12,333
My friend's fiance is addicted
to a strange kind of incense.

47
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,083
I told Selena as well.

48
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,000
Incense? Does she mean Demon Snuff?

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,792
When I was in a dilemma,
Professor Koenig came to help me.

50
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:27,583
He said he wanted to teach me and my friend
how to terminate the engagement.

51
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,292
That was why you introduced your friend
to the professor, right?

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,250
I didn't expect something like that to happen.

53
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,042
Later, the professor asked you to go out, right?

54
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,083
Yes.

55
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,792
Although I'm afraid of him blackmailing me,

56
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,958
I still hope for things to improve.

57
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,958
Seems like you had been
the professor's target since the beginning.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,083
The professor wouldn't have come to you
if he was targeting the victim.

59
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,042
Is that so?

60
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:03,167
No matter what,
the professor has to pay for what he did.

61
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,542
He likes gambling.

62
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:08,750
Apparently, he's saddled himself
with monstrous debt.

63
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,625
He's also addicted to a type of weird incense.

64
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,167
That makes things easy.

65
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:17,833
Ruining the professor
while keeping the whole incident a secret.

66
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,417
I don't want to be his enemy indeed.

67
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,708
It's done.

68
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,792
It's so scary
to have such an excellent subordinate.

69
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,042
How did you do it?

70
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:38,208
I invited him to a poker game

71
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,750
and got him to talk about Rachel.

72
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,708
Then, I made him lose.

73
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,708
I remember he is very good at poker.

74
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,333
I'm good at cheating.

75
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,458
A debt letter?

76
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,042
The sum on this...

77
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:57,083
With this in our hands,
he'll have to listen to anything we say.

78
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,042
What about Demon Snuff?
Did he say anything about that?

79
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:03,000
I think he used a pipe
he picked up coincidentally.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,250
He didn't know much about it.

81
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,000
What a useless professor.

82
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,875
Next, we need to
make this incident into an accident.

83
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,292
Prove the victim's innocence

84
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,542
and terminate
Rachel's engagement with his fiance.

85
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,000
There are many things to be considered.

86
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,125
Let's start now.

87
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,583
All right, Rachel?

88
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,792
Anyway, I'll get the professor's matter settled.

89
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,250
Are you not sure whether to trust him or not?

90
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,917
That's not it.

91
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,458
You only trusted the wrong person.

92
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,958
Remember this.

93
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,125
A man might have hurt you

94
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,000
but a man also helped you.

95
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,667
I want to become a special existence.

96
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,833
A cool girl who helps other girls like Selena.

97
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,750
I will terminate the engagement myself.

98
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,708
I won't be able to change anything
if I keep acting weak.

99
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,792
That's great.

100
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:15,875
I don't want to live
while being fearful of others' moods.

101
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:20,208
So, can you let me join the guard unit?

102
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,292
Of course.

103
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,083
I look forward to working with you, Rachel.

104
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,667
Yes, Master Aili.

105
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,917
Nice working with you.

106
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,750
Are you going to join as well?

107
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,292
We know each other's secret, right?

108
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,500
Let's get working then.

109
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,167
Get President James' approval to use
this empty classroom as the guard unit's office.

110
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,792
That's easy.

111
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:47,250
I'll clean the office.

112
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,042
I'm going to borrow some cleaning tools.

113
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:55,958
How do we
report the vampire incident to President James?

114
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,625
Report the truth.

115
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:02,542
I'll put in a remark to not make it public
for the students' benefit.

116
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:03,833
That's surprising.

117
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,167
I thought the young lady full of justice

118
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,083
will try to expose
every evil deed to the public.

119
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,667
An underling is nothing important.

120
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:15,750
Besides, the true culprit is someone else.

121
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,083
I'm going to find James then.

122
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,542
All right!

123
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,042
Darn it! That was the last one!

124
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:36,042
A victory in the battle!

125
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,375
It's such a relief to be in the
Otome game with Pork Cutlet Sandwich.

126
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,000
Look at this.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,542
To Master Auguste.

128
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,042
Who wrote this?

129
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,542
-You appeared in my dreams.
-That letter...

130
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,125
I'm from the guard unit!
Get away from the notice board immediately!

131
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,167
What?

132
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,375
We are just looking at something
posted on the board. Is there a problem?

133
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,083
You are quite arrogant.

134
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,958
It's one against three. This is difficult.

135
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,542
Why are you making a fuss?

136
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,500
Senior Kyle.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's ungentlemanly
to outnumber someone in an argument.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,833
-Let's go.
-Sure. Darn it.

139
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,083
Senior Kyle. Thank you.

140
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,708
You are so gentle.

141
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,292
Gentle? Don't be mistaken.

142
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,125
A gentle person won't do this.

143
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,208
I think ripping up the letter
is the right thing to do though.

144
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,458
What?

145
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,292
This is definitely the Kyle route.

146
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,333
"SELENA, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LETTER"
Selena even return

147
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,625
"I COLLECTED THE PIECES AND RESTORED IT"
the letter to her friend

148
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,958
"PLEASE TAKE IT"
in the game.

149
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,417
It's cruel to return it to the sender.

150
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,917
You are a weird one.

151
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,333
Why are you following me?
I don't want anything to do with you.

152
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,875
I also want to see the cats behind the academy.

153
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,875
I can see the cat food
sticking out of your pocket.

154
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,000
That's...

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Found you. Aili...

156
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,625
What? Kyle is here as well?

157
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,083
What happened?

158
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,667
Ashtart has released a statement.

159
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,125
What is the content?

160
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:35,583
"To the human fools who are not willing
to hand over the Holy Sword Maiden's head."

161
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,708
"Misha Academy is next."

162
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,917
"I'll make it rain blood during
the school festival. Regret your actions."

163
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,667
What will the academy do in response?

164
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,458
The principal is still sick.

165
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,708
The one who replaces him...

166
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,792
The principal's proxy will
come to make regular visits.

167
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,625
The principal's proxy is...

168
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,000
Master Claude?

169
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:01,750
WALT LIZANIS
CV TOSHIYUKI TOYONAGA

170
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,750
A CHARACTER THAT CAN BE KEPT IN
"REGALIA OF SAINTS, DEMONS AND MAIDENS 2".

171
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,625
A HANDSOME CHARACTER WHO IS GOOD AT SOCIALISING.
THE ACCOUNTANT OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

172
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,625
POPULAR AND GENTLE TO GIRLS.
HOWEVER, THIS IS JUST A FACADE.

173
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,667
HE IS ACTUALLY A PERSON WITH SECRETS.

174
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,667
The school festival is an important event
at Misha Academy.

175
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,917
There are two major events.

176
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,417
On the first day,
there's the swordsmanship contest.

177
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,667
In the video game, there's an event
where the church that organised the games

178
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,917
mixes Demon Snuff in the prizes

179
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:22,708
and turns James into a demon.

180
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,708
By overcoming this event,

181
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,458
the duchy of Mirchetta will avoid destruction

182
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,000
and the Bad End can be avoided.

183
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,125
Another major event

184
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:38,083
is the ball on the second day
where "Princess Lily White" will be chosen.

185
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,208
It's a pageant contest, in short.

186
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,875
The students are already looking
for a suitable partner for the ball.

187
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,792
You won't dance with me?

188
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,000
How can you be so arrogant
when you are just a commoner?

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,375
But...

190
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,792
Well, just calm down.

191
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,583
Both of you are quite suitable for each other.

192
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,583
You have yet to decide
who you want to dance with, right?

193
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,458
But I have someone I would like to invite.

194
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,708
Auguste will be busy during the school festival
so he might not participate in the ball.

195
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,167
Seriously.

196
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,917
She wanted to invite Master Auguste?

197
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,333
She's aiming too high.

198
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,875
I invited you
because you are ugly and pitiful...

199
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,792
That's the wrong way to ask a lady. Try again.

200
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,833
A duck? Who are you?

201
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,417
I'm just a nameless ordinary duck.

202
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,375
This voice... It's Aili Kahlua, right?

203
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,542
Keep your nonsense in check.

204
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:44,958
I only kicked a guy away
who ran his mouth while looking for a partner.

205
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,333
I think doing that is better than
posting a friend's letter on the notice board.

206
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,583
What are you saying?

207
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:57,583
I saw you accepting the girl's letter.

208
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:02,708
Are you trying to say that I did that?
I don't think anyone will believe you.

209
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,875
It's all right. I'm only confirming the facts.

210
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:08,250
Demon King!

211
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,792
Master Claude.

212
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:19,333
What a big academy
As expected of a prestigious school.

213
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,250
I was worried about their reaction
when they see the Demon King.

214
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,458
Demon King. The meeting will start soon.
We are short on time.

215
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,250
Belzebuth can read the time now!

216
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,625
No. I want to see the academy.

217
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,250
Ashtart's attack has to be avoided.

218
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,625
He won't attack the place.
No demon can win against the Demon King.

219
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,583
Bel, set your biases aside.

220
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,375
You can do it.

221
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,583
Master Claude is teaching him.

222
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,167
He was so overprotective at first.

223
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,042
Speaking of which, I have something to confirm.

224
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:00,583
Is there a duck student in this academy?

225
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,292
A duck?

226
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:03,500
President James!

227
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:08,208
Have you taken your break yet?
Let me show the principal around instead.

228
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,792
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

229
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,833
If the principal hasn't had lunch yet,

230
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,500
let me take you to the dining hall.

231
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,750
I remember
that Selena idolised the Holy Sword Maiden.

232
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,250
He is the Demon King!
Are you sure it's all right?

233
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,208
Keith and Bel, both of you may return.

234
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,667
I'll go and patrol the academy with her.

235
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,250
Well, that's fine.

236
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
Thanks for your help.

237
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
Well, you are...

238
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,250
Please call me Selena.

239
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,958
Selena, please lead the way.

240
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,125
Sure. Leave it to me.

241
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,583
Well...

242
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,542
Can I call you Master Claude?

243
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,500
Sure but please refrain from being intimate.

244
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,833
My fiancee is very jealous.

245
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,042
His face is really a weapon.

246
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,292
I want to cover it in a paper bag.

247
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,375
Due to Ashtart's statement,

248
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,750
the principal has the intention
to send some guards over.

249
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,875
Who should we send to liaise...

250
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,833
I'll go.

251
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,500
No. It should be me.

252
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,958
It's too dangerous for a girl.

253
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,917
Master Claude will protect me so it'll be fine.

254
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,583
He is the Demon King though.

255
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,250
The enemy of the Holy Sword Maiden you idolised.

256
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,875
Enough! He's still human.

257
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,000
You are right.

258
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:33,833
Besides, the Holy Sword Maiden
probably wants to save the Demon King too.

259
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,500
So, I want to be the person to support him.

260
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,917
This girl...

261
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:42,167
It's still too dangerous for a girl
even if it's just as a liaison.

262
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,417
What if you offend
the daughter of the Dautriche family?

263
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,583
Exactly. She is the principal's fiancee...

264
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,958
That's exactly what I want.

265
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,417
Apparently, she has an unforgiving personality.

266
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,250
She might come rushing here.

267
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,750
The rumours say she is a young lady
who has no knowledge at all.

268
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,542
Since the Demon King didn't bring her here,

269
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,042
she might really be a problematic one.

270
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,917
You'll all regret this moment in the future.

271
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh. I think we've received a portrait of her.

272
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:13,958
A portrait?

273
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes. This is it.

274
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:17,625
To be honest, I can't accept it.

275
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,375
I'm impressed at the Demon King's taste

276
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,250
but I don't look forward to learning from him.

277
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,750
I think he has strange taste
because he is the Demon King.

278
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,750
I don't know who spread this portrait around
but this person probably has a death wish.

279
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,875
Their engagement must have been decided
by the Dautriche family.

280
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,667
That is why I want to invite Master Claude
to the school festival.

281
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,333
I want to be chosen as Princess White Lily
and be invited as Master Claude's partner.

282
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,458
It's almost time for me to live.
After all, I need to go on patrol.

283
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:50,917
I'll go with you today.

284
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:51,917
Me too.

285
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,292
Me too.

286
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,458
I'll go as well then.

287
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,958
Why are all of you following me?

288
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,208
Because that topic is a bit...

289
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,375
I'm not good with that as well.

290
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,083
Who's going to be the liaison?

291
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,958
We'll just have to let her do it.

292
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,250
After all, the Demon King chose Selena.

293
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,208
Is that so?

294
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,250
Master Claude chose her?

295
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,958
What's going on? Is he having an affair?

296
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,750
I think it's our first time
walking together like this.

297
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,917
I think so.

298
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:31,375
Guys like to gather and chat sometimes.

299
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:35,708
It'll be better for the student council
if we show a bit of unity.

300
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,625
As expected of Aili. You just know what to say.

301
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,375
Let's improve our relationship from now on.

302
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,417
I refuse.

303
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,333
It's good enough to carry out our own tasks.

304
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,750
I don't like people getting in my way.

305
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,333
Why is everyone so cold?

306
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,292
It's really hard for them
to improve their relationship.

307
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:58,250
After all, Walt and Kyle are
assassins sent here to assassinate James.

308
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,958
Auguste is the character
who defeats James in the end.

309
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,000
If it goes according to the game,

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,292
these four people
are rivals who try to kill each other.

311
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:10,292
They must never learn James' true identity.

312
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,500
There's a sweet smell.

313
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,417
James!

314
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,833
Let me be...

315
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,625
Oh no!

316
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,917
Auguste, take President James
to rest in the dorm!

317
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:30,167
Sure! James, let's go.

318
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:33,042
It's all right. I can walk... On my own.

319
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,917
Stop saying nonsense. Your face is pale.

320
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:39,042
Aili Kahlua, report this to the teacher.

321
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,333
Me? But...

322
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,292
Kyle, it's fine.

323
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,250
What?

324
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,875
Aili knows our true identity.

325
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,333
He might be from another organisation
but he is one of our own.

326
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,292
What?

327
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,500
But he is so weak.

328
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,042
That's because Aili is...

329
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,542
Hurry up and look for Demon Snuff.

330
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,375
It'll be troublesome if the demons are here.

331
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,125
Found it!

332
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,458
This is it, right?

333
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,292
It's empty. It has a faint smell.

334
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,792
It doesn't feel like
it is used to attract demons.

335
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,167
Who put it here and for what reason then?

336
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,292
It's not the church
that spreads the Demon Snuff, right?

337
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:28,917
The church spreads it and
wants us to retrieve it? That's impossible.

338
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:33,792
However, I have news that
the church is planning to mix Demon Snuff

339
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:37,625
into the swordsmanship contest prizes
to lure out the demons.

340
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,917
Stop joking!

341
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,458
The church won't do something like that!

342
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,000
It's possible if they were paid though.

343
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,625
Those old sly priest foxes.

344
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,917
Walt!

345
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:51,667
Our mission's client is the Mirchetta family.

346
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:55,292
The mission content also
stems from their own family problems.

347
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:59,542
You actually revealed the secret of our mission
in front of Aili?

348
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,500
Aili knows everything after all.

349
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,458
I guess.

350
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,833
From the game.

351
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,083
What is Demon Snuff?

352
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,208
Sorry. James say he was fine so...

353
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:22,958
Aili and the both of you are from
a secret organisation sent by the Elmir Empire?

354
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,208
Incredible!

355
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:29,917
That's right. Senior Walt and
Senior Kyle are just apprentices.

356
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,875
Aili... Are you our superior?

357
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,125
Right?

358
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,875
-Yes.
-That's right.

359
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,042
You have more subordinates now.

360
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,792
The Demon Snuff you speak of.
Does it make people violent?

361
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,667
Yes.

362
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,667
Is that why there have been more incidents
where female students are being bullied?

363
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:53,167
Now that he mentions it, I think so.
I thought it was just a norm here.

364
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,875
We can't turn a blind eye
since Demon Snuff appears in the academy.

365
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,625
I will help too.

366
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,792
Thanks for your help.

367
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,542
James. You will help as well, right?

368
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:07,042
Help these people who still
seem to have something to hide?

369
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:14,333
Demon stuff is harmful to humans
but is that all?

370
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,458
I will report this to the principal.

371
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:24,125
They have a mission to carry out.

372
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,042
It's normal for them to not reveal everything.

373
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,417
Let's just believe them.

374
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,917
Auguste, I envy your naivety.

375
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,667
I won't believe in anyone.

376
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,292
I'll go persuade him.

377
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,167
President James!

378
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,875
Wait! I have something to say to you.

379
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:49,625
Is that so? Actually, I have a question for you.

380
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,083
Who are you?

381
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,667
I've already said it just now...

382
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,542
Let me change my question.

383
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:02,958
You saw my true form, didn't you?
