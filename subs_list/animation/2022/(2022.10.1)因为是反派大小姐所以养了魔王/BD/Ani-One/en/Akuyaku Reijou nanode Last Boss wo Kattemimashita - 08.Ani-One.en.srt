1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:04,708
The prize for winning the title
of Princess Lily White is Demon Snuff?

2
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:10,333
How dare she bully my cute junior.

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,375
Rachel, can you lend me the dress?

4
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,958
Good evening, gentlemen.

5
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:59,458
I'M THE VILLAINESS,
SO I'M TAMING THE FINAL BOSS!

6
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,333
THE VILLAINESS' MISDEEDS ARE EXPOSED

7
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,917
Does the school have such a beautiful girl?

8
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:12,708
-How pretty.
-So beautiful.

9
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,583
This might be a prestigious school,
but it is still a school game.

10
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:20,875
It's nothing much for someone like me
who is used to social events.

11
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:25,625
Judges, I leave myself
in your capable hands this evening.

12
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,833
What a graceful form.

13
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,208
Thank you, Lady Reuss.

14
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:38,667
I've learned a lot from the book you authored,
"The Rules and Radiance of Gentlewomen".

15
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,708
You've read my book? I'm so happy.

16
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,500
Everyone from the student council. Good evening.

17
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,125
What a lovely night.

18
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,708
Am I dreaming?

19
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,083
It hurts.

20
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,292
What do I do? My heart is racing.

21
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,708
Even me...

22
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,250
He's even prettier than I imagined.

23
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
Is there anything you needed from me?

24
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,500
Isn't there a dance assessment later?

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,208
Would you dance with me?

26
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,500
How can you get a head start?

27
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,000
My eyes... Something's wrong with them.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,250
Should I get them examined?

29
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:27,042
Lovely lady.

30
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,417
Please honour me with a dance.

31
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,958
As expected of the final boss of the sequel.

32
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,208
That's a pass.

33
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,042
Have you heard?

34
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,375
Lady Selena was pushed down the stairs.

35
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,500
It was her, right?

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Do you want some juice?

37
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,708
Thank you.

38
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,083
I didn't get to invite a girl
who attended a banquet alone in the past.

39
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,667
I wanted to greet her

40
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,292
but I couldn't move when the time came.

41
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm such a coward.

42
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,542
That's not true.

43
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,875
You did well.

44
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,292
You helped me when I needed it most.

45
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,083
So, please hold your head high.

46
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,917
You need to be a different kind of girl

47
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:56,417
compared to her.

48
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,708
Thank you. I feel much better.

49
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,250
What have I done?

50
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,917
Isn't this Rachel?

51
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,333
Lady Selena.

52
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,583
What a pity. You couldn't participate
in the Princess Lily White contest.

53
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,750
I think you would do well
if you had participated in it.

54
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,583
She is here to see how frustrated I am

55
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,458
because she is basking herself
in the feeling that she's won against me.

56
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,542
However, she will probably win the contest.

57
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,500
Although I don't know who she is,

58
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:39,917
I don't think I'm really suitable to be
Princess Lily White after thinking about it.

59
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,542
It's frustrating to lose to other people, right?

60
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:48,083
I would've run away if I were you, Lady Selena.

61
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,833
I'm glad that you understand.

62
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,500
This year's Princess Lily White.

63
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,750
Entry number seven!

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,292
This is the prize
for this year's Princess Lily White.

65
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,958
Finally, Princess Lily White
will grace us with her dance...

66
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,708
If you'll excuse me...

67
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,500
Princess Lily White!

68
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,333
An item from the East.

69
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,417
An incense burner.

70
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,625
Inside it is...

71
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,333
It's empty.

72
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,792
Seems like the anonymous letter
sent to the capital was just a prank.

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,167
It feels like we are being toyed with.

74
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,208
Something terrible is going on in the hall...

75
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,208
Everyone. Please listen to me.

76
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,125
Ashtart is hiding in this academy.

77
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,417
Ashtart?

78
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,667
That's...

79
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,875
It's a demon
that we've been hearing about recently.

80
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,083
That's...

81
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,792
Demon Snuff!

82
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,125
I will unmask Ashtart

83
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,875
and pass my judgement on it!

84
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,917
Demon, show yourself!

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,250
Run! The smoke is poisonous!

86
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,625
Don't inhale the smoke! Run!

87
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,250
President James!

88
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,667
James?

89
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,250
So it was you, President James.

90
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,542
James, you...

91
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:10,000
Auguste! Hurry! Defeat him with the holy sword!

92
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,958
James.

93
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,208
Turns out it was you.

94
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,542
Stop!

95
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,625
We have to kill the demon

96
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,750
even if it used to be our friend.

97
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,875
The church did send
demon-hunting assassins into the academy.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,375
President James, stop!

99
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,625
Come back to your senses, James!

100
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,833
Let go!

101
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,000
Let go. I'm already...

102
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,500
I told you I would protect you.

103
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,750
Believe in me!

104
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:21,792
I won't allow a demon
to be killed in the academy.

105
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:25,083
If you have no place you belong to,
just stay by my side.

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,250
Believe in me and accept me!

107
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,792
James!

108
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,750
I have a place I belong to as well?

109
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,208
The demon is still alive.

110
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,958
Auguste, kill him with the holy sword!

111
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,667
Selena, what are you talking about?

112
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:00,167
I heard the holy sword...

113
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,500
Is in your hands...

114
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,500
Answer me. Why do you have the Demon Snuff?

115
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,292
Demon Snuff? What's that?

116
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,417
He's the one at fault.

117
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:16,292
No. You are the one at fault!

118
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,083
James did nothing

119
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,542
but you turned him into a demon.

120
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:28,375
All of you won't be a demon's ally, right?

121
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,125
We don't remember becoming your allies.

122
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,542
Besides, James is human now.

123
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:39,833
Our instructions are not to kill humans.

124
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,167
What? That's weird.

125
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,417
I only followed the letter...

126
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,083
Look...

127
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,125
It's a horde of demons.

128
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,333
They are attracted by the Demon Snuff.

129
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,792
Run!

130
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,333
I will think of something.

131
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:05,583
Aili.

132
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,875
What are you talking about?

133
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,083
Sorry for the late introduction.

134
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,583
My name is

135
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,958
Aileen Lauren Dautriche,

136
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,375
the Holy Sword Maiden.

137
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,750
Holy Sword, you mustn't kill the demons.

138
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,542
Don't kill the demons but save the humans.

139
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:39,417
That's right.
I'm going to be the Demon King's wife.

140
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,375
What are you doing?

141
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,958
Master Claude...

142
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,500
My dear Aileen.

143
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,042
You should be in the capital.

144
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:08,875
AUGUSTE ZELM

145
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,875
MAIN CHARACTER IN
"REGALIA OF SAINTS, DEMONS AND MAIDENS 2"

146
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,875
VICE PRESIDENT OF
MISHA ACADEMY'S STUDENT COUNCIL

147
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,917
IN THE AUGUSTE ROUTE,
HE BORROWED THE HOLY SWORD FROM LILIA

148
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:12,875
AND DEFEATED JAMES,
THE FINAL BOSS WHO TURNED INTO A DEMON.

149
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:23,000
The Demon Snuff chaos ended
thanks to Master Claude.

150
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,500
However, Master Claude saw me,
yet he didn't approach me.

151
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,042
Seemed like he was really angry.

152
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,667
The person in the duck costume...

153
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,042
Is actually the Demon King's fiancee...

154
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,500
And also the Holy Sword Maiden...

155
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,333
It's incredible.

156
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,583
I did many rude things...

157
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:52,917
Whether you are a man or a woman, I don't...

158
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:57,000
Excuse me.
Why are you bringing the duck costume?

159
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:02,708
I thought the duck
might distract Master Claude from his anger.

160
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,208
The Demon King closes his heart.

161
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,958
It's over!

162
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,958
Nice timing.

163
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,417
I've been feeling lonely
since it's so empty inside.

164
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,167
Empty... Are you talking about the prison?

165
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:40,125
Lady Aileen.
This is the greatest prison in the world.

166
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,500
Go in. I'm sure it looks good with you inside.

167
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,708
Master Claude, I'm not a criminal!

168
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,667
Aileen, you are important to me.

169
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:56,167
I have been spoiling you but this won't do.

170
00:13:56,167 --> 00:14:01,042
I didn't expect you to dress as a boy
and sneaked into the academy.

171
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,833
I finally know
why the duck has been concerning me.

172
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,167
I'm relieved now.

173
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:12,167
Finally, I can see your crying face.

174
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,667
I... only did the right thing

175
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,333
as the woman who'll become your wife.

176
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,792
You know about the Demon Snuff, right?

177
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:29,583
What if it had affected you?

178
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,708
Do you want me to suffer what I went through
when Master Cedric set you up?

179
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,250
Do you expect me to sit in the capital
and wait while doing nothing?

180
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:45,208
Demon King. Aileen worried about you.

181
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,250
That was why I couldn't tell you.

182
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,958
Sorry.

183
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,958
She isn't someone obedient.

184
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,667
You knew that, don't you?

185
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:59,833
Since you are his fiance, you should
just use a rope and tie her by your side.

186
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,625
That's true. You are right.

187
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,375
I'll have to punish you later.

188
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,708
Well,

189
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,208
you seemed to have increased the number of pets.

190
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,542
Master Claude.

191
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:29,125
I think James is a talent
you need to build this new era.

192
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:34,250
Is this what you meant when you said
I have a place I belong?

193
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,792
James. Are you all right?

194
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:41,583
Well, congratulations on finding a new job.

195
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:45,208
Are you kidding me? I haven't agreed to it!

196
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:50,083
Auguste, are you willing to become my knight?

197
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,833
I've been looking for a knight like you.

198
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:59,458
Rachel, are you willing to be my aide?

199
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,583
Me?

200
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:05,542
I've been looking for an aide
who will fight alongside me.

201
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,583
Also...

202
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,875
We are people from the church.

203
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,125
I'll just make arrangements
with the church then.

204
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:18,333
I have the dirt on the church
during the swordsmanship contest.

205
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,125
I'm sure the church will sell you to me.

206
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,708
We...

207
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,333
Got sold to the Demon King.

208
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,875
What's remaining is Selena who escaped.

209
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,417
She has already been captured.

210
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,542
What is the reason for that?

211
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:39,917
Demon Snuff. She smells of Demon Snuff.

212
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,250
So, I've been cautious around her.

213
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,750
I just didn't show it to her.

214
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,500
Selena didn't know what Demon Snuff is
yet she had been bringing it with her.

215
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,667
Demon Snuff? What's that?

216
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:04,083
Auguste being the Holy Knight
is also a part of the game's plot.

217
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,667
I heard the holy sword...

218
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:09,917
Is in your hands...

219
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:16,125
That means she only followed the instructions
of someone who knows about the game.

220
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,208
What? That's weird.

221
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,042
I only followed the letter...

222
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,375
Letter.

223
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,458
The person who would send her a letter...

224
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,625
That person is...

225
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,500
Sorry. She idolises the Holy Sword Maiden.

226
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,042
She even communicates with Miss Lilia
through letters.

227
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,917
I know.

228
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,292
The culprit behind this incident...

229
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:46,583
Ashtart's identity is...

230
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,583
Lady Aileen.

231
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,667
You've returned from Mirchetta already.

232
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,083
Were you testing me?

233
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,583
Testing to see if I have knowledge of the game.

234
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,625
To see if I'm the same as you,
having memories from my past life.

235
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,333
When did you regain your memory?

236
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,125
Well...

237
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:41,000
Since Lady Aileen met Master Cedric.

238
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,333
What if someone died in this incident?

239
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,667
Died? What are you talking about?

240
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,458
They are just characters in a game.

241
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:58,083
Lady Aileen, were you the type who couldn't
tell games from reality in your previous life?

242
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,000
This is the game's world.

243
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,833
Who would stop playing a game
because they cared about the characters' lives?

244
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,167
This is reality.

245
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,500
Everyone is the same as you.

246
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,208
They are humans who won't come back if they die.

247
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,917
I am a player,

248
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:23,125
so you can enjoy
being the protagonist of the story.

249
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:27,250
Everyone else's parts ended
after they said the lines in their script.

250
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,917
That is why I chose you as my opponent.

251
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,583
Let's have some more fun.

252
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,167
Lady Aileen.

253
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:40,083
Sorry. I'm not going to play with you.

254
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,833
Are you going to turn yourself in this time?

255
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,333
Did I do anything?

256
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,417
If you have evidence, show me.

257
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:52,167
Do you think you've won?

258
00:19:55,792 --> 00:20:00,292
You are the one who can't
separate reality from the game.

259
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:03,500
If you want to play with me,
go back and try again.

260
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,250
Lady Lilia. Good day to you.

261
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,917
Ashtart announced the end of the rebellion.

262
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:33,417
Peace has also returned to Misha Academy.

263
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:40,333
The Duchy of Mirchetta
expressed its gratitude towards Master Claude

264
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:45,125
and gave all the students
who stopped the demon attack to Master Claude.

265
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:52,583
Master Claude expressed his desire to create
a world that protects demons and humans.

266
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,583
It's a big step towards
improving the relationship between both sides.

267
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,333
Master Claude, let's go.

268
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,042
Speaking of which, Aileen.

269
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:11,667
I've been busy with work
and didn't have time to punish you.

270
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,125
Well...

271
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,667
How about a kiss

272
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,708
as your punishment?

273
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:23,792
Let's talk later regarding this.

274
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,667
How could you do that here...

275
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,583
You've not been prioritising me.

276
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:41,042
You just need to look at me.

277
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,167
This person

278
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,208
really doesn't fight fair.

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,875
Let's go.

280
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,833
The emperor is waiting for us.

281
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,375
We will keep moving forward

282
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,750
toward the happy future

283
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,042
that belongs to both of us.

284
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:08,667
Regardless of how tough this journey will be.
