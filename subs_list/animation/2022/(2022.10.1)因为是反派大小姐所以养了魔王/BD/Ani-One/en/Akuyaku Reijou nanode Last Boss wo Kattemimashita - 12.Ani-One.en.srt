1
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:04,750
Let me out of here! Please!

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,125
Silence, Elephas!

3
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,292
Many women and children
are being held hostage in the royal capital.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,583
Are you all going to sacrifice them?

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:16,083
How dare you say that after you begged
the empress dowager and betrayed your tribe?

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:19,667
We will control the Demon King on your behalf
and attack the capital.

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,125
What plans do you have for the future?

8
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,667
Miss Aileen.

9
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:31,458
So, this incident was caused
because a coup d'etat was planned.

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:35,000
If it's not stopped immediately,
the Levi clan will be wiped out.

11
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:40,625
In the end, it is just as Lilia said,
the future will not change.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,125
Miss Lilia?

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,375
You're indeed with Lilia...

14
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:50,500
No. To be specific, I work for Empress Dowager.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,042
It's just that I'm...

16
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,667
with Lilia one-sided...

17
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:58,125
What's wrong?
Why are you looking at me like dirt?

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,667
Nothing. Please go on.

19
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,500
About half a year ago,
I had my first conversation with Miss Lilia.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,750
Forget it.

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,875
She must have told you

22
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:12,375
"You worked so hard but it doesn't seem
to be working out. What a pity."

23
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,625
Your heart skipped a beat then.

24
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,083
How innocent.

25
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:21,083
Could you please not ruin my beautiful memories.

26
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:26,333
Then, she must have told you
the Levi's would head towards an end, right?

27
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,917
That's right.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,042
I see.

29
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:35,250
She had also gotten back
the power of the Scared Sword.

30
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,958
I borrowed the Sacred Sword from her...

31
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:43,750
All of those were my work.

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,333
She had me there.

33
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,167
I did not expect her to take down Elephas first

34
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,583
and took actions
that are the complete opposites of the game.

35
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,000
I have no more magic now to escape from prison.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why don't you have magic?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,042
You took my magic away with the Sacred Sword.

38
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,000
I happen to land in my homeland.

39
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:10,125
Is that so?
The Sacred Sword took away your magic?

40
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,000
No wonder I'm feeling energetic.

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,792
It seems like
I have the ability to save your people.

42
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:35,875
Do you have anything you want to say?

43
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,042
But I...

44
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,458
Stop pretending in front of me.

45
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,833
I will never forgive you
for what you did to Almond.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,333
Beg me for mercy.

47
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,083
Kneel and ask for my forgiveness.

48
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,250
This way... I can...

49
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,583
face Almond...

50
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you doing?

51
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,208
Demon...

52
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,417
The eye of a mage is a powerful magical tool.

53
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,375
With this left eye,

54
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,333
you can undo the spell cast on the Demon King.

55
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,167
This is as much as I can do now...

56
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,250
to show you my loyalty.

57
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:39,458
Is it all right for me to help him, Almond?

58
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,833
Contain this place and head to the capital.

59
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,958
Bring that crystal along.

60
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,583
I'M THE VILLAINESS, SO I'M TAMING THE FINAL BOSS!

61
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:22,958
THE VILLAINESS CAN ALSO BECOME
THE PROTAGONIST WITH LOVE

62
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,583
-Stop.
-Don't run.

63
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,750
Arrest them!

64
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,417
Over here.

65
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,417
Selena.

66
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,583
If you want to be saved, follow me.

67
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,875
I know where the Demon King is.

68
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,625
Why are you helping us?

69
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,625
If I help all of you, Lilia will...

70
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,917
All of you hate that woman, right?

71
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,375
It's that simple.

72
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,000
Speaking of which,

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,250
what does the Empress Dowager want to do
by capturing mages as hostages?

74
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,208
Don't you find it strange?

75
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,333
The Empress Dowager's
youthful look is suspicious.

76
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,625
Could it be...

77
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,000
That's a waste of the mages' powers.

78
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,583
Isaac! Keith!

79
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,125
Miss Aileen.

80
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,333
Why is the mage following you?

81
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,583
He is an enemy, right?

82
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,875
It's fine. I've handled it.

83
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,750
The way you put it sounds...

84
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,667
What happened on your side?

85
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,500
Aren't the demons staying away from the capital?

86
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,083
They are returning to the capital
to save the Demon King.

87
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,083
Elephas, help me.

88
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,000
You should have some magic back, right?

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,708
Wait. Miss Aileen!

90
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,250
Aileen. Move out. The Demon King let out a cry.

91
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,458
Calm down, all of you.

92
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,083
Master Claude would never summon you.

93
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,333
Are you saying we shouldn't save the Demon King?

94
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,083
Do you care more about the humans
than the Demon King?

95
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,167
I will save Master Claude.

96
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:30,042
Belzebuth. You will protect the demons.

97
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,125
Only until sunset.

98
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,042
Any longer, I will not wait.

99
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,667
I can take one person to the capital.

100
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,500
But the problem comes after that.

101
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,833
What do you mean?

102
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,792
To get Master Claude back to normal,

103
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:52,375
this crystal has to be placed
in the Empress Dowager's magic item.

104
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,917
But, I don't know where the magic item is.

105
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,375
Aileen. Can you hear me?

106
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,583
Aileen!

107
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,958
This voice is...

108
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,375
James! I hear you!

109
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,000
Where are you now?

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,833
I'm in the capital.

111
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,750
We found Master Claude

112
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,000
but he's heavily drugged with Demon Snuff
and won't wake up.

113
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,042
-We've been surrounded.
-Open the door.

114
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,083
Is Rachel all right?

115
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,458
She's fine. She's working harder than anyone.

116
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:25,042
Anyway, the Demon King's cry
was caused by the Demon Snuff.

117
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:29,417
The Demon King can blow off the Demon Snuff
as long as His Highness regains his powers

118
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,292
but we don't know how to do that.

119
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,917
Selena. Can you hear me?

120
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:38,875
Do you know about
the Empress Dowager's magic item?

121
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,042
Magic item?

122
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:43,667
Don't you want to get Master Cedric?

123
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,250
You should have checked the palace, right?

124
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,125
Even so, do you think I will tell you?

125
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,875
I hate Lilia the most, and you're second to her.

126
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,625
Selena.

127
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,917
Please. We need your strength.

128
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,208
It is most likely to be in the North Tower.

129
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,583
I heard that the important treasures are there.

130
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,833
It makes sense.
Even Holy Knights are not allowed there.

131
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,417
Both of you are indeed a good match.

132
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,250
Auguste. Continue to be fooled by Selena.

133
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,708
-What do you mean?
-What are you saying?

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,917
Aileen.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,417
We will protect Master Claude.

136
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,542
So, you have to be safe too.

137
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,583
Otherwise, Master Claude would be sad.

138
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:33,250
Don't worry. I won't make him sad.

139
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,000
Over here.

140
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:50,000
Are the hostages of the Levi tribe
at the North Tower too?

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,958
Yes.

142
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,542
Sacred Sword? Could it be...

143
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,875
LILIA RAINWORTH
CV KANA HANAZAWA

144
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,958
REINCARNATION OF THE HOLY SWORD MAIDEN
FROM A COMMONER TO BARON'S DAUGHTER

145
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,792
AN INFLUENTIAL PERSON IN THE ACADEMY

146
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,667
EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ABILITIES. BECOMING THE
HOLY SWORD MAIDEN ACCORDING TO VARIOUS ROUTES

147
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,875
HAS MEMORIES OF THE GAME JUST LIKE AILEEN.
GOOD AT CONTROLLING CHARACTERS WITH WORDS

148
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,000
Elephas should be sentenced to death.

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,167
I really like the pathetic storyline
and even adjusted the affection levels.

150
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,833
Don't mind it.
It's not something characters would understand.

151
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,750
Isn't that right, Miss Aileen?

152
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,000
How's the content this time?

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,292
I've reflected and worked very hard
on my previous attempt.

154
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:43,125
I think you're putting effort
in the wrong direction.

155
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:48,042
Is that so? It's very hard to obtain
the Sacred Sword on Leister's route, you know?

156
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,333
What I have with me
is the Sacred Sword from Cedric's route.

157
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,667
Lilia tamed a different character

158
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,875
and had the Sacred Sword resurrected.

159
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,042
I'll distract her.
You'll undo Master Claude's spell.

160
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,792
Let me ask you a question.

161
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,583
Why are you in my way?

162
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:16,125
It's because I'm the only one who can defeat you.

163
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:20,125
Don't lose too badly, Miss Aileen.

164
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,000
You're the protagonist.

165
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:38,083
If something happens to the Demon King,
I'll not let you go.

166
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,208
Sure. Please swallow me whole
starting from the head.

167
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,333
Honestly, I'm not a good person either.

168
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,000
My wish is for a demon to swallow me.

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
What are you saying?

170
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:54,000
Actually, I envy you all.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,792
Every time Master Claude is in pain,

172
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,708
I'm the only one who can't feel it.

173
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,875
Belzebuth!

174
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,083
I finally caught up with you.

175
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,083
Did any demon get injured?

176
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,208
We brought medication.

177
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,375
Don't get the old man worked up.

178
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,583
What are we supposed to do now?

179
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,333
Are we heading to the capital blindly
after sunset?

180
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,125
Or are we going together to save the Demon King?

181
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,792
Why do you want to save the Demon King?

182
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,625
If you like Aileen,

183
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,167
the Demon King would be an obstacle.

184
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:48,250
Even if all of you worked together,
you're no match for the Demon King.

185
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,750
Bel. Read the room.

186
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,875
Try to understand the complex heart of men,
will you?

187
00:12:56,792 --> 00:13:00,167
Why are we saving the Demon King? It's simple.

188
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,542
Humans are stupid.

189
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:07,708
With a heart, we can get along with anyone.

190
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,083
Anyone?

191
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,583
That's right. With you all too.

192
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,875
It does seem like the way of humans.

193
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,250
Arrogant and self-righteous.

194
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,237
Curse you, protagonist bonuses.

195
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:48,875
The gamers' effort is always rewarded,
that is why otome games are interesting.

196
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,750
In that case, grow your etiquette stats too.

197
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,500
However, etiquette and strength stats
are incompatible.

198
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,000
However, villainesses usually
have high basic specs, don't they?

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,958
The only bad part is your personality, then?

200
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,500
That's a wall I made out of the Sacred Sword.

201
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,250
Don't disturb our joy, all right?

202
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,000
First things first,
I'll relieve her of her sacred sword.

203
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,542
It hurts.

204
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:36,208
Seriously. It really hurts.

205
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,125
Are you trying to snatch my Scared Sword?

206
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,958
I want you to return it to me.

207
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,875
In the future, I'll be the one
to destroy the demons and the Demon King.

208
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:49,042
Enjoy this game with me.

209
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,125
Won't you be bothered to know
who the Holy Sword Maiden is?

210
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,708
Holy Sword Maiden?

211
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,250
I am the one
who will become the Demon King's wife!

212
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:10,042
What about Regalia of Saints, Demons and Maidens?

213
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,083
Whatever it is...

214
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:16,500
Of course, it's the power of love.

215
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:21,292
Are you serious?

216
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,958
You took the Demon King's power?

217
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,792
Are you trying to kill the Demon King?

218
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,625
Master Claude won't die and leave me alone.

219
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,500
Moreover...

220
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,000
I just have to save Master Claude first.

221
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,625
No.

222
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,000
The door is sealed with magic.

223
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,250
What a pity!

224
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,917
The magic is running out.

225
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,805
Master Claude is in danger.

226
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,833
With all my magic...

227
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,583
Miss Aileen.

228
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,333
I'm the winner.

229
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,417
It's about time for me to make an entrance.

230
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,417
No way...

231
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,208
Almond!

232
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,125
Save Master Claude!

233
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,333
Leave it to me!

234
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,375
What's going on?

235
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,125
I'm the best.

236
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,208
Why? Could it be...

237
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,333
We did it...

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,083
The magic must have been lifted.

239
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,250
This is the end!

240
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,167
Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

241
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,083
You should be executed for disobeying the order.

242
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:19,125
What a pity.
Aileen will end up being punished heavily.

243
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,167
Who are you pointing your swords at?

244
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,375
Master Claude...

245
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,458
Demon King!

246
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,583
Stand down.

247
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,000
But the order...

248
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,667
The order is cancelled.

249
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:02,792
The King is unwell. He needs to take some rest.

250
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,833
Hence, as the Imperial Prince,
I will take over his duties.

251
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,708
Is that right, Cedric?

252
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,917
As you said, Brother.

253
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,208
What is happening?

254
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,042
Leister.

255
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:21,208
I investigated your purchase
of the Demon Snuff at the auction.

256
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,292
Marcus used it very well.

257
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,375
What...

258
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,542
What's going on?

259
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:30,292
Lilia. You are a horrible woman.

260
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,958
Everyone is working for you

261
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,333
but you pretend as if you know nothing.

262
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,250
Brother.

263
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,000
The fault is mine for not controlling my people.

264
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,417
My fiancee is also guilty.

265
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,583
Please punish us.

266
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,292
Cedric.

267
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:54,917
Lilia. I will not listen to you
or be controlled by you anymore.

268
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:02,292
Even so, my love for you will never change.

269
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,458
Aileen.

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
You must be scared.

271
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,625
It's all right now.

272
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,375
Aileen. Come here.

273
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,167
After the King and Queen receive treatment,

274
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,583
Master Claude announced

275
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,333
"I'm getting married to Aileen."

276
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:53,625
The Levi tribe has also been pardoned
by Master Claude.

277
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:58,208
Their safety is now guaranteed.

278
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,583
Almond is still as strong as he is.

279
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,792
He's practising the dance
for the wedding ceremony.

280
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:10,833
It seems that Elephas' magic arrow
had him in a state of thanatosis.

281
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:17,333
The mage who insisted on not killing demons
is best suited as the final boss.

282
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:25,125
Master Cedric and Lilia
live happily ever after in their prison.

283
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,833
A bright future

284
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,667
that's supposed to head towards a dark end

285
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,042
is now as bright as ever.

286
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,917
It doesn't matter what the future holds.

287
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,375
Even if a bad ending was right here,

288
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,792
it cannot stop the strong love
between two people.
