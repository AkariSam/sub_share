1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:03,917
Here. This is Master Claude's hair.

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:05,208
Appreciate it.

3
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:09,875
Demon King. It's indeed Demon King's hair.

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,208
Demon King! Demon King!

5
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,667
Demon King! It's the Demon King!

6
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,792
There's a hint of Demon King's scent.

7
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,625
Don't worry. Master Claude and I...

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,333
It's too late to change anything now.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,750
You... Can you be more gentle
with the Demon King?

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,875
The priority is to maintain the marriage.

11
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,542
Love can be cultivated when things are done.

12
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:38,042
Anyway, he'll be mine
as long as he falls in love with me.

13
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,333
From a different perspective,

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,375
love like this is like standing on a cliff.

15
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,542
That's right.

16
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,167
It's to convince him to jump

17
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,875
or even push him down

18
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,167
so he'll never get up again.

19
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:20,583
I'M THE VILLAINESS, SO I'M TAMING THE FINAL BOSS

20
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,750
Master Claude is going out on an inspection?

21
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,750
"THE VILLAINESS' LOVE IS UNREQUITED"
That's right.

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,792
Demon King losing his memory and magic
is no longer a secret.

23
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,500
That is why he is going for an inspection.

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,167
The objective is to make a good impression
on the people.

25
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,208
Master Cedric and Miss Lilia will go along too.

26
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,208
They're going too?

27
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:47,125
It was Miss Lilia
who arranged the inspection this time.

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,083
If it's Miss Lilia's arrangement...

29
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,333
This is the game's world.

30
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,750
Then, she could have possibly started the game.

31
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,083
Elephas.

32
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:05,417
If you'd recover Master Claude's memories,
what would you do?

33
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:11,125
Well... Show him things
that could help him remember the past.

34
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,750
He didn't remember me after seeing me.

35
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,792
It made me feel hurt.

36
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:20,083
If I may be so bold to speak,
I believe this is to be expected.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,542
As the owner of the Holy Sword, Lady Aileen,

38
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,917
your affinity with Master Claude's memory
is poor.

39
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:30,458
Is it because of the "Holy" nature
of the Holy Sword?

40
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:35,875
Yes. I believe Master Claude's memory
is perhaps related to magic.

41
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:41,208
Encountering demons should rouse his magic
and make them a better stimulus.

42
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:46,333
Indeed. Master Claude has a deep connection
with the demons.

43
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:52,042
Speaking of demons, there are reports
of demons sightings on the streets.

44
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:56,083
They're risking themselves coming out
of the jungle to look for Master Claude.

45
00:03:56,083 --> 00:04:01,208
Which also means,
this inspection is related to the demons.

46
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:03,875
By the way,

47
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,250
this is from Doni. He says it's a blueprint.

48
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,167
Thank you.

49
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,958
Isaac, what are you making?

50
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,375
Well, this and that, just in case.

51
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,042
What plans do you have next?

52
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll infiltrate Master Claude's inspection.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,583
Which is why Master Claude,

54
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,625
please keep it a secret
if you see me during the inspection next week.

55
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,458
I... refuse.

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,917
I was about to say, what are you up to
bursting in from the terrace?

57
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,375
It's been three days.

58
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,458
What are you doing?

59
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,917
Things a fiancee will do.

60
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:41,333
I'm going to break off the engagement.

61
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:47,250
Before you break it off, I will make it
so your body can't live without me.

62
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:01,000
Master Claude, I brought you apple pie.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,167
I don't need it.

64
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,417
What are you reading?

65
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,083
It has nothing to do with you.

66
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,125
This is fun.

67
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,667
I don't think it's fun at all.

68
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:19,125
This is the first time
I'm having unrequited love. It feels amazing.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,458
Master Claude. Are you awake?

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,708
Stay there and don't come out.

71
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,333
Master Claude. How are you feeling?

72
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,000
What brought both of you here?

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,667
We are here to tell you about the changes
to the inspection's schedule.

74
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,083
I made some cookies.

75
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,792
Please have them.

76
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,583
That basket... Is there a snack in there?

77
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,792
That's...

78
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:59,333
I had the maids prepare them.

79
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,125
If only you had told me earlier.

80
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,292
What am I going to do with the cookies?

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,292
Since you prepared them, let me enjoy them.

82
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:10,292
Can you also make some tea?

83
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,333
No problem.

84
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:16,500
He didn't want my apple pie just now.

85
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,667
Regarding the inspection,

86
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,917
there have been a lot of demons
sighted in the imperial capital.

87
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,250
Demons?

88
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,667
Don't worry. We will have
the Holy Knights' apprentices coming along.

89
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:32,458
Even if demons were to come out,
they're just small fries.

90
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,792
I'll be trying out the dress for the inspection.

91
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:40,625
It's almost time for me to go.

92
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,292
Don't you have to go with her, Cedric?

93
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,708
No. I'll rest a bit more.

94
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,917
Oh, Master Claude.
You haven't had any cookies, right?

95
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,208
Taste one.

96
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,375
Here.

97
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,250
Lilia, Cedric is here too.

98
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,625
Don't make him misunderstand.

99
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,875
But, I'll call you
brother-in-law one day, anyway.

100
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,417
So, Cedric won't be mad.

101
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,500
Right?

102
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:13,125
Lilia, brother is a modest man.

103
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,208
Don't trouble him.

104
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,333
All right.

105
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,708
Master Claude, I will come again to see you.

106
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:26,000
She's still the same.
Trying to court another's fiancee.

107
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,875
Brother. I feel so sorry

108
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,625
that Lilia said such things.

109
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,625
What?

110
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:39,583
It's fine.
Since Cedric has already noticed anyway.

111
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,083
Is that so?

112
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,708
I just thought the basket looked familiar.

113
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,792
As expected of Miss Lilia.

114
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:54,042
The cookies are good, Master Claude.

115
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,000
Is that so?

116
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,250
I'm going back now.

117
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,417
What? Why are you giving it to me?

118
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,208
Wastes will always go to the waste bins.

119
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:09,625
Waste... Wait. Are you calling me a waste bin?

120
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:14,417
Master Claude.
Next time, I will bring better cookies.

121
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,208
You don't have to.

122
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,208
See you during the inspection.

123
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,458
Wait. Are you serious about coming...

124
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,625
Did you learn anything?

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,042
I learned how it hurts in unrequited love.

126
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,625
Forgive me for being presumptuous,

127
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,000
but Master Claude
should see the look on your face now.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Men are weak to women's tears.

129
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,625
Never. I don't intend to win him over with tears.

130
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,833
Aileen. It's bad.

131
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,458
Fight! A fight!

132
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,458
I want you to return it to me.

133
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,333
I can't. This is Demon Snuff.

134
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,167
You're annoying. Give it back to me.

135
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,917
Why are you always in the imperial castle?

136
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,000
It was agreed that you would not leave Mirchetta.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,208
That's why Master Claude let you go.

138
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,250
It's none of your business.
This has nothing to do with you.

139
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,458
-Of course it does. Don't break your promise.
-Have they been like this?

140
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,792
-Auguste was patrolling
-You're annoying. Give it back.

141
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:25,500
-and saw her by chance so he brought her here.
-I said never.

142
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,292
Are you done?

143
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,250
Know your place!

144
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,458
It has been a while, Selena.

145
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,750
Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

146
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,500
You're the last person I want to meet.

147
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,251
Are you here at the capital to see Master Cedric?

148
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:47,583
You must be here in search of support, right?

149
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,833
First of all, it must be Miss Lilia who was
once related to you that you're coming for.

150
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:56,042
Next, it must be her fiance, Master Cedric.

151
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:02,417
Master Cedric has the ability
to protect the status of women and their future.

152
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:06,500
You're good at your plots,
becoming a mistress is also possible.

153
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,917
You sound like you know me.

154
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,125
You're indeed the ex-fiancee.

155
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,542
Mistress... It can't be.

156
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,667
I'll marry a rich man
after my graduation, anyway.

157
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,250
I just want to marry someone rich and in power.
What is wrong with that?

158
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,667
It's true. It's worth a shot.

159
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,333
Thanks for your understanding.

160
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,708
Can you let me go now?

161
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,208
Auguste. Return everything to her,
except the Demon Snuff.

162
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,458
But...

163
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,354
Selena. If you have any intelligence
you wish to provide, send me a message.

164
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:56,458
I can give you what you want.

165
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,125
I'll walk you out.

166
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,542
Whatever.

167
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,708
Auguste. Is this going to be all right?

168
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,042
I don't know.

169
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:20,542
She'll get married right after graduation...

170
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,208
Everyone has their own story.

171
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,042
If you care about everything,
there won't be an end to it.

172
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,917
Actually, I think she is being silly.

173
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:32,750
She's always playing nice in school
in front of others.

174
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,625
But, I guess she is trying very hard too.

175
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:40,583
Since you know that, you should face her.

176
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,250
Yes. You're right.

177
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,417
I'll look for her.

178
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,625
You used to respect Miss Lilia so much
but you're trying to court her husband now.

179
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,375
It's because this is about my life.
It's only natural to do that.

180
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,542
Initially, I wanted to ask
the Holy Sword Maiden for help.

181
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,542
But...

182
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,750
Is that woman trouble?

183
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,708
No. It's just bothering me.

184
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:19,583
I couldn't tell what the woman was up to.

185
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:24,458
Wouldn't it be dangerous
to try to get her fiance then?

186
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,875
I have nothing else to lose anymore.

187
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:31,917
Selena!

188
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,708
Let me send you back.

189
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,958
I have to apologize to you.

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,042
Even though I can't forgive you
for what you did to James.

191
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,750
If you can't forgive me, why are you here?

192
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,375
Are you trying to show that you're kind?

193
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,667
No...

194
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,708
Don't come after me anymore.
I'm disgusted by you.

195
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:01,833
ELEPHAS LEVI
CV UCHIYAMA KOKI

196
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,750
THE LAST DESCENDANT OF
LEVI, THE MAGIC GRAND DUKES

197
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,750
THE LEVI TRIBE
IS SEEN AS A TRIBE WITH DANGEROUS MAGIC

198
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,542
THE KINGDOM HELD HOSTAGES OF THE YOUNG
AND OLD AND COERCED THEM INTO BECOMING

199
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,750
THE MAGE THAT PROTECTS THE ROYAL FAMILY ELMIR
WHO ARE ACTIVE IN THE DARK

200
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,083
These apprentices
are going to escort Your Highness's carriage.

201
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,167
Raise your heads, all of you.

202
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,750
This is Aili Kahlua.

203
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,917
He'll take command of the entire unit.

204
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:27,208
Take command...
Don't tell me, is she the captain?

205
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,750
No... I mean he...

206
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,917
Yes.

207
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:35,958
He's strong and
can bring down the Holy Knights alone.

208
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,542
Alone?

209
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,458
It's said that he'll have a bright future.

210
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,083
Bright future...

211
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,667
Aili Kahlua.
Escort Your Highness to the carriage.

212
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,875
The rest of you, get ready for departure.

213
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,875
Yes!

214
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,417
Your Highness. This way, please.

215
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,792
What are you doing?

216
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,917
You'll be executed if you meet me.

217
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:06,458
As long as Master Claude and I have an engagement

218
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,333
I won't be executed.

219
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,000
Are you threatening me?

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,042
Go back, now.

221
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,167
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

222
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,500
Brother. It's pointless for you to say that

223
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,958
because this is the type of woman she is.

224
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,000
Hurry up and return to your post.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,250
Do you want me to unmask you?

226
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,500
Try it if you dare.

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,750
This time,
I will plunge you into the depths of hell.

228
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,417
What are you saying?

229
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:38,375
You must have hidden Selena
in a safe place, right?

230
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,667
Selena? What are you talking about?

231
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,708
You can pretend all you want.

232
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,208
I'm just blabbering.

233
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,583
Blabbering to a talking waste bin.

234
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,167
You... What do you think I am?

235
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,958
You two have a good relationship.

236
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,542
It must be weird for me to be here.

237
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:59,708
I'm leaving.

238
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,958
But, Master Claude.

239
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,500
Don't come near me.

240
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,542
You're still the same as always.

241
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,625
Naturally, Brother would feel uncomfortable.

242
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,917
Master Claude feels uncomfortable?

243
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,750
Miss Aileen. The carriage is about to leave.

244
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,000
All right. How is the plan?

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,542
Yes. It's just as planned.

246
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:36,042
Besides, I found the person
in charge of this inspection too.

247
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,792
Person in charge? Isn't it Master Cedric?

248
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,500
It's a high government official named Leister Craine.

249
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,167
He appears to have planned the routes as well.

250
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,458
Leister...

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,333
I remember he is a character
that can be tamed from the first game.

252
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,625
A calm and levelheaded strategist.

253
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,750
Which also means,
Miss Lilia who is also familiar with the game

254
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,833
has tamed him.

255
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:13,458
It seems I have to stay away
from Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

256
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,542
She is related to my past.

257
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,333
Master Claude. Sorry for making you wait.

258
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,250
Where is Cedric?

259
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,375
He's not feeling well.

260
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,667
He plans to rest in the castle today.

261
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,083
Is it fine that you're not with him?

262
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,542
And being alone with a man
who is not your fiance...

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,667
It's all right.

264
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:40,375
Master Claude and I
are going to be family one day.

265
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,750
Do you feel bored being with me?

266
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,958
No. I just think that I'm unreliable.

267
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,875
Why are you saying that?

268
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,792
You just have to stay the way you are

269
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,958
because you're an important person.

270
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,042
What?

271
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,583
I've never heard
that a carriage could be lifted like that...

272
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,458
Lilia!

273
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,792
Demon in front. Return Master Claude.

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,708
Return. You. No way.

275
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,083
Save the Demon King!

276
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,167
Protect the Demon King!

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,250
Is he talking about me?

278
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,875
Almond. Lure this one to the plaza.

279
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,375
We'll catch him there.

280
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,667
Got it.

281
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,958
Unit One, follow me.

282
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,250
Fenrir Unit, chase the humans away.

283
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,583
Holy Sword.

284
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,875
Where's Master Claude?

285
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:17,792
Miss Aileen.

286
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,792
-Protect His Highness.
-Yes!

287
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,167
Do not shoot!

288
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:31,833
Shoot!

289
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,750
They are saved.

290
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,208
Hold it.

291
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,625
Everyone, take the demon away.

292
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,292
It seems like we don't need the sedatives.

293
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,167
It's larger than imagined.

294
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:11,292
Next, let's take them to the castle.

295
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:16,458
Yes. Protecting him under the Holy Knight's name
can protect his reputation.

296
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,708
Very clever.

297
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,250
This is a small matter.

298
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,375
Put them down.

299
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:39,667
How troublesome.

300
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,208
Demon King!

301
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,083
Save. Demon King.

302
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,000
No.

303
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,250
Don't hurt the humans. Retreat.

304
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,875
But... the Demon King's wishes...

305
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,417
What are you talking about?

306
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:06,750
It seems like I should stay away
from Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

307
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,083
You.

308
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,375
You're in the Demon King's way. Be gone.

309
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,042
The hearts of the demon
and Demon King are connected.

310
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,208
So, this means...

311
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,583
I don't need you. Be gone.

312
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,167
I'm... the woman who is not needed?

313
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,708
Be gone!

314
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,542
Aili. What are you doing?

315
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,792
Walt! Lyle!

316
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,125
Kill it!

317
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,625
No way!

318
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,000
Master Claude would be very sad.

319
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,083
What a fool.

320
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,500
Treating the Demon King's intention as an order.

321
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:07,250
Demon King. We will do as you wish.

322
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,750
If the Demon King doesn't need us,

323
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,875
we will disappear before you.

324
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:30,875
Master Claude is so obsessed with me
that you'd have the demons dispose of me.

325
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,083
-I... I didn't...
-Smile.

326
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,542
Just as you always do.

327
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,958
I know this is only my unrequited love.

328
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,792
I have misunderstood.

329
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:45,083
But...

330
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,542
If I've causing you trouble, I will leave!

331
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,167
I will not go to the ball too.
