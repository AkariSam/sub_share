1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,542
Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,458
I want to terminate

3
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,833
our engagement.

4
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,958
What?

5
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,917
Terminate the engagement?

6
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,292
Did he say terminate the engagement?

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,000
With me?

8
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:37,375
No way.

9
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,042
No. I remember...

10
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,958
Somewhere...

11
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,667
This scene.

12
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,391
I've seen it a few times in my dream.

13
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,625
The crown prince of Elmir Empire,

14
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,958
Cedric Jeanne Elmir.

15
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,625
My fiance.

16
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,292
He is the game's main love interest character.

17
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:17,917
Main love interest character?

18
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:22,708
I've decided to live
the rest of my life with Lilia.

19
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,542
Miss Aileen, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,500
Lilia Rainworth.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,583
Born a commoner
and became the daughter of a baron.

22
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,667
The game's heroine.

23
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,708
Game? Heroine?

24
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:39,000
I've had enough of your actions
and your arrogance.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,583
Aileen.

26
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,208
Aileen. Isn't she...

27
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,333
The heroine's rival.

28
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,000
The villainous daughter, Aileen?

29
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,875
I finally know what's going on.

30
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:58,750
This is the world of a game
I'm obsessed with in my previous life.

31
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,250
Miss Lilia is so pitiful.

32
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,000
I heard she was being ordered
to not greet other people.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,208
Giving orders at the academy soiree.

34
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:11,750
I remember this scene.
It's the "Engagement Termination" event.

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,000
I was being tricked.

36
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,750
Since you won't listen to my explanation,
I'll be taking my leave then.

37
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,958
I'm not crying as you had hoped

38
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,417
-so it's really a pity.
-I have to smile.

39
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,542
I can't let them feel like
they have the upper hand.

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,750
Lord Cedric.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,042
I used to admire you.

42
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:56,792
This is the world of the Otome game,
"Regalia of Saints, Demons and Maidens".

43
00:02:56,792 --> 00:03:00,750
The heroine, Lilia, is
the legendary Holy Sword Maiden.

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,792
She will have a battle
with the awakened Demon King.

45
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:03,833
VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER, AILEEN

46
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,375
Meanwhile, Aileen's endings

47
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,583
"DEATH"
are all deaths in ridiculous ways.

48
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,000
Even if I die a cruel death in the game,

49
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,500
I can't die in real life.

50
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,667
Think. Remember.

51
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,292
What I can do in this situation is...

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,583
The key to a Bad End
is the awakening of the Demon King.

53
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,625
So,

54
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,917
to stop him from awakening,

55
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,583
I have to keep the Last Boss!

56
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,667
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

57
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,583
THE VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER RAISES THE CURTAIN

58
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,667
It's full of bad omens.

59
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,542
Human, turn back.

60
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,500
The girl who got her engagement terminated.

61
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,292
So many bad things have been said about you.

62
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,167
Capricious. Arrogant.

63
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,625
Simply humiliating others.
Is that how you treat your guests?

64
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,208
I am Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

65
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:52,000
I have no intention to leave
before I see your master.

66
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,833
I've inherited the blood of
the Holy Sword Maiden after all.

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,167
This is nothing to me.

68
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,750
Let me help you.

69
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,500
Thanks for your help...

70
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,958
Hold on...

71
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,250
This is far more potent
than the still drawing in the game.

72
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,625
How disgustingly gorgeous!

73
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,958
What does a human want with me?

74
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,167
You must be Claude Jeanne Elmir.

75
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,250
That's right.

76
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,875
I think this is a good deal.

77
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,167
I want you

78
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,625
to marry me!

79
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:04,833
You would like

80
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,792
who to marry whom?

81
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,417
I am the youngest daughter of a duke.

82
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,292
I was born into a loving family.

83
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:32,208
However, I'm a girl
who is not as excellent as my brothers.

84
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,958
I couldn't catch up
with my brothers no matter how hard I worked.

85
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:40,375
So, I've always thought I am worthless.

86
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:46,792
When I was eight years old,
Prince Cedric proposed to me.

87
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,542
It was my first time being relied upon.

88
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:54,292
Becoming the empress became Aileen's dream.

89
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,542
To become an amazing empress,

90
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,375
perhaps I've worked too hard.

91
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,375
When I realised,

92
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:07,167
I was already referred to as an arrogant woman
because I'm the crown prince's fiancee.

93
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,958
I should have presented myself
as a cute and delicate girl.

94
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,125
Would things have been different?

95
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,083
The Demon King wasn't angry.

96
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,917
The thunder was caused by his shock.

97
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,958
He didn't... Get angry?

98
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,875
Indeed.

99
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,917
If Master Claude gets angry,
there will be a catastrophe.

100
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,250
Why are you taking care of him?

101
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,583
I had no choice.

102
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:39,792
-Did she propose to you, Master Claude?
-I remember he has two close advisors.

103
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,542
Their names are Keith

104
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:44,417
-and the demon, Belzebuth.
-Are you planning to nurse this girl?

105
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,208
I don't plan to do that.

106
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,625
She might have received someone's orders.

107
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,083
This might be a trap.

108
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,000
No.

109
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:58,625
I came here of my own free will.

110
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,625
Claude Jeanne Elmir.

111
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,625
Cedric's half-brother.

112
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,292
He was discovered to be a demon
when he was 10 years old.

113
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,833
The humans stripped his right
to inherit the throne.

114
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,750
The demons and humans
formed a non-aggression pact

115
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,917
and he was banished to the abandoned castle.

116
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,500
If his hatred for the humans has been awakened,

117
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,125
he will transform into the final boss dragon
that kills Aileen.

118
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,542
To avoid this Bad End...

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,750
Marry me! I'll give you happiness!

120
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,375
Throw her out.

121
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,375
I'll return immediately
if you agree to my proposal.

122
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,792
It's our first meeting.

123
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,333
Why are you proposing to me?

124
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,375
It's because... Well...

125
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,625
Do you like me?

126
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,917
No.

127
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:54,750
Master Claude! No tornados, please!

128
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,417
After having your engagement terminated
by Cedric,

129
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,083
how can you still...

130
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:07,125
This is my last resort.

131
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,417
I don't want to cry my whole life.

132
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:14,458
I don't want to waste
a single second of my life.

133
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,833
So, you came to seduce the Demon King?

134
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,750
Seduce...

135
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,208
Yes. Seducing a man is easy for me...

136
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:32,708
I apologise for my appearance.

137
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,458
I'll return when I've dressed appropriately.

138
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,958
There's no need for that.

139
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,458
There's no reason for you to return.

140
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,708
Get lost.

141
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,208
I will cherish it.

142
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:55,417
A dress enchanted with magic. It's amazing!

143
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,875
Is this magic as well?

144
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,833
Get lost!

145
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,208
He forced me back using magic?

146
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,958
He got me.

147
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,875
Aileen, you seem to be doing better
than I expected.

148
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,917
I am so disappointed.

149
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,292
This sadist father.

150
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,792
It's quite shocking to see that this is the
true personality of the empire's prime minister.

151
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:41,000
We received an invitation
from Lord Cedric and Miss Lilia.

152
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:49,042
They will announce their engagement
at the banquet two months later.

153
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:54,042
You have to sign the document
to terminate your engagement in public.

154
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:58,500
Dumping me once again in public?

155
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,333
What do you plan to do?

156
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:04,750
Miss Lilia even included a handwritten letter.

157
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,667
I will attend it.

158
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:12,500
I'll accept anyone's challenge.

159
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,732
I still need Master Claude's help
no matter what.

160
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,292
2 KILOMETRES TO THE DEMON KING'S CASTLE

161
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:24,792
I've been walking around in circles!

162
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,000
Is it because of the barrier?

163
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,500
What a pity!

164
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,250
I even prepared some sweets as an apology.

165
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,000
Also.

166
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,333
How you treat your guests
will affect your Master's reputation.

167
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,958
The one responsible should wear this.

168
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,000
A gatekeeper's proof.

169
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,250
Gatekeeper's proof?

170
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,833
Child!

171
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,833
Give that to me!

172
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:11,417
It suits you.

173
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,000
Please try some if you don't mind.

174
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,542
I want almond.

175
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:19,792
Delicious.

176
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,917
What's going on?

177
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,833
I laced it with a paralysis drug.

178
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,208
I didn't expect you to trust humans.

179
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,208
How foolish.

180
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,042
Is this what a human would say?

181
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,792
Well then, Master Claude! Come out at once!

182
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:47,542
Otherwise, I'll pluck
all the feathers off this demon...

183
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,375
and turn it into a bald crow!

184
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,250
Bald crow?

185
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,208
Good day, Master Claude.

186
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,667
Please heal it.

187
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:14,042
Child, I'll kill you! I'll definitely kill you!

188
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:17,000
You were the one who slandered me yesterday.

189
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,500
We are even now.

190
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,000
I will no longer be fooled!

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,083
Don't worry.

192
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,500
Only the ones with almonds
are laced with the drug.

193
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,500
There's nothing wrong with it.

194
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,083
Delicious. Chocolate is delicious!

195
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,792
Oh no. What should I do?

196
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,000
Did you put something in this as well?

197
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,542
Yes. I want to put Master Claude
in the mood for "that"

198
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,917
and added a love potion.

199
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,500
You are so weird.

200
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,333
Actually, I need to attend
a banquet two months from now.

201
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,958
I want Master Claude to be my escort.

202
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,042
Why did you use a love potion then?

203
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:16,125
Because you might not listen to me
if I had requested nicely.

204
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,542
So, I want you to do something
that cannot be undone.

205
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,542
Demon King!

206
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,000
Almond.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,958
Don't simply name me as you wish!

208
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,792
Ignore her. What is it?

209
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,333
Ran outside the forest!

210
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,833
Fenrir's child.

211
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,042
It escaped to the second layer in the east.

212
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,750
It has exceeded the barrier's limit.

213
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,833
That's the academy's direction.

214
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,958
I can't imagine what will happen
if the students see it.

215
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,875
I'll go and find it.

216
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,458
If humans see you,
it will cause a commotion, Belzebuth.

217
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,667
I'm going.

218
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:02,375
I know the layout of the academy well.

219
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,583
Even if it's a child, it is still a Fenrir.

220
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,708
It might bite you to death.

221
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,792
In that case, lend this to me.

222
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,208
Demons should be able to identify your scent.

223
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,542
Why? There's no need to help us.

224
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,375
I feel bad for the poor lost child.

225
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:26,083
Of course, I also want
Master Claude to owe me a favour.

226
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,917
So, that's your plan...

227
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,750
I want to grant your wish.

228
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,250
I'm counting on you.

229
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,667
I'm counting on you?

230
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,458
It feels good to be relied on.

231
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,760
I have to help the lost child.

232
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,708
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

233
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,583
AILEEN LAUREN DAUTRICHE
CV, RIE TAKAHASHI

234
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,458
THE MOST POWERFUL NOBLE FAMILY IN ELMIR EMPIRE.
BARON DAUTRICHE'S ONLY DAUGHTER.

235
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,333
HER FATHER IS THE PRIME MINISTER.
HER MOTHER IS THE EMPRESS DOWAGER'S NIECE.

236
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,208
RESPECTED BY SOCIAL AND MILITARY CLASSES.
DUCHESS.

237
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,042
HAS ROYAL BLOOD,
INHERITED THE HOLY SWORD MAIDEN'S BLOOD.

238
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:09,750
Great!

239
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,958
Aim for its head!

240
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:16,083
Do it while it's trapped.

241
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,208
If we kill it, joining the Holy Knights
will no longer be a dream.

242
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,708
Are you trying to kill a demon?

243
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,466
Haven't you heard of the non-aggression pact?

244
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,167
Miss Aileen?

245
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,917
Weren't you expelled from the academy?

246
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,098
Nice to meet you. I am Aileen.

247
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,708
I'm here to pick you up.

248
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,792
What are you doing?

249
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,375
We can't let the demon escape!

250
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,083
I said stop it!

251
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,683
The parent came out of the barrier
to find its child?

252
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,250
No roaring. You will attract the humans.

253
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,000
Hurry.

254
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,833
Aileen!

255
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,292
Lord Cedric.

256
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:56,667
I received reports of you
harming demons and planning to attack Lilia.

257
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:00,458
Do you think I'm someone
who will come up with such a silly plan?

258
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,125
It's highly possible for you.

259
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,167
Wait.

260
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,875
I don't think Miss Aileen will do that,

261
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,208
Lord Cedric.

262
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll forgive you today because of Lilia.

263
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,583
Leave this place now.

264
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,458
But Miss Aileen is hurt...

265
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,375
She deserved that. She can crawl home.

266
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,375
Marcus, let's go.

267
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,625
Poor thing.

268
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,750
It doesn't hurt me at all.

269
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,167
I no longer care about my reputation...

270
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,167
Brother?

271
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,958
Demon King?

272
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,417
He shouldn't be leaving the forest.

273
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,542
Brother, why are you here?

274
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,458
Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

275
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,583
Yes.

276
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,042
I'm here to thank you.

277
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,583
You did not fear the child of Fenrir

278
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,500
and rescued it.

279
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,167
You are willing to take the blame

280
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,458
to avoid a conflict between demons and humans.

281
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,000
As the Demon King,

282
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,667
I sincerely thank you.

283
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,417
He is here to save me...

284
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,125
Helping me to clear my name.

285
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:36,417
It doesn't benefit you even if you do that.

286
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,875
Let me send you back.

287
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,583
Where did that come from?

288
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,208
It's too early to be startled.

289
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,250
It's so pretty.

290
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,875
You look like a normal girl from a noble family.

291
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,625
Excuse me. I am indeed
a normal girl from a noble family.

292
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:27,625
I already know you are someone who doesn't
find excuses, seek help and cry easily.

293
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,375
That is why you won't tell me
the reason for your proposal.

294
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,458
Because you won't believe me even if I tell you.

295
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,583
That's not for you to decide.

296
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,333
I'll tell you then.

297
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,750
Actually, this world

298
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,083
is an Otome game I played in my previous life.

299
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,500
I'm the villainous daughter in the game.

300
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,000
I will be killed by Lord Claude
who turns into an evil dragon.

301
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,708
I see. I understand now.

302
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,792
You are fooling around with me.

303
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:05,792
No way!

304
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,375
I'm going to die?

305
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,208
A meteor?

306
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,792
What are you doing?

307
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,000
What's the meaning of this?

308
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I will attend the banquet.

309
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,000
Then, we'll be even

310
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,667
and your wish will be granted.

311
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,917
That's true.

312
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:51,167
But why...

313
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,042
Are you smiling?

314
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,542
Because

315
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,875
I want to see you cry.

316
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,708
Can I escape my fate

317
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:37,208
of dying a cruel death in the end?
