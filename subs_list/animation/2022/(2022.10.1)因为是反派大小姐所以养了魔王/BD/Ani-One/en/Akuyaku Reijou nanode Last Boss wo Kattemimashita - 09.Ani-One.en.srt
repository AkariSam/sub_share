1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,750
Cedric.

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,208
Brother. How unusual.

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:16,292
The empress dowager summoned me.

4
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:19,833
Grandmother? Please be careful.

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:24,708
Sorry for making you worried all the time.

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,250
Worried about you?

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,875
Aren't we siblings
fighting to become the emperor?

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,292
It's not us who are fighting
to become the emperor, isn't it?

9
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:35,375
It's me and you, Brother.

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,042
I will become the emperor in the end.

11
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:38,833
For your fiancee's sake?

12
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:44,083
Yes. Isn't that Aileen's wish as well?
That is why you wanted to become the emperor.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,625
Let me give you some advice.

14
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,792
A woman gets tired quickly
when a man always obeys her.

15
00:00:56,292 --> 00:01:00,125
Brother. Lilia seems to be plotting something.

16
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,750
Be careful.

17
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,542
That's all I can tell you.

18
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:39,542
I'M THE VILLAINESS, SO I'M TAMING THE FINAL BOSS!

19
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,458
THE VILLAINESS IS BEST FORGOTTEN

20
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,833
Show me your other merchandise.

21
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,958
How much for that?

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
I wondered where you were taking us.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,083
Turns out it was an underground auction.

24
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,375
Is it true that
there's going to be a Demon Snuff transaction?

25
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,750
That's right.
They are also selling demons as well.

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,208
If something happens, Auguste will
take action as a member of the Holy Knights.

27
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:19,208
Does Master Claude know about this?

28
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,208
Well...

29
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,792
You shouldn't hide from the Demon King, right?

30
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,042
You just angered him recently.

31
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:29,958
What are you talking about?
Master Claude has always been gentle to me.

32
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,500
Anyway, let the operation commence.

33
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,250
Split into two groups and investigate.

34
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,792
I'm not used to places like this.

35
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,042
You'll gain experience
once a bad woman lies to you for one night.

36
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,750
I'm already...

37
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,708
The demons have escaped!

38
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,333
It must be James. Now's the time.

39
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:06,167
Auguste, keep watch over the corridor.
If anything unusual happens...

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,250
Aili!

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,292
Magic?

42
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,583
Don't worry. I'm on your side.

43
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:32,792
Nice to meet you. Miss Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

44
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,042
You are a mage.

45
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,833
Yes. It might not be right

46
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,833
but I came here to meet with the Demon King.

47
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,667
There's an intruder! Check the situation inside!

48
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,708
Here.

49
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,625
This way, please.

50
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,542
No. We haven't found any evidence yet.

51
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,792
I have the guest list.

52
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,167
Incredible.

53
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,500
I'll consider letting you meet Master Claude
in exchange for that.

54
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,333
Thank you very much.

55
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,708
I found the suspicious people!

56
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,625
All right, hurry up.

57
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,083
The men have escaped!

58
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,208
Find the woman!

59
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,500
How do we escape?

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,250
I can control the wind. Just jump down.

61
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,167
This is the room! Break in!

62
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,667
Bring an axe!

63
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,792
Can you tell me your name?

64
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,875
Sorry for not introducing myself.

65
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,958
I am Elephas Levi.

66
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,417
"REGALIA OF SAINTS, DEMONS AND MAIDENS"
The final boss of the first game's

67
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,917
spin-off fan disc?

68
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,292
Aili!

69
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,292
If you want to take a stroll at night,

70
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,375
you just have to tell me.

71
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,583
You are not being honest,

72
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,542
my dear Aileen.

73
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,500
What have you been doing behind my back again?

74
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,667
After long consideration,

75
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,542
I don't think we need any words between us.

76
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,542
This is my conclusion.

77
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:27,458
I think we still need to speak with each other
to understand each other better.

78
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:32,708
Seems like your body needs to physically
understand how important you are to me.

79
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:38,000
We aren't married yet!
We can't do things like that.

80
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,875
Find. I'll ask them to leave.

81
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,833
That's not the point!

82
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,208
I have something to tell you.

83
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,875
What is it?

84
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,625
Someone wants to meet you.

85
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,083
A mage.
You've picked up something fascinating again.

86
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,250
What is your name?

87
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,792
I am Elephas Levi.

88
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:14,000
It's an honour to meet you, Your Highness,
Crown Prince Claude Jeanne Elmir.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,958
Elephas Levi.

90
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,042
A descendant of the
Levi tribe of magic grand dukes?

91
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,375
I'm just serving the Elmir Empire at the moment.

92
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:27,375
As the crown prince, you should know about us.

93
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,083
The Levi tribe.

94
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:34,000
In the game,
they are a rare tribe born with magic.

95
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,667
The Elmir Empire thinks
their magic is related to the demons

96
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,375
so they have been treating
the mage tribe cruelly.

97
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:47,875
20 years ago, the Levi tribe
planned to expand their territory.

98
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,417
They declared war against the empire and lost.

99
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:58,042
After that, the tribe's children and elders
were taken as hostages

100
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:01,750
to force the mages
to protect the imperial family.

101
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,917
You are hoping me

102
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:11,667
to give the Levi tribe citizenship
of Elmir Empire once I become emperor.

103
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,292
Is that so?

104
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,000
Please save my tribe.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,917
That depends on how well you work.

106
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,417
Adding a new subordinate?

107
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,083
I'm against it.

108
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,083
The mage might resent the empire.

109
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:34,667
It means that he is also
a talent that's capable of taking revenge.

110
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,375
Isaac.

111
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:40,667
We are hoping for a world
where humans and demons coexist.

112
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,292
It's only natural to
save humans who have been treated cruelly.

113
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,333
You are not wrong.

114
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:51,958
Allow me to tell you
how wonderful Master Claude is.

115
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,833
Of course. I look forward to hearing that.

116
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,833
Demon King. I told you before.

117
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,417
Tie her up with a rope.

118
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,667
You are right.

119
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,792
That's all for tonight.

120
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,375
Good night. I love you.

121
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,125
Seriously.

122
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,458
Teleporting me back forcefully
before I'm done with my conversation.

123
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,250
What a relief.

124
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,875
The final boss this time
is my companion from the start.

125
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:34,042
Compared to the first game,
I don't really remember the fan disc's content.

126
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,833
I should've played the fan disc seriously.

127
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,750
Master Claude who turned
into a demon in the first game

128
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,125
was in the fan disc

129
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:48,375
"REGALIA OF SAINTS, DEMONS AND MAIDENS"
as another character that can be tamed.

130
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,167
But at that time...

131
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,208
Almond, come out!

132
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,542
Belzebuth is also fine!

133
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,458
What? No way...

134
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Miss Aileen, who are you calling?

135
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,083
I'm going to find Master Claude.

136
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,417
I'll leave the rest to you.

137
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:17,417
You're going out again?
It's the middle of the night.

138
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,958
Aileen, the Demon King...

139
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,750
Demon King. Gone.

140
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,042
No response!

141
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,167
The forest's barrier disappeared.

142
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,625
Aileen. Sorry for disturbing you.

143
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,583
Master.

144
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:45,500
A man stationed in the castle has reported to me.

145
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,333
Master Claude's stomach was stabbed by someone.

146
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,458
Demon King!

147
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,625
No way. Not long ago,

148
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,333
he just told me he loved me.

149
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:04,750
Thankfully, he is only injured
and isn't in a critical situation.

150
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,167
However, he seems to have lost his memory.

151
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,750
Love is always lost in an instant.

152
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,375
It happened the first time.

153
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,167
It happened again the second time.

154
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,292
SELENA GILBERT
CV AYANA TAKETATSU

155
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,417
THE HEROINE OF
"REGALIA OF SAINTS, DEMONS AND MAIDENS 2"

156
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,500
CONSIDERATE, GOOD AT COOKING.
BORN INTO A BAD FAMILY.

157
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,833
HAS BEEN HELPING THE FEMALE STUDENTS SINCE SHE
ENROLLED IN THE MALE-DOMINATED ACADEMY.

158
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,292
What's going on?

159
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,375
Why can't I meet Master Claude?

160
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,875
My son, Crown Prince Claude,
has lost his memory and magic.

161
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,875
He is no longer the Demon King.

162
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,958
Separating him from the demons
and letting him live as a human

163
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,125
will be the best opportunity for him
to truly become the emperor.

164
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,167
Your Majesty.

165
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,333
What about Crown Prince's engagement
with my daughter?

166
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,708
We don't intend to cancel it immediately.

167
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,125
I will think of a time and a reason.

168
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,458
How can you be so reckless?

169
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,625
Claude no longer retains his previous memories.

170
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,167
I hope to give him another chance to reconsider.

171
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:12,583
Now that he's human again,
he will no doubt be highly sought after.

172
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,875
You must be Aileen.

173
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,292
I believe this is our first meeting.

174
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:21,833
It's an honour to be remembered, Your Majesty.

175
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,000
You are a young and pretty lady.

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,833
I'm jealous.

177
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,917
I heard about the rumours

178
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,500
but is she really past sixty?

179
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,208
Actually, I plan to host a ball recently.

180
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:41,875
Don't you think this is a good opportunity
to choose a wife for my cute grandson?

181
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:47,792
I'm impressed
by Your Majesty's political talents.

182
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:51,833
However, I don't think
our family has received an invitation.

183
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,250
There must an error with the program.

184
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,250
However, wouldn't it be troublesome
if I send you the invitation now?

185
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,375
I am still Master Claude's fiancee!

186
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:06,958
Cedric and Lilia are doing their best
to take care of him.

187
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,333
There's no need for you to worry.

188
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,083
Let me meet with him at least!

189
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,792
I want to see for myself
whether Master Claude is really fine.

190
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,083
How unseemly.

191
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,042
Shouldn't you back away
if you really love him as you claimed?

192
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,458
Pardon our intrusion.

193
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,708
Lilia insists on coming.

194
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,208
Grandmother!

195
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,917
It's a pity for Lady Aileen to break up.

196
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,792
What is this woman plotting?

197
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,750
Breaking the engagement
when Brother has lost his memory isn't right.

198
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,250
After all, everyone knows
how close she was to Brother.

199
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,542
Yes. At least invite her to the ball.

200
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:59,208
Fine. I will invite her to the ball.

201
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,292
However, if you meet Claude before the ball,

202
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:06,625
I'll execute you
for disobeying an imperial edict.

203
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:14,167
I wonder what you can do in a single ball.

204
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,083
Grandmother, it'll be fine.

205
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,292
Miss Aileen is the main character.

206
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,958
She won't lose to a scenario like this.

207
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:21,833
Am I right?

208
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,833
Let's have some more fun.

209
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,458
Lady Aileen.

210
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,875
That's what this is.

211
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,917
Yes, Miss Lilia.

212
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,250
I'll let you know that it won't happen twice.

213
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,375
That's the way.

214
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,083
I'm looking forward to it.

215
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,625
It'll be terribly cruel if this is reality.

216
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,542
Poor Miss Aileen.

217
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,167
Lilia, are you sure it's fine to do that?

218
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,917
What are you worried about?

219
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:10,042
We still haven't caught the culprit
who attacked Brother.

220
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,708
Besides...

221
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:16,333
He is worried that his excellent brother
will steal me away from him.

222
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,917
What a petty and boring man.

223
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,958
Lord Cedric, you've always been so kind.

224
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:31,208
A woman gets tired quickly
when a man always obeys her.

225
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,292
Aileen.

226
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,208
The Demon King...

227
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,292
I'll depend on you to save him.

228
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,458
Don't worry.

229
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:51,875
I'm the woman
who will become the Demon King's wife.

230
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,625
That must be the place.

231
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,958
We found this place thanks to Almond.

232
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,708
Seems like it is protected by a sacred barrier.

233
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,792
I can break through
a barrier like that any time I want.

234
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,083
Are they looking down on me?

235
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:14,333
No one will jump down from a cliff usually.

236
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,625
Let's go. Please cast your wind magic.

237
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,792
I'll break through the barrier
with the power of the Holy Sword.

238
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,125
Are you sure that's a good idea?

239
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,125
You'll be executed if you are discovered.

240
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,333
My resolve is firm.

241
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,458
Got it.

242
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,292
Give me your hand.

243
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,417
(Spell)

244
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,542
Holy Sword.

245
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:57,000
Incredible. You are using the sword well.

246
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,708
That's not true.

247
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,583
Sometimes, it won't listen to me.

248
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,458
Miss Aileen. Are you all right?

249
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,250
I'm fine.

250
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,750
I feel like the Holy Sword
has had a mind of its own recently.

251
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,208
Lord Cedric.

252
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,792
You are here to see Brother, right?

253
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:28,875
Follow me.

254
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,542
Brother's bedroom is inside.

255
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,083
You can do anything you want.

256
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,958
What's going on with you today?

257
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,792
All right. Just go inside.

258
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,708
I won't alert you if the patrol comes around.

259
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,417
Elephas, wait for me here.

260
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,667
Master Claude...

261
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,292
He's still alive.

262
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:25,000
What a relief. Nothing else matters
as long as you are fine.

263
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,375
Lilia...

264
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,417
Who are you?

265
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,833
Do you really not remember me?

266
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:47,583
It can be helped.

267
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,917
I understand.

268
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,792
Please marry me.

269
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,542
What are you talking about?

270
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:59,042
If you agree, you'll be able to live a happy
and comfortable life with me in the future.

271
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:02,042
Muster your courage and take that leap of faith.

272
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,208
Even if I've lost my memory,

273
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:08,250
I won't be so foolish
as to marry a person whom I don't know her name.

274
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,333
That was rude of me.

275
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,875
I am Aileen Lauren Dautriche,

276
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,083
your fiancee, Master Claude.

277
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,833
Are you Aileen?

278
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,833
I'm sorry. I don't want to get involved with you.

279
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,708
How can you be so cold?

280
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,708
I don't want to go back to being the Demon King.

281
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:35,583
It'll cause the empire a lot of trouble
if the crown prince is the Demon King.

282
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,833
Lilia and the rest saved me.
I don't want their efforts to go to waste.

283
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,833
Master Claude.

284
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,292
So, please cancel our engagement...

285
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,625
Please allow me to neglect your request.

286
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:57,333
I would've cut you if I didn't love you.

287
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:59,958
You love me?

288
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes. I wouldn't have risked my life
just to meet you otherwise.

289
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,583
What's going on?

290
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:11,458
Meeting Master Claude
meant that I'd disobeyed the imperial edict

291
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,083
and will be executed.

292
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,750
Just go back then.

293
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,042
I also think that it's a nuisance.

294
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,083
You are still just as kind as you were before.

295
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,167
I'm glad that you're safe.

296
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,958
As long as you're alive, I will confess my love
to you as many times as possible.

297
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,167
Go away.

298
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,625
A woman shouldn't simply hug a man.

299
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,000
I see.

300
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,208
You've become pure
once you are no longer the Demon King.

301
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,583
I really want to take you back right now.

302
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,458
I told you not to do that!

303
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,167
-What should I do? This is fun!
-Let me go!

304
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,042
Excuse me.

305
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,042
The patrols will be coming.

306
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,583
There's no choice.

307
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,125
Master Claude, I will return.

308
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,792
You should stop coming here.

309
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,167
Sorry for this.

310
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,042
What are you doing?

311
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,417
A souvenir. I'll take good care of them.

312
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,125
One last thing.

313
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,083
Master Claude, you mustn't have an affair.

314
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,042
Affair?

315
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,917
They should've advised you
to choose a new fiancee.

316
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,958
What fiancee?

317
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:27,458
I don't even know
if I'm fit to become the crown prince.

318
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,708
I have no time to...

319
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:30,958
What are you doing?

320
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,792
This is the Master Claude I love.

321
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:44,375
I will win over your heart
no matter how many times it takes me.

322
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,750
What's going on with that girl?

323
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,542
She is my fiancee?

324
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,417
If I fall in love with her again and again,

325
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:05,917
doesn't it mean that's fate?
