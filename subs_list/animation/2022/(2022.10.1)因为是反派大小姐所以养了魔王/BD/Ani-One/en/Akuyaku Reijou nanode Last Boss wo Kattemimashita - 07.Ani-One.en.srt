1
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,167
Who are you?

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:12,167
I've already said it just now...

3
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,208
Let me change my question.

4
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,917
You saw my true form, didn't you?

5
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,458
I'M THE VILLAINESS,
SO I'M TAMING THE FINAL BOSS!

6
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,000
THE VILLAINESS PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,167
Answer me if you don't want to die.

8
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,792
Are you keeping quiet?

9
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,625
Yet you are saying you want to help me?

10
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,917
What do you want to do to me?

11
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,792
Fine. I'll explain.

12
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,083
Come out, Ribbon.

13
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,292
Ask it to stop licking.

14
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,333
I want to protect you.

15
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,125
Protect me?

16
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,875
As you can see, I can summon demons.

17
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:32,792
I'm not working with the church
that wants to hunt you at least.

18
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,833
My target is Ashtart.

19
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,750
You know about Ashtart, right?

20
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:45,333
Ashtart is my name?

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,417
I am a half-demon.

22
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,750
The students of the academy

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,875
and even the members of the student council
don't know about this.

24
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:58,083
My father gave me the demon name, Ashtart.

25
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,125
It was a name I abandoned.

26
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,542
Was this a scenario in the game?

27
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:09,125
Why did the Ashtart who announced the attack
use that name?

28
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:13,917
I wonder.
Perhaps he wanted to make me the culprit.

29
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,292
Send this demon back.

30
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,792
It'll be troublesome if someone sees it.

31
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:26,500
Don't approach me carelessly.

32
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm not one of your own.

33
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,250
President James, you are similar
to the person I love.

34
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,958
What?

35
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,583
Anyway, I'll do my best to protect you.

36
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,000
Please help me out.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,417
Don't report it to the principal.

38
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,208
I refuse.

39
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,833
Come out, Ribbon.

40
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,750
All right. Stop using demons as your shield.

41
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,875
That's so despicable.

42
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,208
What about the demons in the town?

43
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,625
All of them have retreated.

44
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,625
Good.

45
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:07,125
I want all demons that have been
instigated by Ashtart to leave the town.

46
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:11,333
I'll go and have a look with Belzebuth tomorrow.

47
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,417
It's better if you stayed here, Master Claude.

48
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,083
I understand.

49
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,458
However, it's uncomfortable to be so restrained.

50
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,875
I wished...

51
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,583
Are you thinking of
going to the school festival?

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,708
I think I can make friends there.

53
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,500
Despite my appearance, I've never made a friend.

54
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,250
If that's your wish, I'll help you.

55
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,958
That's right. You should
start by learning how to greet people.

56
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,667
Hold on! You are here as the principal!

57
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,542
I know that...

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,875
Do you think being the Demon King is boring?

59
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,750
I just want to make friends.

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,625
Keith, since he said that,

61
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,833
let's prepare some friends immediately.

62
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,292
You can't prepare friends.

63
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:06,292
That's right.
Aileen is familiar with socialising.

64
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,583
I'll ask her to give me some advice.

65
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:15,292
With her around,
I won't have to give up on being human.

66
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:19,667
It's the academy! This is not socialising!

67
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,292
The purpose is totally different!

68
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,875
You can make friends in the future.

69
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,083
But...

70
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,875
I won't forgive you

71
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,583
if you go and have fun
when you're supposed to be working.

72
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,500
DAY 1 OF THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,125
We are the guard unit!

74
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,208
We are going to confiscate any prohibited items.

75
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,292
It's the school festival
so just let it go for once.

76
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,417
Hand it over.

77
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,250
It's not the Demon Snuff.

78
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,333
Let's find the next target, Jame...

79
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,292
Blue.

80
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,708
Why do I have to dress up like this?

81
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,625
Master Claude is concerned about the duck.

82
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,833
I have no choice
but to increase the number of ducks.

83
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,750
Red! Blue!

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,458
Augu... Pink!

85
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,292
Can you make it?

86
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,708
Don't you have to sign up for the contest?

87
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,708
It's that late already?

88
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,917
I have to go.

89
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,583
What is your name?

90
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,000
There are even outsiders participating.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Will Auguste win?

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,500
That muscle-head should have no problem.

93
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,917
What a relief. They are still accepting entries?

94
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,125
The Demon King?

95
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,833
Master Claude?

96
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,333
The number of ducks has increased.

97
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,500
Thanks for waiting.

98
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,917
Principal?

99
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,250
I'm not the principal.

100
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,000
Then... Demon King?

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,042
I'm wearing the Demon King's outfit

102
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,583
but I'm not the Demon King.

103
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm just a wandering traveller.

104
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,250
Just like a guard
pretending to be a normal person?

105
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,292
I see. I'll just have to tell Keith that.

106
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,458
We'll go with that.

107
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,042
Are you sure that's what you want?

108
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:12,792
He's enjoying the school festival
no matter how I see it.

109
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:16,958
Oh. I want you to teach me
how to participate in the swordsmanship contest.

110
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,833
I've completed my registration.
Let me teach you.

111
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,250
I also know some delicious food stalls.

112
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,208
Signing up is more important.
There's not much time left.

113
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,833
Has he always been worshipped easily

114
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,292
regardless of gender and age?

115
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35,333
He is staring at me.

116
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,125
Are you the duck
who came to get my seal previously?

117
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:52,875
I wonder why I'm very curious about you.

118
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,833
A duck got pinned to the wall.

119
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,708
What an incredible visual.

120
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,250
Why are you escaping?

121
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,583
Well, the entry will close soon.

122
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,750
Oh, right.

123
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:23,583
It's not bad to see Master Claude
enjoying a human's life.

124
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,875
It would be better if I could walk with him.

125
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,083
Red! Bad news!

126
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:36,208
The church seems like they are trying to get rid
of the demons in the academy no matter what.

127
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:40,333
They are planning to sneak Demon Snuff
into the arena to expose the demons.

128
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,542
I heard they've done something
to the lanterns at the venue's four corners.

129
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:49,375
The smell will cover the whole area
once the lanterns are lit.

130
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,583
However, if we retreated in an obvious manner,

131
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,042
the church will see us as traitors
and start to hunt us down.

132
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,500
The principal is participating
in the swordsmanship contest.

133
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,000
If the Demon Snuff awakens demons

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,917
and causes the principal
to turn into an evil dragon...

135
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,250
Not just the academy,

136
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,375
but the whole empire will be in danger.

137
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:16,875
We need to get Master Claude
to withdraw from the contest soon.

138
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:22,417
The Demon King cleared the preliminaries
without using magic and his dominant hand.

139
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:26,000
It should be easy for him to lose
when he has given himself such a big handicap.

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,958
My Master Claude will not lose that easily.

141
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,750
Think about it carefully.

142
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,375
Stop flaunting your relationship.

143
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,292
I do have a way.

144
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:36,083
Really?

145
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,375
A sleeping potion developed by Ruck.

146
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,042
It's very effective even on
Demon Kings and dragons.

147
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,958
Drugging him, right?

148
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,000
This is excellent water
drawn from a nearby well.

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,292
Please, have a drink.

150
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,750
I would love some.

151
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,792
Do your best in the finals.

152
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,708
Thank you.

153
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,375
Perhaps I'll rest for a bit.

154
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,167
If Master Claude is asleep,

155
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:28,000
he won't turn into a demon.
James won't turn into the final boss as well.

156
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,125
The Duchy of Mirchetta will be saved.

157
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,417
The Bad Ending will stay away from me!

158
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,542
Master Claude!

159
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,833
Master Claude!

160
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,042
It's time.

161
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,042
Serena. I'm not Claude right now.

162
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,458
I'm just an ordinary person, Claw.

163
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,792
What is this scenario?

164
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,917
The potion didn't work?

165
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:59,000
Excuse me. Did you eat my cookie?

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I did.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,958
How do you feel?

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,125
That girl...

169
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,792
Did she use an aphrodisiac

170
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,583
that affected the sleeping potion?

171
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,750
It's not bad.

172
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,625
Is that so?

173
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,917
In that case,
I'll have to pull out all the stops.

174
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,042
KYLE ELFORD
CV CHIAKI KOBAYASHI

175
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,500
ONE OF THE CHARACTERS THAT CAN BE TAMED
IN REGALIA OF SAINTS, DEMONS AND MAIDENS 2

176
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,667
SIMILAR TO WALT, HE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART
IN FIGHTING AGAINST THE DEMON.

177
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,875
GOOD AT FIGHTING. HE DEFEATED
A FEW PEOPLE IN THE MARTIAL ARTS CLASS.

178
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,000
Auguste from year one

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,750
will proceed to the finals!

180
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,833
The Demon King will be fighting as well, right?

181
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,667
Who will win?

182
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,208
It's definitely the Demon King.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Duck, it's you again?

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,417
What do you want this time?

185
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,583
YOUR FIANCEE IS NOT A DECENT WOMAN

186
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,458
SHE GOT ENGAGED TO TWO BROTHERS

187
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,875
HOW UNSEEMLY

188
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,708
PRINCE CEDRIC ABANDONED HER

189
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,208
BECAUSE SHE WAS TRASH

190
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,083
It has begun!

191
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,667
Demon King...

192
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,750
And a duck?

193
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,292
I thought you were just a weird duck

194
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,792
but turns out you are quite something.

195
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,292
I overdid it.

196
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,500
I just wanted to anger him a bit.

197
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,875
You humiliated my fiancee.

198
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,083
An apology is not enough to save you!

199
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,250
You don't have much strength.

200
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,708
I don't know if you are a man or a woman.

201
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,125
Who are you?

202
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,167
Whatever.

203
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,792
I just need to destroy your costume!

204
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,250
That's it.

205
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,792
I'll just get Master Claude
to destroy the lanterns.

206
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,875
Red!

207
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,000
Are you all right?

208
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,375
What's going on?

209
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,083
Is this a performance before the final match?

210
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,542
That's interesting!

211
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,292
Three against one.

212
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,042
The ducks are acting weirdly.

213
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,625
Aili. The people from the church
are trying to light the lantern.

214
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,333
Where are you looking at?

215
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,458
What is your purpose?

216
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,792
Did you humiliate Aileen purposely?

217
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,750
What's going on?

218
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,625
Auguste! Help us out!

219
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,167
How?

220
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:03,833
Say something like
the Demon King's fiancee is ugly!

221
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,833
You can't simply say that
even if it's the truth!

222
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,208
This is bad.

223
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,375
I did it.

224
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,833
However...

225
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,750
Are you all right?

226
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,083
What's going on with this commotion?

227
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,792
A performance before the final match.

228
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:05,917
It's to show everyone
the strength of the guard unit.

229
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,875
Principal, we are very sorry.

230
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:12,208
Was it also a show to call my fiancee ugly?

231
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,958
Especially that red one.

232
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,250
He humiliated my fiancee.

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,042
I won't be satisfied until I cut him down.

234
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,458
Besides, shouldn't you apologise

235
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,583
by showing your real face?

236
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,542
You are right.

237
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:35,833
Not good. This is terrible.

238
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,917
What are you doing, my foolish master?

239
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,333
Keith, have you returned?

240
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,042
That's right.

241
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:49,958
I flew over as soon as I heard
someone was having fun here.

242
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,917
Sire, we have returned
after we carried out your orders.

243
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,708
What is this mess?

244
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,042
I'm sure it's your fault!

245
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,625
I'm the one who broke them
but I didn't do it on purpose.

246
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,083
Do you think that excuse will work?

247
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,542
Don't be angry. I prepared souvenirs.

248
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,208
The church members who are lying there.

249
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,500
They seemed to have done something
to the lanterns.

250
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,083
Take it back and investigate it.

251
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,083
Did he notice the Demon Snuff?

252
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,042
When?

253
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:28,250
My master has troubled all of you.

254
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,917
I will keep a close eye on him so he
doesn't appear at the school festival anymore.

255
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,750
Then, the final...

256
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,500
You win.

257
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,917
I lost to you with my left hand.

258
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,292
So, you are the champion.

259
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,333
I am the champion?

260
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,500
Let's fight again next time.

261
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,042
As a friend.

262
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,458
Of course.

263
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,708
-Magic?
-It's my first time seeing it.

264
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,917
Amazing!

265
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,167
I'll leave the rest to you.

266
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,542
I'll be looking forward
to seeing your real face next time.

267
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,833
Hence, the first day
of the school festival ended in peace.

268
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Although the church has left the academy,

269
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,250
we still don't know
the true identity of Ashtart

270
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,167
"DAY 2 OF THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL"
and the source of Demon Snuff.

271
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,292
The prize for winning the title
of Princess Lily White is Demon Snuff?

272
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:35,000
That's right. Jasper said an anonymous letter
has been sent to the empire's news outlet.

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,125
Aili's secret organisation
has people in the newspaper as well?

274
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,000
That's amazing.

275
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,125
The ball comes after the swordsmanship contest?

276
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,500
We need to confirm the prize
as soon as possible...

277
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
We can't do that due to the security detail.

278
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,917
After all, the ball is in
the parents' council's jurisdiction.

279
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,208
What should we do then?

280
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,667
Excuse me,

281
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,167
can I participate in the contest?

282
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:04,125
We can get the prize
if I become Princess Lily White.

283
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,042
That's it!

284
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,833
Will you be fine?

285
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,792
Don't pass out once you're on the stage.

286
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,583
I can do it.

287
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,292
Everyone knows that Rachel is Serena's rival

288
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,667
so it should be fine.

289
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,708
It should work.

290
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,375
I have no objections.

291
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,500
Me too.

292
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,208
It'll have to do.

293
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,292
I'll be preparing my dress.

294
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:31,167
I sold my dress.

295
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,083
Don't worry. You can still make it.

296
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,958
Pick one with Isaac.

297
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,458
Why me?

298
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,042
I'll be depending on you.

299
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,333
Fine. Let's go.

300
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,792
Rachel.

301
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,667
Please wait!

302
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,292
I didn't expect Demon Snuff to be
the prize for Princess Lily White.

303
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,625
I don't remember this scenario in the game.

304
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,792
Sorry. Thanks for waiting.

305
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:09,542
Isaac told me this is just right.

306
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,833
It suits you a lot.

307
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,125
I will do my best.

308
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:20,333
I might not look it,
but I'm good at etiquette and social skills.

309
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,167
I'll change Isaac's opinion about me.

310
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,708
If you become Princess Lily White,

311
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,833
will you choose Isaac as your partner?

312
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,625
Why him?

313
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,625
When I wanted to break off my engagement,

314
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:42,042
my parents objected and
my fiance was very angry.

315
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:46,417
Many people blamed me
so I wondered if I had made the right choice.

316
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:49,542
Isaac told me something.

317
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,833
You did well.

318
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,542
I felt very proud then.

319
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,542
So, I'll also do my best this time.

320
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,417
I won't lose to Serena.

321
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:07,292
It felt the same as when I attended the ball.

322
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,917
Rachel.

323
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,125
Are you planning to enter
the Princess Lily White contest?

324
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,625
Yes. I changed my mind.

325
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,167
Is that so? Let's both do our best.

326
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,708
That is such a nice dress.

327
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,917
Show me.

328
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,125
Rachel!

329
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm fine...

330
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,583
Oh no, my dress!

331
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,917
Miss Serena fell down the stairs?

332
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,500
Her dress is ruined.

333
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,042
The contest will begin soon.

334
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,333
Did she do it on purpose?

335
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,417
All of you...

336
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,667
Master Aili.

337
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,500
Rachel.

338
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,333
Rachel, don't worry about it.

339
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,667
That was just an accident.

340
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll try to do something about the dress.

341
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,875
This woman...

342
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:02,042
How dare she bully my cute junior.

343
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,625
Let's have a fair contest.

344
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,500
What happened?

345
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,333
Are you all right?

346
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,667
I'm fine...

347
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:17,292
How can you dance when you can't even stand?

348
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:19,667
No way. I'll be fine.

349
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,583
Just give up on becoming Princess Lily White.

350
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,458
But...

351
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,375
Rachel, can you lend me the dress?

352
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,208
Is he serious?

353
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,792
Aili is so brave.

354
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,167
It might suit him surprisingly well.

355
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,750
No way.

356
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,625
Good evening, gentlemen.
