1
00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:06,250
I am a human. There's no need to follow me.

2
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:14,875
I have no other place to be
except by your side.

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:16,875
Is that so?

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
A dream?

5
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,458
Are you awake?

6
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:38,958
Miss Aileen!

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,250
Bel?

8
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,875
Why are you outside the barrier?

9
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,875
You should know the reason.

10
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:53,167
You've done something bad
behind Master Claude's back, right?

11
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,667
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

12
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:30,583
"THE VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER KEEPS THE LAST BOSS"
Ignoring funds being embezzled

13
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,667
amazed me.

14
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,875
So, after serious investigation...

15
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:39,833
You found out I have been selling demons.

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,000
This is... The contract to purchase the land?

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,167
How did you get this?

18
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,583
I got this document through my father.

19
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,042
After all, there's not much time left.

20
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,750
Time?

21
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,875
I'm sure you've heard about
the incident with Miss Lilia.

22
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:08,917
Even in human form, Master Claude
couldn't resist the power of the holy sword.

23
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:12,792
He will be easily defeated
when he turns into a demon.

24
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,792
According to the legend,

25
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,083
when the demon king
is shrouded by negative emotion,

26
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,083
he will awaken as a dragon

27
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,917
and become the Demon King.

28
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:27,917
What do you think
the humans have done for that to happen?

29
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,792
For example, the Demon King killing
his confidant after realising his betrayal.

30
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,917
Keith Eigrid.

31
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,333
He has been following
Master Claude since he was young.

32
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:49,333
Master Claude is my saviour.

33
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,000
When I was five years old,

34
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,917
I fell into a pond because of a prank.

35
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,042
I was just a follower.

36
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,125
It was fine to abandon me.

37
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,833
But he used magic in front of his servants

38
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,958
and saved my life.

39
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,458
Since then, people found out
he was the Demon King.

40
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,708
A few years later,
he was banished to the castle.

41
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:21,042
I don't want him to lose hope in the humans.

42
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:26,625
I believe he will one day live a happy life.

43
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,583
That's what I've been believing in.

44
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,042
However, the humans are just terrible.

45
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,625
What's the meaning of this?

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,125
You want us to leave the land we bought?

47
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:41,917
The signature on this document
wasn't signed by me.

48
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:45,750
Forging a document is a crime, Brat.

49
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:52,625
Well, I can turn a blind eye if you sell me
some demons that can make me some money.

50
00:04:56,292 --> 00:05:01,625
As a human, I have no choice.

51
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,792
Perhaps turning Master Claude into a demon
might be happier for him.

52
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:17,333
Master Keith. Your weakness
is that you have no human allies.

53
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,375
So,

54
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,333
let me be your ally.

55
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,667
SHARED ROUTE 6, SHARED ROUTE 7
CEDRIC ROUTE, MARCUS ROUTE"

56
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,208
What happens now is
a branching route in the game.

57
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,125
LILIA, NO WAY...

58
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,917
Miss Lilia and Lord Cedric are investigating
the illegal demon trade.

59
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,708
The first person they suspect is Master Keith.

60
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,792
"LILIA"
and inform Master Claude.

61
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,208
"MASTER KEITH IS SELLING THE DEMONS"
and inform Master Claude.

62
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,417
After that, when they go
to the place where the deal takes place,

63
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,958
they find Master Claude executing Keith.

64
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,375
Master Claude falls into despair
and turns into the evil dragon

65
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,375
and gets destroyed by the holy sword.

66
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,750
That's the ending.

67
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:07,458
He got destroyed just because
he was betrayed by his confidant!

68
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,625
What kind of script is that?

69
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,500
I won't accept it from the bottom of my heart!

70
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,167
Are you kidding me?

71
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,000
If we are really going to do that,
we need to think of a way.

72
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:23,500
If we can solve it,
we can increase Oberon Trading Firm's profit.

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,792
Besides, I have a trump card.

74
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,167
Trump card?

75
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,708
Hi! I am the trump card, Keith!

76
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,458
From today onwards,
I'll also be the slaves' companion.

77
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,875
Slaves...

78
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:42,417
The Demon King always
agrees with my request easily.

79
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,500
He is supposed to be a young master
who doesn't even know where the tea is.

80
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:50,500
Isn't this within the barrier?
The Demon King will hear it.

81
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,750
Everyone, let's start planning.

82
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,583
We need to frequently
share new information we gathered.

83
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:59,375
Enemy attack! Those people are back!

84
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,958
Those people? Don't tell me!

85
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,250
I told you to return.

86
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,958
Brother, it's no use threatening us.

87
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,083
Lilia is the Holy Sword Maiden.

88
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:19,542
Master Claude. Keith is doing an illegal trade
to exchange demons for money.

89
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,375
We are supposed to turn a blind eye
and continue the investigation

90
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,583
but Lilia...

91
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,375
All of you are overthinking.

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,792
Hello, Miss Aileen.

93
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,917
You are still as pretty as usual.

94
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:41,542
Miss Lilia. It's been a long time.

95
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:45,625
Have you forgotten the rule I've taught you

96
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,375
to address the person above you?

97
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:55,917
Are you talking about the demon trade?

98
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,083
That's right!

99
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,958
The trading of demons
is a violation of the pact.

100
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,500
That's not true.

101
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,208
No way.

102
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,083
Trading is a matter of ethics.

103
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:14,750
But... Don't you think the demons are pitiful?

104
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:22,042
Just go back and learn how to become an empress.

105
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,958
Miss Aileen...

106
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,583
You are so mean!

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,167
Lilia!

108
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,042
Lilia!

109
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,708
Master Claude.

110
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,375
I have something to report.

111
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,625
Say it.

112
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,042
Please wait for me...

113
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,875
To complete Miss Aileen's orders.

114
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,167
Then, I will give you a full report.

115
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:00,000
I can't continue my mistakes

116
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,625
because

117
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,667
I am your right-hand man.

118
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,917
All right.

119
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,542
Steel your resolve when the time has come.

120
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,958
That guy really has been
selling off his companions.

121
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:44,375
The demons are being sold willingly
for the Demon King's sake.

122
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:49,167
After Master Keith completes the deal,
he will also pressure the buyer.

123
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:54,000
I know that. I do know that.

124
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,625
What are you doing?

125
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:05,875
Actually, you can't see Master Keith
shouldering this burden all alone, right?

126
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,292
Enough. How long will you keep this going?

127
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,000
Until you've cheered up.

128
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,583
You can stop it now.

129
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,833
It's just like the game's event.

130
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,417
Miss Lilia and the rest
will be hiding in the woods.

131
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,792
They are not there?

132
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,625
These demons can fetch a good price.

133
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,500
Oh, Penne.

134
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,667
Did you sell the land
that you promised me to other people?

135
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,833
What are you talking about?

136
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:48,250
I was shocked when someone from
the Dautriche family showed me the contract.

137
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:56,667
All right. Just give me the ledger and leave.

138
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,542
Oh no! The ledger!

139
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,625
-Get it back!
-Don't run!

140
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,042
He's so strong.

141
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,500
Move according to the drill!

142
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,375
The demons have escaped!

143
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,750
Darn it!

144
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,583
Get the ledger back!

145
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,458
We'll be in trouble if it goes public!

146
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,458
We have to get it back
even if it means killing him!

147
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,125
Isaac, I'll live it to you.

148
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,750
Demons cannot attack humans.

149
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,500
This is the basic rule of the pact.

150
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,250
However, digging holes for fun

151
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,792
or dropping potions accidentally

152
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,500
should be fine.

153
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,125
My eyes!

154
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:10,292
Isaac, this is bordering
the non-aggression pact.

155
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,708
Well then, I'll hand over
these people to the knights.

156
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:22,125
Now, we'll be able to stop Master Claude
from awakening his Demon King's power.

157
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:27,333
However, why didn't Miss Lilia
appear in the forest?

158
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,375
Miss Aileen!

159
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,083
Master Keith?

160
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,333
Be obedient.

161
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,292
You...

162
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,167
I have the holy sword's power.

163
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,333
That thing is nothing!

164
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,542
No!

165
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,333
What?

166
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,333
What should I do?

167
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,042
I was only trying to stop him.

168
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,417
Belzebuth!

169
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,583
Aileen, are you happy now?

170
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,583
I'm going to make you my second wife.

171
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,542
Please wait!

172
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,500
Stop! Let her go!

173
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,833
Miss Aileen...

174
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,208
Is an important woman of the Demon King!

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,833
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

176
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,667
KEITH EIGRID
CV JUN FUKUYAMA

177
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,500
THE SECOND SON OF A FAMOUS BARON FAMILY
DEMON KING'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND, HUMAN.

178
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,333
HAS NATURAL LIGHT BROWN AND CURLY HAIR,
WEARS GLASSES, A DEPENDABLE YOUTH.

179
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,167
HE IS FOUND SELLING DEMONS
DURING THE CEDRIC ROUTE

180
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,083
AND GOT KILLED BY THE ENRAGED MASTER CLAUDE.

181
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,208
What's going on? What happened?

182
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:53,750
Miss Aileen has been abducted by Lord Cedric.

183
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:01,417
Master Claude. I used to betray you.

184
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:07,333
It was Miss Aileen who told me
the way to make amends.

185
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,625
However, I couldn't protect her.

186
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,875
Take care of Bel.

187
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,125
Also, I know where the tea is.

188
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,167
I just don't know how to make it.

189
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,083
What are you doing?

190
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,458
This is the only way

191
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,458
to get Father to approve this.

192
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,542
Are you trying to...

193
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,250
I don't want Lilia to hear this.

194
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,792
If I sleep with you,
you'll become my second wife.

195
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:03,292
I wonder how Brother will look
when he finds out about this.

196
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:10,042
I actually care about a man's gaze...

197
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:15,208
It's as if I've fallen in love.

198
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,375
Found her!

199
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,292
Demon King! Found her!

200
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,375
Is he here?

201
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,500
Master Claude. You came for me.

202
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,917
Brother!

203
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:04,458
You actually...

204
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,708
The Demon King's awakening event.

205
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,375
Did I become the key to triggering the event?

206
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,667
Lord Cedric!

207
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,125
Lilia! Bring out the sword!

208
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,000
He has turned into a demon
just like we expected.

209
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,750
Now, it's all over for Brother.

210
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,042
If Lilia kills the Demon King
who transformed into a dragon,

211
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,583
she will become the empress for real.

212
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,000
This is their goal.

213
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,208
What did you do to Aileen...

214
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,250
She is my...

215
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,375
Master Claude! Calm down!

216
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,292
Don't look...

217
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,208
Don't look at me.

218
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,125
I...

219
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,750
I...

220
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,583
I...

221
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,125
Master Claude!

222
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,542
How pitiful.

223
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,667
This is the only way.

224
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,208
I will put an end to your sorrow.

225
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,167
What are you thinking?

226
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,875
Even if the Holy Sword
has no effect on humans...

227
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,667
Are you sure it has no effects

228
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,375
when it hurts so much?

229
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:55,500
Sorry. I have the blood
of the holy sword maiden as well.

230
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,875
I won't let you kill Master Claude!

231
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,500
I'm going to take the holy sword for myself!

232
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,375
No way! How is that possible...

233
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,833
I'm sorry to say

234
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,917
that you are not the protagonist.

235
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,500
I am!

236
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,125
Master Claude.

237
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,958
You look handsome in this.

238
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,333
I don't mind keeping you

239
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,000
even if you look like this.

240
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,417
However... living our lives

241
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,167
as a couple... will be difficult.

242
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,792
You really made me cry.

243
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:54,375
You need to be responsible for that.

244
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,333
If you love me, come back to me.

245
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,125
This is an ending
that doesn't exist in the game.

246
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,833
A life of happiness
where demons and humans coexist

247
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,292
will surely come true.

248
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,167
The doctor said she was just exhausted.

249
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,500
I see.

250
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,375
Aileen has promised
not to expose Cedric's act of violence

251
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,500
on the condition
that he returns the throne to you.

252
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,167
I have no interest in the throne.

253
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,625
This child has been receiving
the education to become an empress since young.

254
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,042
She is also working hard.

255
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,708
Perhaps I'm a father who loves his daughter

256
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,000
but she is really my precious child.

257
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,625
She is only planning
to marry the person who becomes king.

258
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:18,417
Is that so? I'll become the king then.

259
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,208
They are here.

260
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,292
Claude Jeanne Elmir

261
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:42,292
has been appointed as the empire's crown prince.

262
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,250
Aileen Lauren Dautriche,

263
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,375
as the crown princess-elect,

264
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,833
you will be engaged with Crown Prince Claude.

265
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,333
I accept.

266
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,625
Second Prince Cedric.

267
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,292
Please do your best to support Master Claude.

268
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,417
Aileen.

269
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,292
-Magic!
-It's so amazing!

270
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,000
Everyone is watching.

271
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,125
I like your reaction.

272
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,042
You may escape from me if you don't like it.

273
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,417
Escape?

274
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,417
What are you talking about?

275
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,125
You have been caught by me.

276
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,382
I will never let you escape!

277
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:44,375
Life is so interesting.

278
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:47,875
No matter what difficulties
I face in the future,

279
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,208
I will definitely trample over it.

280
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,083
That's right.

281
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,958
The game of Aileen Lauren Dautriche

282
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,625
is still far from over.
