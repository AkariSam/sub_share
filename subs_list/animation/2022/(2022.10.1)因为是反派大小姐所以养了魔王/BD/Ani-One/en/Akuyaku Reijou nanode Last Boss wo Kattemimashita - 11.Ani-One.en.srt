1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,708
If I've been causing you trouble, I will leave!

2
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,583
I'M THE VILLAINESS, SO I'M TAMING THE FINAL BOSS!

3
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,625
"THE VILLAINESS IS ALWAYS CONDEMNED"
Are you... Belzebuth?

4
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,208
Are you... Belzebuth?

5
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,500
Demon King, are you calling my name?

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,750
I am Keith, Master.

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,375
Oh, this won't do.

8
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,708
The cushion is not positioned correctly.

9
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,750
This tea is not right, too.

10
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,417
I'll make you your usual tea.

11
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:35,667
Are you going to
break off the engagement with Aileen?

12
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,708
Just do what you want.

13
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,000
However, if Aileen goes missing,
it would be a problem.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,417
I don't recall teaching you
to hurt women like that.

15
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,458
It's not true.

16
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,458
I just hope
that she doesn't come near me anymore.

17
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:57,167
However, it was conveyed
to the demons wrongly, right?

18
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,750
Master. What were you thinking?

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,875
Bel!

20
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,167
There's poison on the shelf. I'm disinfecting it.

21
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,583
Darn humans.

22
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:14,083
Can you think it through before acting?

23
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,583
Who cares?

24
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,458
Bel. Put out the fire.

25
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,958
Demon King.

26
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,208
Your orders, please.

27
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,042
Bring her...

28
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:35,250
Bring Aileen Lauren Dautriche to the ball.

29
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:45,542
Are you serious about not going to the ball?

30
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,083
I can work for a living.

31
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,458
As long as the engagement is broken off,
I won't be punished.

32
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,042
I can survive being cut off from the family.

33
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,625
Shouldn't you leave the Demon King's Castle
as soon as possible then?

34
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,417
But, Almond and the rest will cry.

35
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,625
They even danced the
"Please Don't Leave Me" dance for me.

36
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,875
Miss Aileen! You have a package.

37
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,292
This is...

38
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:17,333
Your gown for the ball the day after tomorrow.

39
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:19,667
What does this mean?

40
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,083
Master has said

41
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,792
to have Aileen put this on at the ball.

42
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,250
Aileen.

43
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,917
Saying all this now...

44
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,375
I won't go.

45
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:41,000
He even ordered us to take you there
even if you cried, screamed or risked execution.

46
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,417
Even after losing his memory,
my Master didn't change.

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,458
He will not give up easily
on the things he likes.

48
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,500
Things he likes... Why?

49
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,042
I slapped him.

50
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:59,500
Demon King must be in love with Miss Aileen.

51
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,792
I... I will never go.

52
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,750
Don't decide so quickly.

53
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,458
Aileen. Here.

54
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,667
Demon King is calling. Dance.

55
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,875
Isaac.

56
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:38,583
Just accept your fate.

57
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,542
He was so cold to me when I seduced him.

58
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,833
When I've decided to give up,
he came after me again.

59
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,167
I understand that men are hunters by nature,

60
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,917
but this is absolutely unforgivable.

61
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,167
I have my principles too.

62
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,500
Master Claude.

63
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,958
I'll make you...

64
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,542
Regret inviting me to the ball.

65
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,417
Why?

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,625
Why is it a duck?

67
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,292
It's because you ordered me to put on this dress

68
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,542
but you didn't order me to show my face.

69
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,333
Why are you resisting?

70
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,500
This is the most recent trend, duck style.

71
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,250
Impossible.

72
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,000
Take it off.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,500
No! I can't face Master Claude.

74
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,792
Master Claude!

75
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,792
That's just plain stupid!

76
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,384
I don't want to be called stupid
by a woman with a duck head.

77
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,125
Make way.

78
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,792
Why did you take me here?

79
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,958
Can I hug you?

80
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,500
There's a limit to this.

81
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,333
I'm about to get angry.

82
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,583
I think I've figured out
the strength to hold you.

83
00:07:54,417 --> 00:08:00,208
Keith said,
get close to your face and say your name.

84
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,417
What did he teach you?

85
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,125
What's good doing...

86
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,167
Aileen.

87
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,208
Aileen.

88
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:17,750
I see. Even though you sound tough,
you're not used to men's sweet words.

89
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,458
It seems like I've been fooled.

90
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,958
That's not true.

91
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,958
I... I...

92
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,417
Shall we do it again?

93
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,125
That's so shameless!

94
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,875
Who'd do this before marriage...

95
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,167
Aileen.

96
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,375
I... Love you...

97
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,125
Love me... You love me...

98
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,208
Yes. I love you.

99
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,542
I want to make you cry,
comfort you, and spoil you rotten even.

100
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,083
Are you doing this even after losing memory?

101
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:54,500
Whether I've lost my memory
does not change my love for you.

102
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,167
This must be fate.

103
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:01,250
Do you think you'll be forgiven
if you say that now?

104
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,583
Yes.

105
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,125
I really want to cut you down.

106
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,583
If you can't forgive me as is,
then I have an idea.

107
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,500
Aileen.

108
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:15,875
You can do anything to me.
Hit my face or anywhere

109
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,958
until you feel better.

110
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,792
As if I could!

111
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:24,208
Is that so? What a pity.

112
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,583
I was looking forward to what you'd do to me.

113
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:32,083
Are you aware that your behaviour now
is the complete opposite from before?

114
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,500
Love changes a person.

115
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,333
Do you think saying that in a cool way
would make me...

116
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,042
All right. I'll forgive you...

117
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,917
Then, let's go.

118
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,542
We'll have a dance to announce our relationship.

119
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,500
You should head back first.

120
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,333
I... I need to fix my makeup.

121
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,708
You're already very beautiful.

122
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,875
I don't want to leave you.

123
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,625
No way.

124
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,958
I'd rather look like a duck

125
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,333
than dance with you like this.

126
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,375
I understand.

127
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,875
I'll return to the venue first.

128
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,833
As expected of Miss Aileen.

129
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,125
Master Claude fell in love with you again
after a slap.

130
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,792
Is... Is that so?

131
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,833
I'll get you the lipstick to match this dress.

132
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,500
Please wait for me.

133
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:40,083
Master Claude said he loves me.

134
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,542
You look happy.

135
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,167
Miss Aileen.

136
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,333
BELZEBUTH, CV YUKI ONO
ONE OF THE DEMON KING'S FOLLOWERS

137
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,375
HAS LONG HAIR AND PORCELAIN-LIKE BEAUTY.

138
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,375
LOYAL TO DEMON KING CLAUDE
AND OBEYS TO THE DEMON KING'S ORDERS.

139
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,417
A SUPREME DEMON THAT HAS THE ABILITY
TO CONTROL OTHER DEMONS.

140
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,583
Elephas. What are you trying to do?

141
00:10:55,583 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't believe in love,
So I wasn't expecting things to head this way.

142
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:04,792
If this continues,
Demon King might regain his memories.

143
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,500
That would be a problem.

144
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,833
In the game, Elephas is the one
who helps Demon King regain his memories.

145
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,000
This setting had me careless.

146
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,875
You're a charming lord.

147
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,542
I wish I had met you before her.

148
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:31,458
Then, who is your master who is comparable to me?

149
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,625
She's a monstrous woman.

150
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,375
It seems like I have to rescue you from prison.

151
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,458
It's useless.

152
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,917
Almond?

153
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,542
Don't worry. It's still alive.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,250
How despicable!
How dare you take the demon creatures hostage?

155
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,750
They're innocent, foolish creatures.

156
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,750
They didn't even doubt me.

157
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:02,833
Next, we'll have our actors
continue with the play.

158
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,000
Actors?

159
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,792
Master Leister. Over here.

160
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,417
Miss Aileen has Demon Snuff on her.

161
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,208
Miss Aileen, what a shame.

162
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,333
Seems like it's just a farce.

163
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,917
What?

164
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,458
What is happening?

165
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,042
Leister. What is happening?

166
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,292
I can't reveal the details

167
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,208
but she intends to summon demons
to attack the place.

168
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,875
Demons?

169
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,250
No way.

170
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,625
She intends to reinstall the Crown Prince
as Demon King

171
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:57,125
and have demons rule this country.

172
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,792
That's horrible.

173
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,333
Pierre. Let's execute her here at once.

174
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,667
That's right. It cannot be pardoned.

175
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,375
There are other problems too.

176
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,208
During her time
as the fiancee of the Crown Prince,

177
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,042
she had relationships with other men.

178
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,542
What did you say?

179
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,875
All right. If you appreciate the crow's life,

180
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,292
then don't tell Master Claude the truth.

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,292
Master Claude. You must know this man.

182
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:31,292
He seemed to have had a night with Aileen.

183
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,708
Master Claude. I'm sorry.

184
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:41,750
I... No. We betrayed you.

185
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,083
Did you say we...

186
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,667
What are you saying?

187
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,375
Elephas. You...

188
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,542
Calm down.

189
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,125
You can punish me however you like

190
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,958
but please don't punish Miss Aileen.

191
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,542
Nonsense!

192
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,042
Master Claude. Don't listen to them.

193
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,958
Miss Aileen.

194
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,375
You said you were lonely
and you wanted me to comfort you.

195
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,125
You said you could only rely on me.

196
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,583
Were those words merely lies?

197
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,083
Enough!

198
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,625
Tell me you love me.

199
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,292
Then, I'll believe you.

200
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:27,750
I should have told him I love him just now.

201
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,125
Silly.

202
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,000
What?

203
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,875
I've been holding back for a long time

204
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,083
since you're the Crown Prince.

205
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,708
However, I've reached my limit.

206
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,917
I feel disgusted being loved by you.

207
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,292
What do you mean?

208
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,375
This is only natural.

209
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:59,625
I'm a human being. How can I have feelings...

210
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,750
For a Demon King.

211
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:08,042
You don't know who you truly are, right?

212
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,375
You... freak...

213
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,458
That's not true.

214
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,417
Not true, Demon King. Miss Aileen. Lied.

215
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,375
She purposely told a lie...

216
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,417
Don't disturb.

217
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,625
No way...

218
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,958
This is not true...

219
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,708
Almond.

220
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,250
Master Claude, please stop!

221
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:05,792
Aileen.

222
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,625
Master Claude. Did you regain your memories?

223
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,333
Kill her now.

224
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,208
She's a traitor
who wants to turn my son into a demon.

225
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes!

226
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:25,375
And the demons in the forest.
Send the Holy Knights and the troops

227
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,250
to kill them all!

228
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,667
Wait!

229
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:31,792
Master Claude!

230
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,833
No. Run now.

231
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,083
But.

232
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,292
Miss Aileen.

233
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:40,583
Elephas, kill the little girl!

234
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,917
Run. Aileen...

235
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,708
Before I return, the demons will...

236
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,917
Master Claude!

237
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,375
Aileen!

238
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:06,750
Aileen. It's the Demon King.

239
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,125
At that moment, I felt the Demon King's presence.

240
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,083
But, it's strange.

241
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,417
Almond's presence is gone.

242
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,500
Almond is with Master Claude

243
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,250
so it should be fine.

244
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,042
The Holy Knights are coming shortly.

245
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:28,375
There's no time to waste.

246
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,083
Aileen. Pull yourself together.

247
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,208
You want to be the Demon King's wife, don't you?

248
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,958
Isaac. Is there a way
for all the demons to get away?

249
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,208
Of course.

250
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,750
Underground labyrinth.

251
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,771
Yes. We'll be able to move freely between
the castle and the outskirts of the capital.

252
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:53,292
There are supplies in there too.
It should be enough for half a year.

253
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:57,042
Leave it to Doni.
The giant moles must be thrilled.

254
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,167
That's right. Moreover,
according to Belzebuth's instructions,

255
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,917
I even made it look creepy.

256
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,750
I wasn't expecting you all
to build an underground labyrinth.

257
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,792
All right, everyone.

258
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:19,792
I believe you must be feeling uneasy
without the Demon King here.

259
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:23,375
But from now on,
I'll take over Master's duties temporarily.

260
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,833
Some of you may still be confused.

261
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:35,958
The Demon King has bestowed upon me
the authority to enforce orders on everyone.

262
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,208
Is that so?

263
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:43,292
Yes. It's magic that activates
when something happens to Master Claude.

264
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,083
It's called "Demon King's Deputy".

265
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,292
Everyone. Leave the Demon King's Castle.

266
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:58,208
Stay as far away as you can
from the human capital.

267
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,125
Amazing.

268
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,792
Don't forget.
I'm the right-hand man to Master Claude.

269
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,125
So, you've become the Demon King again.

270
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,708
You're just a supporting character.
Aileen is the protagonist.

271
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,833
What are you saying?

272
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:38,000
It's still a surprise
that there's a character that I can't tame.

273
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,667
I'm a little amazed by it.

274
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,292
No wonder Aileen chose you.

275
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:45,042
So, Master Claude.

276
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,667
I will turn you into a princess
waiting to be saved.

277
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:02,583
The one who stole my memories... Was it you?

278
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,250
It's a secret.

279
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,333
It's not good to spoil the story.

280
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,833
I never thought we'd have to clear the dungeon.

281
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:28,333
Are the rest of them
who left early with Keith all right?

282
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,542
Don't worry. They should be here to welcome us.

283
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Everyone. Do you know
where the point of assembly is?

284
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,708
If anything happens, that is where...

285
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,375
Order! Order!

286
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,833
Knights are here!

287
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,917
Get ready!

288
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,125
This is bad. This will...

289
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,125
I'll stay and be the decoy.

290
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,750
I'll be Aileen's decoy and they'll come after me.

291
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,125
No way. You have to run with me.

292
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,958
Aileen, please meet with the demons.

293
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,417
But...

294
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,792
Isaac.

295
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:08,875
I'll leave it to you.

296
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,083
Isaac!

297
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,792
Don't worry. We will protect her.

298
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,750
I'll go too.

299
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,000
I can speak with the demons.
It'll be easier if I am there.

300
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,500
It'll be fine, Ribbon.

301
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,708
All of you...

302
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,333
Could it be...

303
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,042
Elephas.

304
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,375
Riding on such a big demon

305
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,625
makes it easy for me to find you.

306
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,875
Don't move, all of you.

307
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,917
I'll drop you to your death.

308
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,208
All right. Go back to the castle with me.

309
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,000
To hell with it.

310
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,042
On its own, the Sacred Sword is...
