1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:10,417
There are many crows today.

2
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,250
That was close.

3
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,625
But I completed my mission.
The reward is apple pie.

4
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:58,667
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

5
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,917
THE VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER HAS
A STRONG DESIRE SO SHE HAS TO WIN

6
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,750
Where is Aileen?

7
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,583
The Young Lady is making preparations.

8
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,625
How unusual it is
for her to prepare for so long.

9
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,792
Father, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

10
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,375
How shocking.

11
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,542
I'm seeing you in a different light, Aileen.

12
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,667
Does it look nice? Am I dressed nicely?

13
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:28,833
What's wrong with you?

14
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,792
You didn't even say that
when you made your society debut.

15
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,125
That's because...

16
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:44,417
A dress and a pair of shoes for the banquet

17
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:47,042
along with a set of accessories.

18
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,250
Claude Jeanne Elmir.

19
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,958
The makeup, hairstyle and perfume
have to be changed to match the outfit!

20
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,667
Here I am.

21
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,542
You look prettier than usual.

22
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,625
It's Miss Aileen.

23
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,625
So pretty.

24
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,458
-I can't help but envy.
-As expected of Miss Aileen.

25
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,708
Master Claude picked this dress, right?

26
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,208
He wanted me to wear to this banquet, right?

27
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:23,500
Lord Cedric might fall for you once again.

28
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,583
Stop joking. I'd reject him even if it kills me.

29
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,167
Is that so? I think it's possible.

30
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:35,292
After all, we haven't milked him
for the Dautriche family's losses.

31
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't worry about that.

32
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,167
Are you using
Oberon Trading Firm's beauty solution too?

33
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,417
Yes. I only use their beauty solution nowadays.

34
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm really thankful to Oberon Trading Firm.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,042
Oberon Trading Firm.
A company I've never heard about.

36
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:03,167
I had an acquaintance of mine
work hard and operate the firm.

37
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:07,333
We can't be using
the Dautriche name everywhere, right?

38
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,000
What a pity.
The sample was finished after a while.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,375
A sample? Why didn't I receive it?

40
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,208
Only a chosen few have received it.

41
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,750
Do anyone of you know
about Oberon Trading Firm's connections?

42
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,250
None of you?

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,375
They can't take it
when they know their rivals received it.

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,417
No wonder it's a success.

45
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:34,083
Yes. The marketing strategy was a success using
the noblewomen's conflicting relationships.

46
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,667
This is exceeding my expectations.

47
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,875
The architect who was fired my Lord Cedric

48
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,917
is also working now.

49
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:45,375
We'll soon be able to turn over our losses
and make a profit.

50
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,750
An ordinary man is not worthy of you indeed.

51
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,625
This is as far as I'll accompany you.

52
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,917
I'm looking forward to your performance.

53
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,750
Father is in a good mood.

54
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,917
Is something bad going to happen?

55
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,708
The reviews of the cosmetics
are excellent as we initially expected.

56
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,958
That's because they are products
that Ruck and Quartz have confidence in.

57
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,167
Has the issue regarding the
threatening letter been dealt with?

58
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:24,042
It's all thanks to Almond.
The culprit is also the person you expected.

59
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,250
I have proof.

60
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,167
Signal me when you need it.

61
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,125
As expected from Isaac.

62
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,125
It's reassuring to have a dependable classmate.

63
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,792
I have a bit of bad news.

64
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,458
Miss Lilia has gone missing.

65
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:43,167
"THREATENING LETTER"
It's the same as the threatening letter event.

66
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:47,917
I hired someone to kidnap her in the game.

67
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:53,833
Prince Cedric had Marcus leading
apprentice knights to the Demon King Forest.

68
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,125
Are Master Claude and the demons all right?

69
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,542
Calm down.

70
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,458
The Demon King will not be defeated that easily.

71
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,042
Besides, there's also the non-aggression pact.

72
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,833
But...

73
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:09,292
Demon King asked me
to do him a favour through Almond.

74
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,542
I'll leave Aileen in your care
before I get there.

75
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,375
You'll be fine, right?

76
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,625
After all, you are the woman
who won over the Demon King's heart.

77
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,750
You need to deal with
Master Claude's issue in secret.

78
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,333
Don't mind me. I'll leave that to you.

79
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:36,667
I would've taken you if no one wants you.

80
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,750
I'll never be so wasteful
and make you my husband.

81
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:42,583
You're really good with words.

82
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,417
If this goes on,

83
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,667
I'll become the kidnapper just like in the game.

84
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:03,000
But, I will overturn this.

85
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,917
I lost the first time.

86
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,625
I must win the second time.

87
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,417
Arrest Aileen Lauren Dautriche!

88
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,333
There's no castle repair work today.

89
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,167
I need to patrol like a knight.

90
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:32,750
Excuse me...

91
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,708
Cedric chose this girl over Aileen?

92
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,958
I'm Lilia Rainworth.

93
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,667
Do you still remember me?

94
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,667
How did you enter the barrier
without my knowledge?

95
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,667
Barrier? What are you talking about?

96
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,125
She has strong magic resistance.

97
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,792
Is she related to the Holy Sword Maiden?

98
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,042
Whatever. Just go home.

99
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,667
Please wait.

100
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:12,000
I have always been thinking about you,
Master Claude.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,667
You are living in a forest surrounded by demons

102
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:18,500
yet you still do your best
to stop the demons from disturbing the humans

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,833
but they just take it for granted.

104
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,792
That's sad.

105
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,917
You're so pitiful being alone out here.

106
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,083
Pitiful?

107
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:37,000
But the soldiers of the empire
seem to be surrounding this forest.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,417
You've misunderstood.

109
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,333
The soldiers are Lord Cedric's...

110
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,625
They are worried about me
because of the threatening letters...

111
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,917
You are the culprit
who sent the threatening letters, right?

112
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,958
You knew?

113
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,000
I had to do that to stop Miss Aileen.

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,250
Stop?

115
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,667
Miss Aileen is planning to
hire someone and kidnap me.

116
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,083
So, before she commits the crime...

117
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,750
You planned to hide, right?

118
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
Yes.

119
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,167
I came here to tell you
that I know about her plan.

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,958
Because you seem close to Miss Aileen.

121
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:25,083
I wished I had informed you earlier.

122
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,542
Sorry.

123
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:31,750
You sounded like you are sure
Aileen will be harming you.

124
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,208
Because Miss Aileen really loves Lord Cedric.

125
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,958
It's normal for her to hate me.

126
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,375
Besides...

127
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,958
I can't just leave you alone.

128
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,083
I want to meet you again
and have another talk with you.

129
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:55,750
Master Claude?

130
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,375
What's going on?
My head hurts until it feels numb.

131
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,917
Girl! What have you done to him?

132
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,292
This is...

133
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,250
The power of Holy Sword Maiden?

134
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,458
Don't touch her, Belzebuth!

135
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:28,125
Master Claude, I just want to be close to you.

136
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,500
I can fulfil your wish.

137
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,583
Aileen is also quite cute.

138
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,625
She actually lost to a girl like you?

139
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,417
However, when I recall
Cedric to be the cause of this,

140
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,792
it makes me feel unpleasant.

141
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,708
I've lost interest.

142
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,042
Get lost. I'm busy.

143
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,000
Wait!

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Please wait!

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,958
I'm doing this for your sake...

146
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,292
Bel. Are you all right?

147
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,708
I'm fine.

148
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,375
Let's go. We are going to be late.

149
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,583
What's going on?

150
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,667
I'm an invited guest, right?

151
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:26,250
How shameless. Lilia went missing
and you are the culprit, right?

152
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,042
You wrote the threatening letters, right?

153
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,250
Tell me! Where is Lilia?

154
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,375
I don't know where Miss Lilia is
and don't know anything about the letters.

155
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,208
Do you have proof that I did it?

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,542
There's no one else besides you.

157
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,750
You accused me without any proof.

158
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,667
Why did I fall for a man like you in the past?

159
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,875
Stop talking nonsense!

160
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,792
Lilia is a nuisance to you
because you wanted to reconcile with me.

161
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,208
I will never reconcile with you
even if it kills me.

162
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,417
Stop lying!

163
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,667
You said you admired me!

164
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,958
Lord Cedric.

165
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,167
I used to admire you.

166
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:12,292
I said I used to admire you. Past tense.

167
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,542
I no longer love you.

168
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,792
I don't have lingering feelings for you
and I want nothing to do with you.

169
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,292
I'm dying to end our engagement.

170
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,792
Just let me sign the document.

171
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,583
This is bad. She provoked him too much.

172
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,792
Impossible.

173
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,377
Tell me honestly. You did all of these

174
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,667
because you can't forget me.

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,333
Admit it!

176
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,125
-If you admit it honestly, I'll show you mercy.
-Even if he's the prince...

177
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,000
-Bow your head to me!
-Should we stop him?

178
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,792
Lord Cedric.

179
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:52,042
Don't be violent to a lady...

180
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:55,292
Shut up! She is my woman!

181
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,875
Excuse me!

182
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,708
Prince Cedric, I have a report!

183
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,167
Save it for later! I'm busy!

184
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,792
But...

185
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,167
Prince Claude is...

186
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,917
This is...

187
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,042
Brother...

188
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:46,875
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

189
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,708
CEDRIC JEANNE ELMIR
CV TOSHIKI MASUDA

190
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,542
THE VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER, AILEEN'S FORMER FIANCE
ELMIR EMPIRE'S SECOND PRINCE

191
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,375
A HIGH PARAMETER IS REQUIRED TO CONQUER HIM

192
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,208
BROKE OFF HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH AILEEN
AT THE BANQUET

193
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,042
AFTER THE ACADEMY'S WINTER SEMESTER.
CLAUDE'S HALF BROTHER

194
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,458
It's back to the way it was.

195
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,125
Is that the Demon King?

196
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,875
The power of magic.

197
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,375
It's my first time seeing that.

198
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:17,208
Cedric, did you send soldiers to the forest?

199
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,917
That's...

200
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,167
Are you trying to conquer my castle
with those soldiers?

201
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,583
You must be dreaming.

202
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,250
You're the crown prince.
I suggest you not do anything reckless.

203
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,542
Or are you trying to give me an excuse
to destroy the empire?

204
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,375
I've made you wait.

205
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,542
Sorry.

206
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,292
No. I haven't been waiting for a long time.

207
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:46,208
This dress suits you.

208
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,083
Aileen...

209
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,917
Are you...

210
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,667
Have you signed the document?

211
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,333
Not yet.

212
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,375
Hurry up and sign it.

213
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,833
I don't want to become
my brother's fiancee's escort.

214
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,333
Wait, Aileen!

215
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:09,000
Did you really not kidnap Lilia?

216
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,250
I've said so many times.

217
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,917
Then... Who would...

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,083
No matter how hard I work,
my brothers are always better than me.

219
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,917
Is that so?

220
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:33,708
Everyone is laughing at me behind my back.

221
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,750
The hardship of being compared
to his older brothers.

222
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,542
The same as me.

223
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:46,833
I wished I had told him back then
that I was on his side.

224
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,125
Isaac.

225
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,208
These are the threatening letters
sent to Miss Lilia.

226
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,333
I gathered the letters thrown in the garbage.

227
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,208
So what?

228
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,625
The threatening letters
used Lombard Company's papers.

229
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,542
There are 20 papers in a set.

230
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:15,542
The rose pattern is punched
after the whole set is stacked.

231
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:19,208
So, if you overlap the papers,

232
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,333
the same set of papers
will have a matching hole.

233
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,625
Papers from another set
will not have a matching hole.

234
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,792
This paper is a letter

235
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:33,458
given to me by Miss Lilia
together with the banquet invitation.

236
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,667
They come from the same set of papers.

237
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,542
That means

238
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:49,125
Miss Lilia's letter and the threatening letters

239
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,833
come from the same set of paper.

240
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,250
I'm giving it to you.

241
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,583
After all, it has nothing to do with me.

242
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,250
Lord Cedric, I wish you well.

243
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,750
I wish you happiness with Miss Lilia.

244
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,500
When I was young,

245
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,958
I obtained a bit of confidence
and courage from you.

246
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,925
So, I worked hard.

247
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,000
As a result, I lost many things

248
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,250
and had many encounters as well.

249
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,333
Lord Cedric and I

250
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,083
might be engaged but we were not lovers.

251
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,000
However, I think we are comrades at least.

252
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,500
Farewell, Lord Cedric.

253
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:19,583
Lady Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

254
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,167
I hope you can grant me your first dance

255
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,458
after you regain your freedom.

256
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,125
She chose my brother over me?

257
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:50,583
You betrayed me. Don't think I'll forgive you.

258
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,333
Thank you for today.

259
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,375
I believe the kidnapping issue is over now.

260
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,333
Although Lord Cedric's
engagement announcement was cancelled,

261
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,958
at least Miss Lilia has been found.

262
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,042
You helped her, right?

263
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:14,875
What?

264
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,500
I heard Miss Lilia was lost in the forest.

265
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,833
-She was lying on the ground crying.
-Where is this place?

266
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,708
Miss Lilia

267
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,417
is cute, right?

268
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,083
Oh no, I'm not planning to say this.

269
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,625
She is very popular

270
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,792
and her smile is therapeutic.

271
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,333
She has smooth skin

272
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,917
and silky hair.

273
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,708
-What should I do? I can't stop.
-She is good at cooking, sewing,

274
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,292
and also a bold girl.

275
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,542
Aileen.

276
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,667
What are you afraid of?

277
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:54,375
Miss Lilia is the heroine.

278
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,500
By having a conversation with her
and tripping a flag,

279
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,875
you'll know that she...

280
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,958
It hurts.

281
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,583
It hurts.

282
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,458
They stretch surprisingly well.

283
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,375
What are you doing?

284
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,958
Don't worry. You are cute too.

285
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,250
Besides, she's not my type.

286
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,667
Is... Is that so?

287
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:24,375
Did Miss Lilia tell you anything?

288
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,083
What did she tell me?

289
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,500
Something like fulfilling my wish.

290
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:35,125
Your wish is to not give up
on both the demons and humans, right?

291
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,792
Because I saw you happily
watching the demons working with Doni.

292
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,667
It is also my wish to see you cry.

293
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,750
I reject to fulfil that wish.

294
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,083
Is that so? What a pity.

295
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,625
Go back and rest. You must be tired.

296
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,208
Yes. I shall...

297
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I promised you to become the perfect escort.

298
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,917
This isn't like me.

299
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:12,083
It's just a greeting. A goodbye kiss.

300
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,083
Fall!

301
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,917
Fall to your doom!

302
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:28,083
The humans I want to protect

303
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,750
no longer exist.

304
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,250
Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

305
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,667
Goodnight.

306
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
I remember now.

307
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:54,625
The reason why he lost faith in humans

308
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,625
was because he was betrayed.

309
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:04,750
By a human he trusted since young.
