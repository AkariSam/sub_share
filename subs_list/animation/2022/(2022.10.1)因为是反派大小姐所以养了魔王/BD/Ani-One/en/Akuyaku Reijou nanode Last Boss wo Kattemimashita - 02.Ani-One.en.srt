1
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,375
Aileen.

2
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:09,500
Your pharmaceutical company
and the construction enterprise

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,792
will be taken over by Lord Cedric.

4
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:16,625
Isn't that theft?

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,333
You made a mistake
when signing that contract, Aileen.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,167
You caused a huge loss for the Dautriche family.

7
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,667
I'm very sorry.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:31,792
You have to make up
for the loss before the banquet.

9
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,875
There are only two months to go.

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,125
I don't want my daughter
to do nothing at home every day.

11
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,792
Do your best.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,792
Father is serious.

13
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,833
If this goes on, I'll be disowned.

14
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:16,667
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

15
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:19,750
"THE VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER HAS MANY ENEMIES"
Anyway,

16
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,792
"AND ALSO MANY SUBORDINATES"
I have to make up for the losses

17
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,583
caused by Lord Cedric acquiring my business.

18
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,500
-Miss Aileen.
-Jasper.

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,792
Good day.

20
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,875
How can you be so relaxed?

21
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,000
Has your engagement really been terminated?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,167
It's true.

23
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,958
Sorry, I won't agree to an interview.

24
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,792
I have no intention to interview you.

25
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,083
I'm in your debt anyway.

26
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,292
Besides, our newspaper is on justice's side.

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,250
Still, that was a despicable move.

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,792
After all you did for Prince Cedric...

29
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,500
Oh. I have a request for you.

30
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,500
That's about it.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,125
Using my allowance

32
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,250
to repair this castle.

33
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,417
That means...

34
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:12,167
Are humans going to come inside the castle?

35
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,833
Child, you are being disrespectful!

36
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:17,625
I think it's disrespectful to let
a king stay in a castle like this.

37
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,625
Don't you know how great this castle is?

38
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,375
Humans are really...

39
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,667
In my previous life,
this person will be deemed delusional.

40
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:30,208
Master Claude, think of this as helping others.

41
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,875
Helping others? What do you mean?

42
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,625
Actually,

43
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:40,833
I want the people who were dismissed for
no reason by Lord Cedric to repair this castle.

44
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:45,458
You are a baron's daughter.
Why are you doing this?

45
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,625
Of course, it is to help people.

46
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,083
I know you will reject it. But...

47
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,458
I'll leave it to you then.

48
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,208
Is that possible?

49
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,833
Keith, aren't your salary and my grand overdue?

50
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,083
Yes.

51
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,375
Perhaps a certain noble
is involved in embezzlement.

52
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,500
Investigate it in detail
and get the funding we deserve

53
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,500
to use as the repair payments.

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,833
Just leave it to me.

55
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,958
Excuse me.

56
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,250
Regarding the funds,

57
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,083
I've asked a reporter
who's an acquaintance of mine to look into it.

58
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,542
You've taken action already?

59
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,875
I think doing this is the best method for us.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,625
It feels like you don't like
to owe people any favours.

61
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,583
It's the same for you, Master Claude.

62
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,875
Why did you accept my request easily?

63
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,083
Are you trying to fool me?

64
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, what do you think?

65
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,250
Then, I have another request.

66
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,125
I want to borrow
Master Claude's forest and this land

67
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,917
because I want to set up a farm.

68
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,750
Sure. Also...

69
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,375
It seems like
you can actually ask for help honestly.

70
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's get to work then!

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,750
Lord Belzebuth, please lead the way.

72
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,167
Aileen.

73
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,333
What is it?

74
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,208
You are from...

75
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,833
I turned your shadow into a demon's portal.

76
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,875
Demons can go through as they wish.

77
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,958
Why did you do that?

78
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:34,458
The demons will know where you are at any time.

79
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,375
Do you like ribbons?

80
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,083
I'll call you Ribbon then.

81
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:52,917
Miss Aileen is incredible.

82
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,708
Even so...

83
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:59,625
She actually wants humans
to help repair the Demon King's castle?

84
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,958
Don't worry. We are not breaking any laws.

85
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,583
I spent the whole night researching it.

86
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,833
Lord Cedric is such a fool.

87
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,542
He actually dumped such a good woman.

88
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,083
Are you being polite?
This isn't like you at all.

89
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,667
Child! Give me a status report!

90
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,750
-A demon?
-Lord Belzebuth.

91
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,500
That human over there!

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,958
Yes...

93
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,292
Stop making the Demon King angry.

94
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,792
The wind he caused can blow humans away.

95
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,000
Jasper, what did you do to Master Claude?

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,042
I haven't even met him yet.

97
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,500
Why is he angry then?

98
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,500
It'll be troublesome if the weather is bad.

99
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,708
The Demon King's mood will affect the weather?

100
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,708
Perhaps...

101
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
What is it?

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,708
No. Spreading unverified information
is against my principles.

103
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,417
Are they here?

104
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,583
As expected of you.

105
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,792
You have many enemies and also many friends.

106
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,375
There are only a few of them
but all of them are elites.

107
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,667
Doni. Ruck. Quartz.

108
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,917
Even Isaac is here!

109
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,167
Everyone is worried about you.

110
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,417
There's no need to worry about me.

111
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,042
Seriously. You are still the same.

112
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,708
I'm very happy to see Doni here as well.

113
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,292
I'm relieved to have a genius architect here.

114
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,500
Sure. Leave it to me!

115
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm so sorry about that, Ruck.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,917
Something like that happened
just when the medicine was almost developed.

117
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:49,042
It's all right. I'm a doctor. I'm interested
in the plants in the Demon King's forest too.

118
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,417
Right, Quartz?

119
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,833
He's a bit sad

120
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:58,833
because Lord Cedric seized
all the plants he bred.

121
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,208
Are you still willing to help me then?

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,125
Just in case, we will be developing
a poison that doesn't leave any trace behind.

123
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,917
Right, Lord Isaac?

124
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,792
Don't take me as the leader
of the crown prince's assassination.

125
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,292
You scheming doctor!

126
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,167
As long as this forest has good materials...

127
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,792
That's enough.

128
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:22,042
What about a bridge that breaks
when it carries more than a certain load?

129
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,917
Don't add any new ideas!

130
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:28,042
Isn't it time to talk about business?

131
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,833
Oh, many talents have gathered here.

132
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,750
Who is he?

133
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,458
Master Claude's attendant.

134
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,333
Please don't be afraid.

135
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,250
I'm just a normal human.
I also know about all of you.

136
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,083
Seems like you're quite well-informed.

137
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,708
I'm the Demon King's attendant after all.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,458
Collecting information is part of my job.

139
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,417
We've been speaking for too long.

140
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,792
Seems like Master Claude is getting impatient.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,792
I've brought our guests here.

142
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,000
Is he the Demon King?

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,333
I only have one request.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,958
Do not harm and endanger the demons' lives.

145
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:35,917
I know all your actions within the barrier.

146
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,708
Remember that well.

147
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,458
Regarding the castle's repairs,
where should we start?

148
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,958
How?

149
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,542
Rain...

150
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,208
There are many areas that need to be repaired.

151
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,792
I'm just sealing it with my magic.

152
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,917
Incredible. Is this magic?

153
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,208
What about your repair expectations?

154
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,667
A place that's convenient for demons to live in.

155
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,250
Can I hear the demons' opinions then?

156
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,333
Belzebuth, translate for him.

157
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,542
Yes.

158
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,542
Make your own decision
if there are any dilemmas.

159
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:23,500
That's all.

160
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,583
Listen well. Demons are actually...

161
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,667
Master Claude.

162
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,083
Are you in a bad mood?

163
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,708
Why?

164
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,333
Because you are quite unapproachable today.

165
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,708
You seem to be close to them.

166
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,917
It's normal to have mutual trust
between companions.

167
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,375
Besides, I need to get the new business
up and running before the banquet.

168
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,000
Otherwise, my father will disown me.

169
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,625
If that happens, I won't
be able to wear a fancy dress.

170
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,417
Is that your only reason?

171
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,625
My only... Reason?

172
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,625
A fashionable dress is a woman's armour.

173
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,167
It's fine if Master Claude
goes out in rags or completely naked.

174
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,708
No. I don't want to be completely naked.

175
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:17,542
I spent a lot of effort dressing up
in order to meet you.

176
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:22,000
Regardless of your looks,
you are still the same person to me.

177
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,250
Whatever. I already know your answer.

178
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,000
Please wait.

179
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,667
Why do you feel unhappy?

180
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,500
Well, I don't really know the answer myself.

181
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,708
What was that supposed to mean?

182
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,000
It doesn't matter.

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Look. Master Claude has cheered up.

184
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,333
Let's split up our responsibilities.

185
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,125
Doni, please begin
the castle repairs immediately.

186
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,375
Understood!

187
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,083
Kid, come with me.

188
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,042
Stop looking at me like that.
I'm already 16 years old.

189
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:11,000
Jasper will focus on
investigating the embezzled funds.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,250
Lord Keith will help him out.

191
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,000
I look forward to working with you,
Mr. Attendant.

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,417
Let's bleed them dry.

193
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,458
Isaac, Ruck and Quartz.

194
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,583
Please help with making medicine.

195
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,583
Sure.

196
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,833
I still remember the previous formula.
They just need some slight improvements.

197
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,125
We also have some leftover materials.

198
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,167
No.

199
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,833
Prince Cedric seized the whole business.

200
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,667
They'll only trouble us if we make improvements
and we might end up going out of business.

201
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,500
We need to make a totally different product.

202
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,792
For example...

203
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,958
Cosmetics.

204
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,750
Something daughters from rich families
will pay a lot to buy.

205
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,500
That is what we will be creating.

206
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,500
Not bad.

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,167
But I'm not an expert in beauty products.

208
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,292
Just think of it as developing
a medicine to improve skin quality.

209
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,083
For example, a salve
that is used to apply on dry skin.

210
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,458
I see.

211
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,125
Let's give it a try.

212
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,583
I'll also help with trying out the samples.

213
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,000
Standing beside Master Claude
will also have an advertisement effect.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,333
The Demon King is really handsome.

215
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,875
That is why I can't lose
when I stand beside him.

216
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,375
Is that your motive?

217
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,833
Exactly! A woman's beauty
must never lose to a man's.

218
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,417
I see. This is really a lucrative business.

219
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,875
Aileen?

220
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,625
Yes. She took some of the dismissed people to
the Demon King's castle to do some kind of work.

221
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:47,208
There seems to be a reason
for approaching Brother.

222
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,042
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

223
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,042
CLAUDE JEANNE ELMIR
CV, YUICHIRO UMEHARA

224
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,042
A DEMON KING AND ALSO
ELMIR EMPIRE'S FIRST PRINCE.

225
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,042
HE WAS BORN WITH RED EYES,
PROOF OF BEING A DEMON KING.

226
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,042
HIS MOOD WILL CAUSE CHANGES IN THE WEATHER.

227
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,292
Yes. It's this scent.

228
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:09,042
It's all thanks to Doni's steam distiller.

229
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,667
Well, that's nothing.

230
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,292
There's chamomile and lemongrass.

231
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,250
Isn't this rosemary?

232
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,042
Yes. I made many experiments

233
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:24,125
from Isaac's data.

234
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,625
Next is the castle's repair.

235
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,625
Doni, how's the progress?

236
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,458
It's going very well.

237
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,958
This kitchen is amazing, right?

238
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,167
It's an amazing kitchen indeed

239
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,500
but we are only cooking plants here.

240
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,417
You can also make sweets
if you have the necessary ingredients.

241
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,083
Child. Sweets!

242
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,750
Cake! Strawberry!

243
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,125
Pie! Give me!

244
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,708
Tart! Never tried it before! Want to eat!

245
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,417
You used my shadow as a passage again.

246
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,167
Go back immediately!

247
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:57,042
Cake!

248
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,500
Don't shout all at once!

249
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll make it once everything calms down.

250
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,375
Violence!

251
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,208
Don't disturb her.

252
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,250
All of you are so obedient
when it's Master Claude.

253
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,833
I came here to report to everyone
because it is a success regarding the funds.

254
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,167
Jasper is really excellent.

255
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:20,784
I heard you were the one
who found all the evidence by yourself.

256
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,250
Meanwhile, you just mentioned the people
who embezzled the funds vaguely.

257
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,583
Well, we can't report
how the Demon King is living in poverty, right?

258
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,917
The Demon King is hurt.

259
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,875
So, don't worry about the funds.

260
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,583
The banquet is also progressing smoothly.

261
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,792
Miss Aileen, you should not
let Master Claude outshine you.

262
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,958
Sure. I'll do my best!

263
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,750
You're looking forward to it, right?
Master Claude.

264
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,583
Master Claude?

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,042
Not really.

266
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,333
There's no use even if you dress up or makeup.

267
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,208
That's what he meant, right?

268
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,833
No... I think he was just shy.

269
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:12,583
I'll definitely finish the beauty solution
and give Master Claude a shock.

270
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,625
All right! Let's get back to work!

271
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,125
The Demon King's innocence
is seen as hostility...

272
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,750
The lavender is back to normal.

273
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,917
The reviews are getting better.

274
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,042
But the problem is how to sell them.

275
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,042
Almond. It's you again, right?

276
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,042
Can you also use my shadow?

277
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,125
Child. I have a request.

278
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,833
It's unforgivable to sneak into
a lady's room at night

279
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,333
but I'll turn a blind eye for once.

280
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,458
What is it?

281
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,417
The Demon King is going to the banquet, right?

282
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,083
I would like to go as well.

283
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,917
Retainers can only stand in a corner though.

284
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,375
That's fine.

285
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:03,625
The banquet is where the people
who drove him away will gather.

286
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:09,167
The Demon King is strong
but he will still get hurt.

287
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:18,417
To not embarrass the Demon King,
I heard that I will need the power of "Manners".

288
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,625
I understand.

289
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,042
I'll get you prepared before the banquet.

290
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:25,958
You have my thanks.

291
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:30,625
He must be very lucky
to have someone like you as his subordinate.

292
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:33,901
Everyone is saying
that it's dangerous to approach the Demon King.

293
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,917
It's dangerous to approach the Demon King.

294
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:41,167
I remember
these two people are not on good terms.

295
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,542
This might work.

296
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:50,167
Child, grant me the power of "Manners".

297
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,208
First,

298
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,333
kneel before me.

299
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,958
The workers will demolish the wall.

300
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,708
The demons will move the materials
and build foundations.

301
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,417
Yes!

302
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:11,042
Everyone is working hard.

303
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,958
I should bring them some food.

304
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,875
Is it your fault?

305
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,208
Belzebuth has been acting weird recently.

306
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,000
How so?

307
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,083
He is like a knight now.

308
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,750
He has been showing me many proper salutations.

309
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,583
Just entertain him for that bit at least.

310
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:34,167
You even use sweets as bait
to ask the demons to work for you.

311
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,583
But I didn't force them.

312
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,000
It's true. They look happy.

313
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,042
This forest...

314
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:44,208
The demons have a very spacious place to live.

315
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,167
Keith purchased the adjacent land.

316
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,917
It was some baron's land back then.

317
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:53,667
Master Keith is really amazing.

318
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,417
Yes. I trust him.

319
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,333
Thanks for your praise.

320
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,708
But we have some bad news.

321
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:06,958
There are rumours about
Miss Aileen planning to kill Miss Lilia.

322
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,292
What's going on?

323
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:12,500
Apparently, Miss Lilia received
many threatening letters.

324
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,958
"You are not suitable
to be Lord Cedric's fiancee."

325
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,167
"Back down, otherwise..."

326
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,042
Those are the content.

327
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:25,000
Why do they think
I'm the sender of those letters?

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,042
Because some of those letters
were signed by you.

329
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,542
The papers used are also scented
which is frequently used by rich people.

330
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,833
Threatening letters...

331
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,042
"LILIA"
I remember I did receive it in the game.

332
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:43,583
The sender is the villainous daughter's...

333
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,500
Isn't that me?

334
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,125
"THAT'S RIGHT, I AM THE CULPRIT!"
Aileen was indeed the culprit in the game.

335
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,833
But in this world, I'm being framed.

336
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,833
Papers used by rich people?

337
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,208
Almond, can you hear me?

338
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:57,792
What is it?

339
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,125
I have a task for you.

340
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,792
The reward is apple pie.

341
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,792
Leave it to me. Apple pie!

342
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:05,500
No.

343
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,583
I can't work. I reject.

344
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,417
I'm just asking it to help pick up
discarded documents from the royal capital.

345
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,792
The servants will discover it.

346
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:16,375
My powers are useless outside the barrier.

347
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:20,792
They won't learn anything
if you lock the demons here.

348
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,583
Come back immediately
if you feel it's dangerous.

349
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,958
Aye-aye, Sir!

350
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
If someone bullies you,

351
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,625
I'll beat him up for you.

352
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,167
I like Almond as well.

353
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,500
How unbelievable.

354
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,250
I still want to see your crying face

355
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:46,667
but sometimes I want to spoil you
and make you feel uncomfortable.

356
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,792
Is there anything I can do for you?

357
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,792
Where has the cold and proud Demon King gone to?

358
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,833
Retreat.

359
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,708
Miss Aileen. Do your best.

360
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,625
I need to calm down.

361
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,875
I need to sign the engagement contract with him.

362
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,125
Something doesn't feel right

363
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,875
even though this is a rare chance.

364
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:16,458
Then, at the banquet,

365
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,292
become my perfect escort

366
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,875
who is better looking than Lord Cedric.

367
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,167
You are really troublesome.

368
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,583
I promise.

369
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:34,833
Is it better if I ask him to create
a skin beautifying ingredient with magic?

370
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,875
Lilia, are you all right?

371
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,917
Yes. I've calmed down.

372
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,833
Aileen seems to be
planning something with the demons.

373
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,208
She was definitely the person
who sent the threatening letters.

374
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,417
Miss Aileen is indeed a strict person

375
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,417
but I don't have proof
of her sending those letters.

376
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,625
You are so gentle

377
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,292
but she made you feel so insecure.

378
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,958
Lord Cedric.

379
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,000
Aileen,

380
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,167
I will never forgive you!
