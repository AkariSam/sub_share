1
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:17,042
Are you the transfer student, Aili Kahlua?

2
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:20,583
No. I mean, yes.

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,042
I am Auguste Zelm.

4
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:23,792
The vice president of the student council.

5
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,125
I'm here to welcome the transfer student.

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,417
Can I call you Aili?

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,542
I look forward to learning from you.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,833
Just call me Auguste.

9
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,667
The game of Aileen Lauren Dautriche

10
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:38,917
is still not over yet.

11
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:42,958
Now, the life inside the Boy's Academy.

12
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,667
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

13
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,708
THE VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER DECEIVES HER FIANCE

14
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:17,958
Master Claude.

15
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:22,583
"ONE MONTH AGO"
I've said it many times. Please don't do this.

16
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,625
But I'm so tired.

17
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,875
Humans and demons are different.
They have so many requests.

18
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,667
They always give me
a lot of matters to deal with.

19
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:34,667
Why don't you take a break in your room?

20
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,833
Let's do it if you're willing to
lie in bed together with me.

21
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,167
I'm going to get angry.

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,500
Keith, why did you come here suddenly?

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,958
There's something troublesome.

24
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,417
We received a statement

25
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:55,167
from the demon representative
of Mirchetta, Ashtart.

26
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,292
They seemed to have disobeyed your orders

27
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,250
and started to attack a human village.

28
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,500
Mirchetta.

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,125
If this goes on, Master Claude
will be asked to take responsibility.

30
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:11,417
That's a vassal country of Elmir Empire.

31
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,792
The background of
"Regalia of Saints, Demons and Maidens 2",

32
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,625
Misha Academy.

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,458
I don't really remember the story

34
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,375
I only remember the sequel is
about how the demons lose their demon king

35
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,000
and destroyed the Duchy of Mirchetta.

36
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,792
If the duchy is destroyed,
Master Claude will be criticised.

37
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,292
His path of becoming king
will also be closed off.

38
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,167
If that happens,

39
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,750
"DEATH"
I'll end up with another Bad End.

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,458
I need to think of something
to prevent this from happening.

41
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:48,333
"We refuse to acknowledge a demon king
who has fallen to the Holy Sword Maiden."

42
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,458
"Present the maiden's head to us."

43
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:56,375
"Otherwise, we will take
the life of Duke Mirchetta."

44
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,958
Prepare the emergency measures
for when demons attack.

45
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:05,292
I already have Belzebuth and Almond
guarding the village.

46
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:09,042
I will ask Jasper to call
for a gathering of relief supplies and funds.

47
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,542
As for other measures...

48
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,250
I will become the duke's proxy for the duchy

49
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:19,958
until I capture Ashtart myself.

50
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,917
The duke seems to be bedridden because of this.

51
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,208
Can you do that?

52
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,333
I've made the necessary arrangements.

53
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,000
Cedric has approved it as well.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,917
Master Cedric?

55
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,542
I have a bad feeling about this.

56
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,500
I'll go instead.

57
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,042
No. Their target is you.

58
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,917
I have the Holy Sword.

59
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,292
No demon can stand against me.

60
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:51,125
Ashtart is probably aware of that.

61
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,375
He will probably be disguised as a human.

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,625
That place is an area
where they prioritise men compared to women.

63
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,000
It might be the hometown
of the Holy Sword Maiden,

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,042
The teaching of "Even shouldst
thou have secured the world's salvation,

65
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:09,000
ne'er forget thy duty as a woman."
has been deeply rooted in the area.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,208
So, it's better for you to stay in the empire.

67
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,583
But...

68
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,375
According to the game's content,

69
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:20,583
the fiasco is caused by "Demon Snuff".

70
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:25,208
"Demon Snuff" is a drug
that inhibits the demons' rational thought.

71
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,792
It has the same effect on humans
and can even make them stronger.

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,333
If that thing is used on Master Claude...

73
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,333
No! That's so indecent!

74
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,292
Indecent? Where did that come from?

75
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,000
Anyway, I'm going as well.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,083
I will definitely be of help.

77
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,542
Absolutely not.

78
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:04,333
You can use teleport, you don't know
how a woman feels when she's being abandoned.

79
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,333
What?

80
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,250
When you are in Mirchetta,

81
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,375
you are forbidden to use magic to see me.

82
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,708
It is a trial for lovers who spend time apart.

83
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,708
If you can't obey the rule,

84
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,042
I will consider breaking off our engagement!

85
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,500
Misha Academy.

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,958
I infiltrated this academy

87
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:34,292
to see how much
it has progressed like the game does.

88
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,750
Besides,

89
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,625
the palace that Master Claude
will be living at while being the proxy

90
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,167
is near.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,917
It's no joke if I meet him here

92
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,625
when I'm supposed to be in the capital.

93
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,000
I had father's help
so my document will be flawless.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,625
Just in case, I changed my name

95
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,583
and also my surname.

96
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,458
I told you, I need sugar in my coffee!

97
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,000
Sorry.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,417
What are you... What?

99
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,375
Can't you even do a bit of shopping?

100
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,208
With you as my fiancee, I'm feeling really...

101
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,083
It hurts!

102
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,083
That's no way to treat a lady.

103
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,083
You runt!

104
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,875
Who are you?

105
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,958
I am Aili Kahlua.

106
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,167
A transfer student.

107
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,583
Hurry and apologise to her.

108
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,708
Are you kidding me? Who'd apologize to a girl?

109
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,875
I heard this is a chauvinist academy.

110
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,458
Seems like it's worse than I imagined.

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,875
Sorry. I'm not planning
to obey the Holy Sword Maiden's teaching.

112
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:45,458
Come.

113
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,208
I advise you break off your engagement
with a guy like him.

114
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,125
It'll be life-changing.

115
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:00,208
Excuse me, Miss.

116
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,292
You are amazing.

117
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:13,625
That idiot. I told her to keep a low profile.

118
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,000
This is the student council's office.

119
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,000
Senior Kyle. Senior Walt.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,292
It's rare for both of you to be here.

121
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:33,958
I followed him here
since he was hiding from girls.

122
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,458
Stop your nonsense.

123
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,125
Auguste. Walt. Kyle.

124
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,708
These three people are the characters
who can be tamed in the sequel.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,917
The best ending in the sequel

126
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:52,250
is when Auguste borrowed Lilia's Holy Sword
to defeat the last boss.

127
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,417
Oh. Who is he?

128
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,333
Nice to meet you.

129
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,750
I'm Aili Kahlua, a transfer student.

130
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,917
You look cute.

131
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,042
Senior, you're too close.

132
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,875
You are so slow.

133
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,833
Didn't I ask you to bring him here immediately?

134
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,000
I've brought him here as soon as possible.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,167
President James.

136
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,958
James Charles.

137
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,833
The Student Council president.

138
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,542
The last boss of the sequel.

139
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:32,042
I'M A VILLAINOUS DAUGHTER,
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THE LAST BOSS!

140
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,042
JAMES CHARLES, CV SOMA SAITO
MISHA ACADEMY'S STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT

141
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,042
SINCE HE IS A HALF DEMON,
HE IS BEING PURSUED BY THE DUCHY OF MIRCHETTA.

142
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,042
IN "REGALIA OF SAINTS, DEMONS AND MAIDENS 2"

143
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,042
HE INHERITED THE DEMON KING'S
POSITION AS THE GAME'S LAST BOSS.

144
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,208
James is a half-demon.

145
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,792
He was the prince of the Duchy of Mirchetta.

146
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,625
His life has been in threat
ever since he was born.

147
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:51,167
The Duchy's churches
always have assassins out to kill him.

148
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,250
When he is backed up into a corner,

149
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,917
he will declare himself as the Demon King
and take revenge on the Duchy.

150
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,500
I believe I can definitely
stop him from becoming the last boss.

151
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,042
I just need to keep James.

152
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,792
Doing this is also for Master Claude's sake.

153
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,250
Are you Aili Kahlua?

154
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,208
You caused trouble on your first day.

155
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,750
James. It was the other party's fault.

156
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,917
Students should not be a defender of justice.

157
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:23,208
Also, my word is absolute in this academy.

158
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,417
Remember that.

159
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,125
This happened to me
when I was Cedric's Fiancee.

160
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,125
Excuse me. Are you all right?

161
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,750
You are from yesterday...

162
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,750
Your name is...

163
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,250
Rachel Danis.

164
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,333
Rachel Danis?

165
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,333
What's wrong with me?

166
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,667
Sorry. I know someone with the same name. So...

167
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,333
I see.

168
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,083
Rachel, what are you doing?

169
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:00,875
Come here!

170
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,500
Excuse me.

171
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,625
I remember Rachel Danis

172
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,208
was the villainess of the sequel.

173
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,833
She is giving off a different feeling somehow.

174
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,125
You caused a commotion
on your first day of transfer

175
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,375
and didn't even bring your textbook to class.

176
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,708
You must think you are excellent.

177
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,542
What is the answer to the question on page 137?

178
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,542
3.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,375
Correct.

180
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,917
You're lucky.

181
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,208
"SELENA, THE ANSWER IS 3"
What a relief.

182
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,042
I still remember the game's heroine's answer.

183
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,250
She is...

184
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,708
Do you want to give this letter to Auguste?

185
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:49,125
Yes. Auguste helped me
when I made my boyfriend angry.

186
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,167
So, I want to thank him.

187
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:55,417
I understand.
If you have problems with your boyfriend again,

188
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:58,542
I will help you break up with him.

189
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,875
Is that possible?

190
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:06,083
Sure but it's better for you
to be strong enough to say it on your own.

191
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,375
Just like Lilia, the Holy Sword Maiden.

192
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes!

193
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,500
The heroine of the sequel, Selena Gilbert.

194
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,292
She idolises

195
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,333
Lilia, the Holy Sword Maiden

196
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:22,625
who became the baron's daughter
from a poor background.

197
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,333
Aili.

198
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,500
I heard about the issue with your textbook.

199
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,333
Are you all right?

200
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,208
It's nothing much.

201
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,708
Auguste.

202
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,542
Let's go home after school today.

203
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,250
A girl came to me for help just now.

204
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,917
It's quite troublesome
because it's been happening a lot lately.

205
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,833
Let's talk in the student council office.

206
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,500
You'll be in trouble
if it causes a misunderstanding, right?

207
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,208
They still haven't gone back together?

208
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,042
Is it because of a low favourability?

209
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,167
Or is it because the game
has yet to progress to that point?

210
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:57,125
However, you need to
choose your friends well, Auguste.

211
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,083
Those who speak bad about Miss Lilia
cannot be trusted.

212
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,458
Sorry. She idolises the Holy Sword Maiden.

213
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,958
She even communicates with Miss Lilia
through letters.

214
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,375
But Miss Lilia is no longer
the Holy Sword Maiden.

215
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,667
Don't say that in front of Serena.

216
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,375
Aileen Lauren Dautriche

217
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,458
is a villainess.

218
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,042
She always makes a fuss about wanting Aileen
to return the Holy Sword to Lilia recently.

219
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:27,625
Auguste, I'd like to ask you for a favour.

220
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,042
Master Claude,
the members of the protection group are waiting.

221
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,167
It's about the Misha Academy incident.

222
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,583
I'll be on my way...

223
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,042
If I send a letter using magic,

224
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,667
do you think she'll be angry?

225
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:49,208
It's better to not use magic.

226
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:53,250
I see. Ask Almond to send it for me.

227
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,417
By the way, the prodigal son of Duke Mirchetta

228
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:02,750
has funnelled a lot of money
to a suspicious church again.

229
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,375
Apparently, he asked them
to assassinate his nephew.

230
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:11,083
Nephew? Did his late sister
has an illegitimate child?

231
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:15,125
Yes. She eloped with a man 20 years ago.

232
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,292
The man was a demon.

233
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:20,042
They gave birth to a half-demon child.

234
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:25,708
The prodigal son is afraid
that he will become the next duke.

235
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,958
He is also quite sure
that the nephew is Ashtart.

236
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,583
He has gone quite mad about it.

237
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,208
I understand. I'll take note of that.

238
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,042
What is it? Don't you have something to tell me?

239
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:48,333
Yes. I want to
join the student council immediately.

240
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,667
Isn't that too obvious?

241
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,000
Compared to that, we have a huge problem.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,958
Just now, I received Master Claude's letter.

243
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:57,875
Did he find out?

244
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,458
No.

245
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm just a stupid man in front of you.

246
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,375
I can't live on without you.

247
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:11,667
If I lose you, it doesn't matter
even if the world gets destroyed.

248
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,417
You, who is like the goddess,

249
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,917
do you feel the same as me?

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,208
Please forgive me
for begging love from you selfishly.

251
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,958
I'm waiting for your reply.

252
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,280
Claude Jeanne Elmir.

253
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,750
For my beloved.

254
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,208
How do I reply to a letter like that?

255
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,292
Put Aili Kahlua in charge
of the student council's general duties?

256
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:40,833
Adding a transfer student
might just be what the student council needs.

257
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't understand the academy well.

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,250
Please don't be prejudiced.
I believe I will be very useful.

259
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,375
This academy is a "Little Mirchetta"

260
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,375
and the student council is a mini "government".

261
00:15:55,375 --> 00:16:00,000
Which idiot will allow
a transfer student to join it?

262
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,958
I agree.

263
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,458
Importing talents is quite common after all.

264
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,833
It's a good thing to have more allies.

265
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,583
Let me see if you really are
an exceptional talent then.

266
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,833
What should I do?

267
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:19,000
An investigation.
A few days ago, a female student was wounded.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,667
Apparently, the culprit was a vampire.

269
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,542
Vampire?

270
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,125
Is it a demon?

271
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:31,208
The female student was unconscious
and there were marks of blood being sucked.

272
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,792
However, she doesn't remember anything
so we don't have much information.

273
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:40,500
The academy's protection group
has gone to the duke's proxy to discuss this.

274
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,167
The duke's proxy is...

275
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,208
The Demon King. How courageous of them.

276
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:49,250
I heard they are planning
to ask if the culprit is the Demon King.

277
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,375
I accept the investigation.

278
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,500
I just need to find the culprit, right?

279
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,208
I can't let Master Claude be suspected
as the culprit who attacked the student.

280
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,750
I'll leave it to you then.

281
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll put you in charge of general duties
if you resolve this incident.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,750
One more thing.

283
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,000
I'd like you to permit
the establishment of a guard unit.

284
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,250
A guard unit?

285
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,500
Since the culprit might be a demon,
we will need a guard unit immediately.

286
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,625
That's reasonable.

287
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,333
Regarding the establishment of the guard unit,

288
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:24,125
Get this document to the principal,
the duke's proxy, to sign it.

289
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,333
What?

290
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,292
The academy's principal
is the duke of Mirchetta.

291
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:34,125
So, the principal right now is the duke's proxy.

292
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,083
But, that's...

293
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,958
You will soon be taking on the vampire's case.

294
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,875
Are you still afraid of the Demon King?

295
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,167
Is there a way to turn Aileen into a bolster?

296
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,708
I realised this recently.

297
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:56,417
When my master is exhausted,
he turns into a fool for love.

298
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:02,917
Oh. The student of the academy
will be asking you to sign some documents.

299
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,208
Come in.

300
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,250
PLEASE SIGN IT

301
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,125
Why are you dressed like a duck?

302
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,208
I ESCAPED FROM
THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL'S PREPARATION.

303
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,917
So, a student is inside the costume?

304
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,417
I AM JUST A DUCK.

305
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:46,667
I don't think an ordinary duck
can ask me to sign documents.

306
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,625
THE DUCK IS MISHA ACADEMY'S ENVOY

307
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,625
The symbol of the academy isn't a duck.

308
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,458
It should be a lily
that represents the Holy Sword Maiden.

309
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,208
Master Claude! Aileen! Reply! Here!

310
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,500
I think establishing the guard unit

311
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,542
to help assist in investigations
and prevent crime is a good idea.

312
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,083
Do your best.

313
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,042
THANK YOU

314
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,292
Almond, good boy.

315
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,458
I am a capable demon.

316
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,667
Dear Master Claude.

317
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,167
I am fine.

318
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,500
Do your best in your work.

319
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,417
Aileen Lauren Dautriche.

320
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,625
Shock him with a duck costume

321
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,042
and distract him with my reply.

322
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,375
My strategy was perfect.

323
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:59,583
This rain has been going on
before I finished writing another reply letter.

324
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:07,500
Seriously. I actually wrote
such a disgusting reply letter.

325
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,750
Stop speaking like a girl
while wearing a boy's clothes.

326
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,417
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,708
Speaking of which,
why did you establish a guard unit?

328
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,208
To stop any abnormal things from happening.

329
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:23,000
After all, I'm not sure if
the vampire incident is related to Ashtart.

330
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,333
Rachel?

331
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,417
The female student you helped
on your first day at the academy?

332
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:35,167
I don't have enough money
even if I sell the dress.

333
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,083
That guy is...

334
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,083
It's fine if you want me to tell the truth.

335
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:47,375
You are the culprit of the vampire incident.

336
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,375
No way.

337
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,583
Professor Koenig is the culprit?

338
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,292
Senior Walt, why are you here?

339
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,500
A senior can join the guard unit too, right?

340
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,750
Oh, who are you?

341
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,708
I am Aili's childhood friend.

342
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,708
We met each other in the academy
through coincidence.

343
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:09,958
Anyway, both of them
can be confirmed as the culprits.

344
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,667
If you have no money,

345
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,667
you can pay me in another way.

346
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,250
When you wake up, they'll only think
that you are a victim of the vampire incident.

347
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
Everything is done by demons.

348
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,125
Isaac, protect Rachel!

349
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,583
Sure!

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,833
Master Aili.

351
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,292
He is probably
