1
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:33,490
Ushioh! Don't let them grab us!

2
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:36,952
Don't worry! Piece of cake!

3
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,249
I'm back and better than ever!

4
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,043
{\an8}RETURN

5
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:45,377
{\an8}Gil.

6
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:58,515
My armor won't return.
It was blasted off me.

7
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:05,314
She eliminated the strays in an instant,
hacking them with a touch of her hair.

8
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:09,276
So it appears you've grown, Irregular.

9
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:14,323
You snuck up behind me last time.
This time...

10
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:16,492
-I won't lose now!
-Wait!

11
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:22,873
<i>My hacking can destroy the armor!
Shide is just a human inside.</i>

12
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:27,795
<i>If I can break his armor,
I'll finish him this time!</i>

13
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:31,298
That's what you think.

14
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:35,261
These events are slightly unexpected.

15
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:39,265
They just transferred her memories
to revive her.

16
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:42,393
<i>We should have killed her then.</i>

17
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:46,772
No point in looking back.
Let's focus on the present.

18
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:50,192
We avoided the worst-case scenario
of fighting two Ushiohs.

19
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:51,277
Yes.

20
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:57,950
Ushioh... Your growth shall be
your downfall.

21
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:01,370
Now we can just kill you here.

22
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:08,127
Her blade is certainly threatening.

23
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:13,799
But if I use my echo,
I only risk losing my armor.

24
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:20,931
However, my blade can take your life!

25
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,141
Stop.

26
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:23,058
What?

27
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:28,814
Why? Mioh? Huh? What? Hey!

28
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,025
Why are you getting in my way?

29
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:32,401
Calm down, Sis.

30
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:36,697
No, let me punch him!

31
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,992
Seriously? That's your strategy?

32
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,369
Wow, Shinpei.

33
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:45,831
Welcome back. I'm glad you're well.

34
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:51,712
Shinpei, your leg...

35
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,465
I jumped as hard as I could just now.

36
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:58,385
It's nothing. Just a leg.

37
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,555
Take care of Sis, Shinpei.

38
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:02,639
Sure.

39
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:04,975
Shide!

40
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:05,976
Yes?

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,438
Where do you think I came from?

42
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:15,361
What did you say?

43
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:21,408
He really can't detect the handprint
when I hide inside Gil.

44
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,035
Oh.

45
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:24,745
Later.

46
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,373
Don't let him shoot!

47
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,002
Ah.

48
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:38,092
No way.

49
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:48,477
Gil is usually
in the form of this pacifier.

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,230
Throw it for him to appear.

51
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,232
Can I try?

52
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:54,525
Feel free.

53
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:56,360
Here.

54
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:05,786
Sorry! Are you okay, Sou?

55
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:07,746
Is he dead?

56
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,956
Nope.

57
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:10,916
What's it like inside?

58
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,381
It's creepy and pitch black,
but I could hear sounds from outside.

59
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,884
It's pitch black, because Gil has no eyes.

60
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:25,848
He has keen hearing,
so you can leave the fighting to him.

61
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:32,438
<i>With Ryunosuke's two-second foresight,
Gil might give me a chance against Shide.</i>

62
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:37,693
If Gil takes any damage when in sync,
you will feel it inside.

63
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:39,653
You need to be really careful.

64
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:44,908
We just need to confirm if we can disable
the handprint signal inside Gil.

65
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:45,909
Right.

66
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:53,375
Heine would know once the signal is gone.
I don't want to give her too much time.

67
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,462
I want at least two hours.

68
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:59,339
Won't they notice Gil?

69
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:05,721
Gil's presence is just like another stray,
so they won't spot him among others.

70
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:08,640
Hide leaves in a forest, right?

71
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,559
What if they find out?

72
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,061
Is there a Plan B or C?

73
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:14,771
We'll play it by ear.

74
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:15,772
What?

75
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,485
Let's be flexible to various outcomes.

76
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:21,695
I like it.

77
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:24,448
I will bring her back.

78
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:32,831
I'm back.

79
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:38,170
Shinpei. You're back.

80
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:39,713
Really? Shinpei?

81
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:41,924
How did it go? Ushioh?

82
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:46,386
Shinpei?

83
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:53,602
I thought Shinpei was hiding in a stray
to search and find Ushioh,

84
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,357
and take two Ushiohs with him
to attack Hiruko's grotto.

85
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,900
But that's not it.

86
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:05,364
So you looped, Heine. What did you see?

87
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:08,242
He found his answer.

88
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:13,830
Ushioh!

89
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:17,084
Hi, everyone!

90
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,377
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

91
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,472
Where do you think I came from?

92
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:36,353
It's Hiruko's grotto.
He set the restart point there.

93
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:40,315
He was in the stray
for two hours to hide that.

94
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:45,279
He used the loop to bring Ushioh back,
to go for my throat.

95
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,866
Let's rush and destroy Hiruko's body.

96
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,955
{\an8}JULY 24 (10TH LOOP)

97
00:07:58,584 --> 00:07:59,501
Mr. Karikiri.

98
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:02,713
The <i>mikoshi</i> is almost ready.

99
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,464
Ah! Wait a second!

100
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:09,845
Oh, this hurts!
Kogaito, I have a stomachache!

101
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,055
Are you okay?

102
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,809
No, I can't do this! I got the runs!
I need to be in the bathroom.

103
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:19,271
Oh, my. Want some waka-med?

104
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:23,609
Take care of the rest.

105
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:28,488
Oh, my.

106
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,037
It's flat outside, but normal inside.
It feels weird.

107
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,081
I wonder if they found out our plans.

108
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,292
Yes, that's what we want.

109
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:44,546
They will prioritize dealing with us now.

110
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:48,634
They can't start a massacre
up there until they kill us.

111
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:57,559
Gil feels the presence of a shadow.
At two o'clock, 20 meters ahead.

112
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:00,479
<i>They did figure it out.</i>

113
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:03,398
<i>Something shot us!</i>

114
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:05,859
<i>Something like needles. Teeth?</i>

115
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:07,819
<i>It is trying to pin the shadow!</i>

116
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:13,950
Tokiko! I'll go out and fight.

117
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:16,953
It's fine. I'll stop it.

118
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:23,627
Now, you all go ahead.

119
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,546
I can handle this.

120
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,840
What? We can't just leave you here!

121
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:33,470
I told you to go! Quit wasting time here!

122
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:36,431
Got it.

123
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,892
Thank you.

124
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:42,354
No. I should thank you.

125
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:48,068
Thank you, Shinpei. You even forgave me.

126
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:54,741
Tokiko.

127
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:57,828
Don't die.

128
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:01,998
You too. Don't pull everyone's leg.

129
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:06,753
Help...

130
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:10,716
Help...

131
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,928
Heine forced you to wake up and fight.

132
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:21,685
Let's go, Gil.
We'll let this baby rest in peace.

133
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:23,687
A dead end!

134
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:26,565
No, Hiruko's burrow was on the other side.

135
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,567
Yeah, this wall is new.

136
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:34,948
I can't sense anything through it.
It's a stray mud wall.

137
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:39,870
<i>They are fast approaching
from the sea and shrine grounds.</i>

138
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:42,789
Move.

139
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:46,752
There's blood!

140
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:48,837
It heals itself.

141
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,381
I'll give it a try.

142
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,050
Don't touch it!

143
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,595
What? Ouch.

144
00:10:57,596 --> 00:10:59,473
Ushioh. Your hand.

145
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:03,393
That was close. It almost hacked me back.

146
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,272
This wall is made of Hiruko's flesh.

147
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:12,736
Darn it! We've come so far!
Hiruko is right there too!

148
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:15,572
We'll blast it with a bomb.

149
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:17,699
A bomb? We don't have one.

150
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,076
Yeah, we do.

151
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,040
Mioh.

152
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,419
I had Mioh steal something before we left.

153
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:30,545
Oh?

154
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:31,880
Those are...

155
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,882
-Fireworks!
-Fireworks!

156
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:40,972
Where is Shinpei?

157
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:44,267
The wall. He just touched it.

158
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:47,604
He chose such a sweet spot.

159
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:52,234
If his restart point were too far,
his attack won't be a surprise.

160
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:56,238
but if he were too close,
he knew you would sense him.

161
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,868
Let's hurry.
My long life has taught me something.

162
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:07,123
There's not one that hasn't been broken.

163
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:09,584
That's how a wall goes.

164
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,262
Did it work?

165
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:22,848
Yes.

166
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,057
Let's go.

167
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:30,313
It smells like gunpowder
and grilled steak.

168
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,858
Don't say that.
I'll never be able to eat steak.

169
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:35,777
I also smell raspberry and rum.

170
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:37,988
It doesn't smell that good!

171
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:42,576
Get down, Mr. Nezu.

172
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,928
Give me a break!

173
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:05,932
Don't mind me! Go before the hole closes.

174
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,893
You wanna die, old man?

175
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:13,899
When in doubt,
do what your future self would do.

176
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,610
Then you won't have any regrets.

177
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:19,362
Please hold him here.

178
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:22,532
You got it. Say hi to Ryunosuke.

179
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:28,413
You're so pathetic.

180
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:31,875
Masahito? Or is it Iwao?

181
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,045
Doesn't matter which, Gin-bo.

182
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:41,092
Move aside.
I don't want my childhood friend to die.

183
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:42,928
Don't underestimate me.

184
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:46,890
If you want to go further,
you're gonna have to kill me first!

185
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,950
Shinpei?

186
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:09,287
My head is going to split.
It's Hiruko's presence.

187
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,293
I see, you can feel shadows now.

188
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:19,965
Mother continuously emits a signal
to control the shadows.

189
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,886
Once Sis tweaked me,
it couldn't control me anymore.

190
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,724
Then Mother's comforting sound
became an unbearable screech.

191
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,147
We shadows can erase the sound,
but Shinpei can't.

192
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:37,190
No way.

193
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:38,400
Let's make this quick.

194
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,487
Ushioh, are you okay?

195
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:47,409
I'm fine. Just focus on my presence.

196
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:56,793
<i>Ah... The ringing stopped.</i>

197
00:14:56,876 --> 00:15:00,130
Mother's signal is becoming subdued.

198
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:02,632
It stopped.

199
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,800
Right?

200
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,510
Thanks.

201
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:11,474
<i>Sis emitted the same frequency
to neutralize it. How can she do that?</i>

202
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:13,435
Ushioh.

203
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,228
Yes. Let's finish this.

204
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:18,732
We used up the fireworks.

205
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:20,275
No problem.

206
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:26,364
I'll punch my way
straight through that wall.

207
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:30,243
Sounds good. But there's one thing.

208
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:36,207
Ryunosuke can see two seconds ahead.
Follow my line of sight.

209
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:47,302
Shide! We'll finish this now!

210
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:53,308
She moved her hair at high speed
and broke the barrier.

211
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:55,685
<i>Too shallow.</i>

212
00:15:57,687 --> 00:16:00,356
<i>He can detect Ushioh's movements.</i>

213
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,487
<i>Heine's back from the shrine.</i>

214
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:11,618
<i>He is two seconds ahead.</i>

215
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:17,707
<i>When Shinpei has his left eye closed,
I can sense Ryunosuke.</i>

216
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,378
<i>That's how he dodged
Shide's attacks in the last loop.</i>

217
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:26,883
<i>Just like with Hizuru,
he could strengthen his body as well.</i>

218
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:33,431
<i>Shinpei gained the power to fight us.
That is what he learned.</i>

219
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,809
<i>You really did it this time, Hizuru.</i>

220
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:43,233
<i>As long as Heine watches me,
Ryunosuke's foresight isn't an advantage.</i>

221
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:49,781
<i>If I foresee and tell Ushioh,
Heine can observe that.</i>

222
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:56,079
<i>That's fine.
He experienced how powerful Ushioh is.</i>

223
00:16:56,538 --> 00:17:02,669
<i>Shide knows that her blow would be fatal.
That's why they must focus on her.</i>

224
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,632
<i>That's when we get Heine to the kill zone.</i>

225
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:12,178
<i>We'll trap Heine there.</i>

226
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:14,639
<i>I can almost smell your bloodlust, Mioh.</i>

227
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:23,815
<i>I detect all shadows from this distance.
There's a nail gun copy behind the rocks.</i>

228
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:26,484
<i>Another one is hiding there.</i>

229
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:28,820
Sou!

230
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:32,574
<i>What?</i>

231
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:34,492
This is the kill zone!

232
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,621
<i>Yes!</i>

233
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:44,586
<i>I can't move. Sou?
I didn't sense him. Well, of course.</i>

234
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:50,592
<i>He is just human.
His nail gun must be Nezu's original.</i>

235
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,805
<i>The gun I sensed was Ushioh's copy,</i>

236
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:57,682
<i>a decoy.</i>

237
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:01,436
<i>No, this is not the time
to analyze things.</i>

238
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,690
<i>Oh, it hurts. Step back.
What was my mistake?</i>

239
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,066
<i>No! This isn't right!</i>

240
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,568
<i>Stop, what's important right now...</i>

241
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:18,745
<i>is what's happening in two seconds.</i>

242
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:22,540
<i>I need to warn Shide...</i>

243
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:30,298
I told you.
Quit acting so cocky all the time.

244
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,636
You pathetic human.

245
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,597
This is so much fun!

246
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,207
<i>I can sense it all.</i>

247
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:11,589
<i>Heine's pain. Thirst. Sadness. Loneliness.</i>

248
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:28,064
<i>You want to go home,
where time doesn't exist, nor death.</i>

249
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:33,611
<i>You'll be with your family,
the people you love, forever.</i>

250
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:36,572
<i>It would be so nice.</i>

251
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:41,202
But unfortunately,
I'll never understand you.

252
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:44,706
No!

253
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,960
These hands of yours
are not made to hurt people.

254
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:54,132
I want you to use them
to hold hands and to hug.

255
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:57,927
<i>We...</i>

256
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:11,190
<i>It's disappearing.
The mud, the armor Heine gave me.</i>

257
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,236
<i>They got Heine.</i>

258
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:19,240
Heine!

259
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:27,123
I will disappear when Mother dies.

260
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,046
Bye bye, Shinpei.

261
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:34,797
Ushioh!

262
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,759
Ushioh!

263
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,305
Why is it, Shinpei?

264
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:50,605
I killed the bad guy. It's all over.

265
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:54,359
But I can't stop crying.

266
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:56,819
Ushioh. Your eye...

267
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:01,949
Shinpei!

268
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:02,867
Wait.

269
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:08,831
We haven't disappeared, Sis or me.
Mother is still alive.

270
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:10,249
What?

271
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,711
You went easy on her, Sis.

272
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,130
It's hot. My right eye...

273
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,216
Shinpei!

274
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,262
<i>From my right eye and Ushioh's right eye,</i>

275
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:26,349
<i>I can tell the presence.</i>

276
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,232
How wonderful.

277
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,110
Shide.

278
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,529
It can't be.

279
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,406
Why is he still moving?

280
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:46,661
<i>We killed both of him.</i>

281
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:54,710
Is he immortal?

282
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:24,926
