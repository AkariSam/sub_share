HISHIGATA CLINIC

2
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:12,493
<i>Welcome to the white sands of Omoto Beach</i>

3
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:18,457
<i>Dive deep below</i>

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,088
<i>Watch the schools of fish swim</i>

5
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:30,344
<i>Is that a person or Hiruko?</i>

6
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:39,645
I'm sorry, Hizuru.
I said I wanted to meet your friends.

7
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:41,063
But when they came…

8
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:43,524
You don't need to do anything
you don't want to.

9
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:46,485
I just like being with you.

10
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,615
You're not like the others.

11
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,076
Me? Different?

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,833
People run when they see me,
but you ran towards me instead.

13
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:06,463
There was a way to go upstairs
of the old clinic 14 years ago.

14
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:09,925
Rumor has it that
there's a ghost in the old clinic.

15
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,888
That's why I'm told not to meet you.

16
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:15,514
By who?

17
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:17,600
Shide!

18
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,526
{\an8}TO BE/NOT TO BE

19
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:53,737
{\an8}Shide? Who's that?

20
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:59,702
I'm not supposed to say,
but I guess I can tell you a little.

21
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:06,125
Shide is always with greed
so he's got four arms!

22
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:08,377
Four arms?

23
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:10,421
<i>"Shide…"</i>

24
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,674
<i>"Shide" as in "four arms…"
"paper streamer…"</i>

25
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,634
That's the four-arm monster!

26
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,930
Ah, right. I brought it.

27
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:22,016
Here.

28
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,058
Wow!

29
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:28,897
This is it! Thanks, Hizuru.
I was wondering how it tasted.

30
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,154
I'll be the mom!

31
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:37,406
I'll be the sister.

32
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,576
This must be another day.

33
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,998
Shinpei, is she really Heine?

34
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:51,962
I don't know. But let's watch
this memory to the end.

35
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,841
What's wrong, Hizuru?

36
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:57,593
I cut my finger.

37
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:59,887
Are you okay? Show me.

38
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:04,558
Oh. Hey.

39
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,437
Heine? That tickles.

40
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:17,696
I hate being so tired. I hate it.

41
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,157
I hate it.

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,120
You don't look well.
Do you eat anything besides what I bring?

43
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:26,580
Heine?

44
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:29,416
So many died of hunger.

45
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:34,588
Adults died, and we couldn't catch fish.

46
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,216
In the summer,

47
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:43,514
Father, Mother, my siblings, and everyone…

48
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,349
all died.

49
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:49,186
Hizuru?

50
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:51,939
My shadow…

51
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:57,111
Stroke my shadow too.

52
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:01,031
Please.

53
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:11,500
<i>Your hand is so warm.</i>

54
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,502
<i>You can tell from the shadow?</i>

55
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:14,420
<i>Yeah.</i>

56
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,381
I'll bring more food next time.

57
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,842
{\an8}Thank you, Hizuru.

58
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:24,138
You're my friend forever.

59
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:26,807
<i>It's summer.</i>

60
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,103
Hey.

61
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:38,444
Are you the Minakata girl?
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,195
Walking.

63
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,905
I can see that.

64
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:46,869
This place is dangerous. There are snakes.

65
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:50,456
Then why would you be safe?

66
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:51,582
I'm not.

67
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:56,545
That's why I'm working here.

68
00:05:56,628 --> 00:06:00,966
You're in the way. At least use the path.

69
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:04,428
What? Snacks?

70
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:07,973
Yeah. She just bought a bunch.
Aren't you having a party?

71
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:12,936
Yes, but she hasn't come back
from Koba Mart.

72
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,900
What? She said she was sharing
with a friend. So it wasn't you guys?

73
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:19,109
What?

74
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:21,028
Koba, she really said that?

75
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:23,864
-Mt. Takanosu!
-Mt. Takanosu!

76
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,700
Sis!

77
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,915
<i>I hope she has water.</i>

78
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,084
<i>What if she passed out somewhere?</i>

79
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,422
<i>She even forgets to breathe
when she gets too focused.</i>

80
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:43,634
<i>What? Who was that?</i>

81
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,727
<i>A red kimono? Who is that?</i>

82
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:02,152
<i>I have a bad feeling. Is it that day?</i>

83
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:08,575
<i>Is this the friend Sis told us about?</i>

84
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:10,536
Hey.

85
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,997
No, Ryunosuke. Don't go!

86
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,709
Are you okay? Do you feel sick?

87
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,672
Ms. Nagumo!

88
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:28,053
Is someone there?

89
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,514
What? Did she hear me?

90
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:32,474
Just my imagination?

91
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,143
"Ms. Nagumo"?

92
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:38,897
<i>Oh, no. She can't hear me anymore.</i>

93
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,529
What was that light?

94
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:00,502
Ryunosuke…

95
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,796
Why, Heine?

96
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,675
Did you do this?

97
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,844
Hizuru…

98
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:15,058
N-No…

99
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:17,978
Not me.

100
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:20,022
Not me.

101
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:21,607
Not me!

102
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:36,246
An eye? It's Heine's right eye!

103
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:40,250
Was that…

104
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:45,631
It hurts…

105
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:50,886
It hurts!

106
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:53,472
Ryunosuke?

107
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,432
Ryunosuke.

108
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:59,394
Why? Why did this happen?

109
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,355
Heine!

110
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,695
You trash.

111
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:14,743
Who? Who are those guys?

112
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:16,912
Here. Go on.

113
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,341
Mr. Hunter.

114
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:32,386
The hell is this?

115
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:33,637
What the…

116
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,430
Watch out! Stay away!

117
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:45,691
Me? I-It can't be.

118
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,944
Sis…

119
00:09:57,494 --> 00:09:58,620
No way!

120
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,679
What are you?

121
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,645
What the heck? Are they immortal?

122
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:27,023
So there you are…

123
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:28,233
I was looking for you…

124
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,234
Hey!

125
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,657
Sis, I got enough water for you too.

126
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:42,330
Today is our birthday, Sis.

127
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:45,500
He's inside Hizuru.

128
00:10:56,928 --> 00:11:02,809
Heine released both the shadow's
physical skills and Ryunosuke's data.

129
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:08,106
So it's Ryunosuke who is moving
Ms. Nagumo right now.

130
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:13,361
What was that?

131
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:26,333
Sorry, Sis.
I might've dislocated your shoulder.

132
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:30,253
Hey! Are you okay?

133
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:33,423
Stay with me! Hey!

134
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,177
HITOGASHIMA ISLAND

135
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:51,775
HIZURU
ASAKO

136
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:18,510
Since we're friends,
I'll let you go this once.

137
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:21,596
The next time we meet… I'll kill you.

138
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:28,019
Ow…

139
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:31,064
You… You came back.

140
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:34,901
This is before we went inside Koba Mart.

141
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,362
No, don't.

142
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,324
Don't go in.

143
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:45,620
Oh, I'm at home.

144
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:50,000
<i>Ushioh hit Shinpei's neck and looped.</i>

145
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:54,713
Papa, what time is it?

146
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:57,674
Well, it's six o'clock.

147
00:12:57,757 --> 00:13:03,138
Last time, it was before the funeral.
The starting point is getting later.

148
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:10,061
Maybe it's starting later because
Shinpei's power is getting weaker.

149
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:12,772
I see. Each time he dies,

150
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,692
the amount of time
he can observe decreases.

151
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,652
This is a good discovery.

152
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:22,198
Then let him do what he said
and make him loop over and over…

153
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,451
until he reaches his limit.

154
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:32,667
So we kill Shinpei until
he can't loop anymore,

155
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:34,753
then he'll die for good?

156
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:41,509
Exactly. Let him use up his life.
It's easier than capturing him alive.

157
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,470
Right, Shide?

158
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:45,013
Yes.

159
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:50,018
Asako. Seconds, please.

160
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,606
ONE HOUR LATER

161
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,864
Are you hungry? I brought you this.

162
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:08,411
You are a strange man.
You cook at a time like this.

163
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:13,875
On that day, Ryunosuke entered you.

164
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,504
I was surprised at first,
but I got used to it in time.

165
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:22,968
Ryunosuke is strong like Ushioh,
and you've saved me many times.

166
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:28,765
I would prefer to fight myself.
I don't want to bring out Ryunosuke.

167
00:14:29,557 --> 00:14:31,559
You care for your brother, don't you?

168
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,561
Why do you think so?

169
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,398
I have a sister too, so I understand.

170
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:42,988
You don't want Ryunosuke
to fight shadows and suffer again.

171
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,949
You're overthinking it.

172
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:47,617
Am I?

173
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,285
I'm only looking after myself.

174
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:54,624
<i>If he fought with all his power,
my body would shatter into pieces.</i>

175
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:58,336
<i>On that day, when my shoulder
was dislocated and my ankle was sprained,</i>

176
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,840
<i>I was in bed unable to move for five days.</i>

177
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:04,509
What a royal pain, right?

178
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:08,638
Oh, did you not like spicy food?

179
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:11,683
No, this is great.
It reminds me of eating at Kofune.

180
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:18,606
Every 22nd, Mio's shadow was at Kofune,
but tonight, she'll likely come here.

181
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,359
<i>Shadow Mioh pretty much ignores Mio.</i>

182
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,614
<i>She has an order that overrules
her instinct to kill her original.</i>

183
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:28,825
It's an order from Heine.

184
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,036
We can use that to our advantage.

185
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:32,495
Yes.

186
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:37,459
With this mark,
can Heine know my location too?

187
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:43,423
We'll find out. Since the enemy loops too,
we must move quickly.

188
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:49,137
If Ushioh shares her memories,
others will feel like they looped.

189
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:53,808
We will attack at full combat capability
from the very beginning.

190
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:01,441
Sorry I called you a monster.

191
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:04,694
You were fighting as hard as you could.

192
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:10,742
Oh, at the summer festival? No worries.
I am sort of a monster.

193
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,993
I'm not upset at…

194
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:16,664
I thought I'd never see you again!

195
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:21,127
<i>Mio, don't cry so much.</i>

196
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:27,592
Sis, let me fight.
I can't just watch you two protect me.

197
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:31,429
Mio, we brought you here to keep you safe.

198
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:34,516
Shinpei, I'm ready to fight back.

199
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,768
BISTRO KOFUNE

200
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:47,403
<i>Alain's not picking up.
He's usually home by now.</i>

201
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:56,037
Shinpei?

202
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,249
Are you okay?

203
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:04,420
Yes, I'm just a bit nervous.
Do I have to do this?

204
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:10,301
A mission needs a leader.
Everyone wants to hear from you.

205
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:16,850
Ah, I don't think I can be the leader.
You are better at that.

206
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,310
It's gotta be you, Shinpei!

207
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:23,815
If it weren't for your powers,
none of us would be here like this.

208
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,070
Okay… Well…

209
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:34,492
I have always stepped back
to look at things.

210
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:40,248
It felt like another me was looking
from high above and thinking.

211
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:46,379
I was able to see myself
amidst my surroundings.

212
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:49,549
Even if I messed up,
it didn't feel personal.

213
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:52,510
I thought I was being smart
by living like that.

214
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:56,264
But after Ushio died,
I'm just left with regrets.

215
00:17:56,389 --> 00:18:01,311
I should've at least called her.
I could've come home for New Years.

216
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,356
<i>I should've made her
that curry one last time.</i>

217
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:08,109
<i>I thought I saw everything,
but I missed that.</i>

218
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:11,070
I've made so many mistakes.

219
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:16,159
It hurts me to regret things I can't fix.

220
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:22,540
I'll probably have regrets again,
but I don't want to ever feel like this.

221
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:27,754
So I will avoid doing anything
that I might regret.

222
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,006
I decided to run away from it.

223
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,633
Run away?

224
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:35,970
But that doesn't mean
I don't have to do anything.

225
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:41,476
If I'm going to have regrets,
I will do something about it.

226
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:44,938
That's how I feel now.

227
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:50,902
In other words,
even if I fail and end up dead…

228
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:55,365
I want to think that
I gave my whole life for this.

229
00:18:55,949 --> 00:19:01,329
You saw that Ushio fought alone
with shadows before she died.

230
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,791
She lost her life, trying to save Shiori.

231
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:11,005
She must've been truly disappointed.

232
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:13,466
I will finish what she started.

233
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:17,053
I won't let the end of that
summer festival repeat itself.

234
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,015
If we all work together,
I believe we will be successful,

235
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:22,892
but don't take my word for it.

236
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:24,602
No, huh?

237
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:29,649
I can't guarantee your lives.
I don't know if we will win this fight.

238
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,611
But I'm not giving you
the choice to leave either.

239
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:37,991
I know I'm being selfish,
but I don't want any regrets.

240
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:44,038
I'm forcing you to stay because
I don't want to regret not forcing you.

241
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:48,293
<i>Please take a weapon and fight with me.</i>

242
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:56,634
Okay. How will it come?

243
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,936
Oh, a snake.

244
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:19,532
You're crazy. You want us to die for you?
We're not your pawns!

245
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:25,705
Shinpei loves the island and all of you!

246
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:31,169
He's not good with words,
but Shinpei is on your side.

247
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:34,630
What's wrong with taking the side
of people you love?

248
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:36,382
I'll fight!

249
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:37,842
Mio?

250
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,135
Me too, Shinpei!

251
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:43,848
I'm always on your side.
That never changes.

252
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:45,767
Do you know the facts?

253
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,228
Do you know how many shadows
are on this island?

254
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:55,318
We've got no chance.
Even more so if Heine is looping.

255
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:59,739
Shinpei is trying to get us all killed.

256
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:00,782
Tokiko!

257
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:03,117
That's right! Tell it to him!

258
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,583
But… I've already died once.
My life is yours now.

259
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,086
What?

260
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:16,172
There is no path forward
without exterminating them.

261
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:20,593
Darn… No…

262
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:26,933
Fine, let's do this!
I'm a man of action! Darn it!

263
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:30,978
Thank you, everyone.

264
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:43,950
<i>What? I'm at home.</i>

265
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,621
<i>I'm back? I looped.</i>

266
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:52,166
<i>I… died?</i>

267
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,835
<i>When?</i>

268
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,051
