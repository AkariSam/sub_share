1
00:00:00,815 --> 00:00:07,154
<i>In the Great Kyoho Famine in 1732,
many died of starvation on Hitogashima.</i>

2
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:12,868
<i>Just as the island was dying off,
a whale washed up on Omotohama Beach.</i>

3
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:18,624
<i>Overjoyed with this gift from God,
the islanders gathered to devour it.</i>

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:24,797
<i>As a fisherman's daughter came,
the whale's body suddenly flashed.</i>

5
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:28,217
<i>In a brink of an eye,
it took the form of that girl.</i>

6
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,761
Then it consumed the girl.

7
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:37,059
Fearing a curse, people worshipped it
as the living goddess Hiruko.

8
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:40,521
This is the Hiruko's Lore,
a Hitogashima legend.

9
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:15,032
MEETING

10
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:16,367
Do you sense any shadows?

11
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:17,493
No.

12
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:22,206
Ms. Nagumo was right.
Karikiri is not a shadow.

13
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,292
Okay, but don't let your guard down.

14
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:26,669
Got it.

15
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:31,173
Well, well. It's been so hot recently.

16
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:32,091
Yes.

17
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:35,719
Is Tokyo hotter than Wakayama?

18
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,055
No, it's not much different.

19
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,140
Here, have some cold barley tea.

20
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:46,021
Thank you.
Didn't you come to Tokyo last year?

21
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:46,981
Huh?

22
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:51,443
Yesterday you told me that
you went to a game event in Tokyo.

23
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:55,906
Ah! That's right.
It was near the ocean, in Makuhari.

24
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,245
Makuhari is in Chiba,
but Tokyo really was hot!

25
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,373
There were so many people, too.

26
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:08,335
You like games, don't you?
What type do you play?

27
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,505
I used to love RPGs,

28
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:15,676
but now it's FPS or simulation games.

29
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,636
Are you going again this year?

30
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,598
No, I probably won't make it this year.

31
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:26,186
I was really looking forward
to the FF7 Remake.

32
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,065
Is it good? I hear a lot about it.

33
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,902
What? You've never played it before?

34
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:36,238
I wasn't born yet when it first came out.

35
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,369
Its worldview is unique, maybe because
it came out at the end of the century.

36
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:45,748
Both its art and music have
a mood of decadence.

37
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:49,626
It makes you think about the end of life.

38
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,799
Life? Games to you are like novels for me.

39
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:59,845
Do you know the novel Swamp Man
by Ryunosuke Nagumo?

40
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:06,935
I love it so much that it feels like
it was written about my life.

41
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:14,151
I'm not familiar with that novel,
but I know the Swamp Man theory.

42
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,070
Is it about that?

43
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:23,160
<i>Yes, a protagonist's copy appears
and lives in his place.</i>

44
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:27,581
<i>No one at home or school notices
that he is a copy.</i>

45
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:33,462
<i>It perfectly copies all memories,
personality, and DNA of the original.</i>

46
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,967
<i>If that's the case, do you think
that it is the same person as the orginal?</i>

47
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:43,514
I would think it's the same person.

48
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:48,227
Human cells are replaced each day,
because of our metabolism.

49
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,772
Our cells continuously divide
and copy themselves.

50
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:55,609
Whether it was done in a flash or slowly
won't make difference.

51
00:04:55,984 --> 00:04:59,154
So you believe a copy is the same
as the original.

52
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:01,865
Yes, I do.

53
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,707
Is this always on your mind?
It was the shadow sickness yesterday.

54
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,086
I also looked into the Hiruko's Lore.

55
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:19,925
I was going to ask you,
then Hizuru told me the details.

56
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:26,932
Around 300 years ago in the Edo period,
a god Hiruko drifted to this island.

57
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:34,898
<i>In the far past, it arrived from
outside this realm, let's say, space.</i>

58
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:39,278
<i>It was an organism that
lived in outer space.</i>

59
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:45,784
<i>It copied nearby objects, transformed,
and consumed the copied data,</i>

60
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:50,122
<i>but it had a limited choice of objects
to transform into in space.</i>

61
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,668
<i>It probably came down to Earth
in the form of a meteorite.</i>

62
00:05:55,878 --> 00:06:00,382
<i>It fell into the ocean,
and copied many things.</i>

63
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,637
Up to this point is Hizuru's theory.

64
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:10,350
However, the rest of the story is
in the written records of Hiruko's Lore.

65
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:14,313
<i>300 years ago,
it transformed into a whale,</i>

66
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:18,025
<i>and for some reason,
it washed up on this island.</i>

67
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:22,404
<i>It copied a fisherman's daughter
who came to see the whale.</i>

68
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,158
That was the start of the shadow sickness.

69
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:32,122
That's what they say in Hiruko's Lore.
Are you saying that it's a true story?

70
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:35,125
Yes. Shadows exist.

71
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,506
Like they killed Ushio and my parents,

72
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:44,885
they will kill everyone who come
to these grounds tomorrow.

73
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:50,390
Oh, sorry. You've read too many stories.

74
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:56,104
I know you're upset about Ushio's death.
You need some rest.

75
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:58,482
I know everything.

76
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,779
Karikiri, you knew that
this is a true story.

77
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:07,991
After all, you've watched it all unfold.

78
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:08,992
Wow.

79
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:10,035
What is it?

80
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:11,203
A whale?

81
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:25,300
I didn't notice at first,
but Dr. Hishigata pointed you out.

82
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:30,055
The man on your right is
Dr. Hishigata's grandfather.

83
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:33,934
Why are you in a photograph
that is 70 years old?

84
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:38,397
Masahito Karikiri, or Shidehiko Hishigata?

85
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:42,234
You are Shide.

86
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:45,279
Heine!

87
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:50,367
Come back here, Heine!

88
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:06,341
Heine? Come here.

89
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,552
Ah, Mr. Shide.

90
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:20,188
Shinpei...

91
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,822
Move, and I'll kill you.

92
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:31,783
What has Dr. Hishigata told you?

93
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:37,748
I'm asking questions here.
Look at the other photograph.

94
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:46,965
That one is from 40 years ago.
Dr. Hishigata's father took it.

95
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:51,887
You are not a shadow,
but not human either.

96
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,099
Swamp Man...

97
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,483
{\an8}Hiruko? Why would it be here?

98
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:07,444
I don't know. Just a guess.

99
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:13,075
<i>If so, Hishigata Clinic and Hito Shrine
must be connected somehow.</i>

100
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:16,912
{\an8}The identity of Four-arm could be
Masahito Karikiri.

101
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:19,706
Huh? The Karikiri boy?

102
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:22,125
Aren't you thinking the same thing?

103
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,210
Yes.

104
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:29,633
If Hiruko is the mother of shadows,
the shrine worshipping her is suspicious.

105
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,426
Karikiri is the priest there.

106
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,638
Yeah, but isn't Karikiri a human?

107
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:41,311
Why would Four-arm hide its face?
If it were a shadow, it should transform.

108
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,107
What if it is actually a human
who is incapable of copying?

109
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:50,320
I've never seen it scan anything,
but it did print.

110
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:53,365
If Four-arm is a human

111
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:57,869
who wears the sludge of shadows
as an armor...

112
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,751
It wants to hide its face
because we would recognize him.

113
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:06,753
SIXTH LOOP JULY 22
AFTER CANCELING ENTRY TO KOBA MART

114
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:07,754
Ah!

115
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:16,471
How could it do that to Ryunosuke.
Four-arm must be Masahito Karikiri.

116
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,975
I am certain after facing it
in your memories.

117
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,185
How could you tell?

118
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,231
I never liked that priest.

119
00:10:26,314 --> 00:10:29,025
Four-arm disgusts me in the same way.

120
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:29,943
What do you mean?

121
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,197
He can hide his face,
but not what's inside.

122
00:10:34,364 --> 00:10:39,161
The fact that Nezu's shots didn't work
can be explained if it's human.

123
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:42,622
However, Karikiri was at the funeral
during that time.

124
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,499
Maybe he sent his shadow to the funeral.

125
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:50,297
If there really is a human inside,
we can assassinate him.

126
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:53,425
If he is human, killing him is easy.

127
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:58,388
I'll casually visit the shrine,
and shoot him while we chat.

128
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,432
That's murder!

129
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:03,018
We need more evidence.

130
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:07,606
We might be able to persuade him too.

131
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:13,069
{\an8}Shide burned his left hand.
It shall help us find his identity.

132
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:16,031
{\an8}Look at this.

133
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:20,368
Shide is Heine's guardian,
and the first child Heine bore.

134
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:25,707
Its original is Shidehiko Hishigata,
founder of the Hishigata Clinic.

135
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,708
Ah!

136
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:29,377
What is this photograph?

137
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:34,424
The Hishigata family was in charge
of religious ceremonies on the island,

138
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:39,262
until Shidehiko's father began
playing doctor in the Edo period.

139
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:43,975
Did you say Hishigata?
The Karikiris have the shrine.

140
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:50,440
Karikiris and Hishigatas are related.
They branched off from Hishigatas.

141
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:54,903
Are you familiar with Hiruko's Lore?

142
00:11:54,986 --> 00:12:00,867
The day Hiruko drifted here,
Hiruko became Heine, and then a god.

143
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:02,828
That's right.

144
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:07,040
In time, Shidehiko had a child
with this god.

145
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,711
The child wasn't born
from a scanned shadow.

146
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,174
He got Heine's body pregnant,
and she gave birth to a child.

147
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:21,680
He called himself a god's husband,
and took Heine's surname, Karikiri.

148
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,140
Shidehiko had a brother.

149
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,143
<i>After Heine gave birth,
the Hishigata family split,</i>

150
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:32,357
<i>and Karikiris became priests
while Hishigatas were doctors.</i>

151
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,611
So Shide and we are blood-related?

152
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:37,571
I can't believe it.

153
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:40,031
What happened to the child?

154
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:45,245
<i>When the child grew older,
it was a splitting image of Shidehiko.</i>

155
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,581
That must be the nature of a shadow.

156
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:51,209
A child from Heine's pregnancy
is the father's clone.

157
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:57,382
Shidehiko notices this,
and kindles a certain desire.

158
00:12:58,008 --> 00:12:59,593
It can't be.

159
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:06,016
He made Heine copy and implant
his personality and memory in the clone.

160
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,977
<i>In this way, he was reborn.</i>

161
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,899
Such a sick bastard.
No wonder I hated him.

162
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:18,361
My father helped deliver the baby,
and took that photo.

163
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:24,409
<i>His current body was born that day.
Shide repeated this technique.</i>

164
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,787
<i>He made Heine give birth
to his new body over and over,</i>

165
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:32,459
<i>and that's how he has lived
for 300 years now.</i>

166
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,134
You're a hybrid of human and shadow.

167
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:46,348
Well, well, Shinpei.
You don't play fair. You loop.

168
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:49,309
You can't possibly know so much
in just one day.

169
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:54,272
Take a seat and have some tea.
It's not poisoned.

170
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,232
So you admit it.

171
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:11,623
I was 40 years old back then.

172
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:18,338
<i>It was the summer of 1732,
the year of the Great Kyoho Famine.</i>

173
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:22,133
Do you know about it?
It's in the textbooks.

174
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:28,974
We had a terrible harvest year.
Fishermen died, so we had no fish either.

175
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,685
But then, Heine showed up.

176
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:36,690
<i>Islanders believed that
god was in items that drifted ashore,</i>

177
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,901
<i>so they believed Heine was a god.</i>

178
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:44,364
In exchange for eating the people,
Heine blessed the fishing.

179
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,241
No,

180
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:51,830
she just turned a few hundred people
into shadows,

181
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:56,543
because shadows can easily catch fish
and save people from starving.

182
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,505
Hitogashima still exists, thanks to me.

183
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:05,260
Shut up! Are you justifying yourself?

184
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,595
Why did you kill Shinpei's parents?

185
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,683
Same as Ushio, they got in the way.

186
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,061
They found Hiruko's grotto
and tried to make it public.

187
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:19,190
They were a foolish couple,
but Mother enjoyed her meal.

188
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,651
Unforgivable.

189
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:27,073
Oh, would you have liked it
if I made them shadows instead?

190
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,504
I am not like you.

191
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,677
I don't want to kill people.
You don't want to die, do you?

192
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:51,848
Why go so far to protect Heine?

193
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:57,687
You're human, so you can't go with Heine
to her home.

194
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:02,400
Give up Heine and end this.

195
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:07,614
That is not how I end.
My mission is to fulfill Mother's wish.

196
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:11,367
<i>Dammit.</i>

197
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:15,955
And you never know. I might have a shadow.

198
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,416
Something is odd.

199
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,878
Pull the trigger!
I sense no shadows nearby!

200
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:24,589
<i>Why? Why is he...</i>

201
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:29,052
Shoot, Shinpei!
Now is the only chance to kill Shide!

202
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:33,014
I know what you are thinking.

203
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:36,768
Why isn't his left hand burned?

204
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:37,811
Right?

205
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:43,233
By the way, Shinpei. Can I move?

206
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,236
I've had enough. I can't take it anymore!

207
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,737
Ushioh! Wait!

208
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:31,197
He's dead. So that's it?

209
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:37,078
I said I would do it.
I didn't want to make you do this.

210
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:41,082
I can't let you murder someone.

211
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:44,794
Why not? It was my revenge.

212
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:47,755
You're kind, so you'd have regretted it.

213
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:52,844
You view everyone as people,
even me and him.

214
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:57,223
Leave all the dirty work to me.

215
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:58,975
Ushioh.

216
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:03,188
Let me borrow this.

217
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:08,735
Did you hear? I killed Shide.

218
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,544
Shin...

219
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,966
Okay. One down.

220
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:39,390
<i>Shide... Why?</i>

221
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:47,273
<i>No, it can't be.
I'm sorry, Shinpei. I didn't notice...</i>

222
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:04,499
That was so close, Shinpei.

223
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:10,463
I guess you didn't step back enough
to look at the situation.

224
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:17,762
<i>You're going alone?</i>

225
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:19,347
<i>Persuade him?</i>

226
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,767
<i>I'm against it.</i>

227
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,271
<i>If Shide shows his flesh,
pull the trigger.</i>

228
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:29,482
<i>I'll kill him.</i>

229
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,443
<i>No, let me try once.</i>

230
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:40,368
<i>If I don't know what's on his mind,
then I can't kill him.</i>

231
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:46,332
<i>I want him to tell me himself
why he killed my parents.</i>

232
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,086
<i>Otherwise, I'm not satisfied.</i>

233
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,087
<i>But...</i>

234
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,258
<i>I'll endure dying once just to hear that!</i>

235
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:58,094
<i>I'm still going with you.</i>

236
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:02,765
<i>If the shrine is full of shadows,
you won't stand a chance to talk.</i>

237
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:10,773
<i>Ushioh is right. If you go alone,
they might try to capture you.</i>

238
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:16,529
<i>We'll be on the grounds, too.</i>

239
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:17,697
<i>Fine.</i>

240
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:19,657
<i>Can we somehow hear their conversation?</i>

241
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,871
<i>Maybe put a phone in your pocket
and do multi-way calling?</i>

242
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,957
<i>No, you won't be able to hear
the conversation clearly.</i>

243
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,335
<i>We just need to hear gunshots.</i>

244
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,424
<i>I'll shoot twice into his shadow.</i>

245
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:41,262
<i>If you hear three shots,
come in to check if it is human.</i>

246
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:53,941
Don't you feel like a kid who forgot
to save at the end of the game?

247
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:56,903
Ushioh is dead.

248
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,824
Brats.

249
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:07,205
You thought you could mess with my ending?

250
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:11,292
<i>Don't worry. I'm with you, no matter what.</i>

251
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:15,880
The only loop you will be in
is despair and regret.

252
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,841
Take care now.

253
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:30,436
Shinpei really gets led around
by the nose.

254
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,939
Yeah! They're like a couple.

255
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,945
Huh?

256
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:40,238
Where did Ushioh go?

257
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:43,741
She was just there.

258
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:48,830
Shinpei?

259
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:24,967
