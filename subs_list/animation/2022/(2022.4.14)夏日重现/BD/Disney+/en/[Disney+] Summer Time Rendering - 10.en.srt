1
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,577
{\an8}INTO THE DARKNESS

2
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,578
{\an8}Are you okay?

3
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,788
{\an8}It doesn't hurt or anything.

4
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:41,540
Found you.

5
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:47,463
After she grabbed me,
Shiori's face looked different.

6
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,422
What?

7
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:50,382
<i>So I'm the only one who saw it.</i>

8
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:55,596
<i>There's no doubt about it.
It was the girl from the festival.</i>

9
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,099
<i>What does this mean?</i>

10
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:04,897
Your memory was damaged
in the fight with Shiori's shadow…

11
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:07,233
when you turned into a dark blob.

12
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,987
<i>But it didn't have time
to completely erase me.</i>

13
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:16,492
<i>I restored my body
from the remaining data…</i>

14
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,954
and returned to show you
the truth, Shinpei.

15
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,586
It really started to rain.

16
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,130
That's why I told you we needed umbrellas.

17
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:35,094
Right. Impressive, Shinpei.
You even stepped back from time.

18
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:37,346
We're going to the old clinic now.

19
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:42,017
What? In this rain?
That place is in the mountains.

20
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,020
It will get dark soon.

21
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:46,480
Why does that matter?

22
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:48,440
Ushio went there.

23
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,527
We don't have time.

24
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,739
Don't come if you don't want to.
Ushio knows the place.

25
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:58,701
You really are something.

26
00:02:59,118 --> 00:02:59,952
Dummy.

27
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,037
Of course, I'm coming.

28
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:02,955
Okay.

29
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,835
I wonder if it will stop?

30
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:11,547
Tomorrow is the festival,
so I hope it clears up before then.

31
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,718
Are you going?

32
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:19,930
I don't know. There's so much going on.

33
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:22,474
Right, I'm sorry.

34
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:27,438
{\an8}It's fine. I don't have a <i>yukata</i> either.

35
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,276
{\an8}Oh, don't worry.
I have one that you can wear.

36
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,236
Thank you, Tokiko.

37
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:37,406
But I…

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,746
Please, Mio, stay with me tomorrow!

39
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,122
Tokiko?

40
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:46,707
Oof! This is terrible!

41
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,127
I'm soaked. Jeez.

42
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,589
Are you girls from this island?

43
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:54,506
Yes…

44
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,133
Wait, Mio.

45
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:58,510
Who's asking?

46
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:01,430
Ah, sorry.

47
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:07,144
{\an8}I'm Miura, from the Wakayama North Police.
Do you know Kobayakawa of Koba Mart?

48
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:13,817
Sorry for the wait.

49
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,749
Do you want me to tease that outfit?

50
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:31,001
Hey! I'm being serious here!

51
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:34,338
What about your outfit?
You're not armed at all!

52
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,422
No worries.

53
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:36,382
What?

54
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,468
I'm with him.

55
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,471
You were armed with Ushioh?

56
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,808
DANGER: KEEP OUT

57
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:49,978
Why were you trying to search
the old clinic?

58
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:54,817
Oh, I actually tried to sneak in
during the summer of fourth grade.

59
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,278
Totsumura and his friends invited me
to go ghost hunting.

60
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:04,284
Man, he's a cop.
Didn't he see the "Keep Out" sign?

61
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:06,245
Look who's talking.

62
00:05:06,328 --> 00:05:09,206
But we couldn't go inside.

63
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,713
What are you doing?

64
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:21,885
<i>My old man found us.</i>

65
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:26,348
My family owns this land,
so I didn't think much of it back then.

66
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:31,228
I figured he could be there,
but isn't it strange?

67
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,773
Why would he even come
to this abandoned clinic?

68
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:41,238
Hide leaves in a forest.
If there is no forest, make one.

69
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:45,617
What would you hide
in an abandoned clinic?

70
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:49,079
Ushioh, are there shadows nearby?

71
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:51,331
Let's see…

72
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:55,794
<i>After Ushioh restored her memory,
she can now detect shadows.</i>

73
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:57,504
What do you think?

74
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,465
Well…

75
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,509
There's none right now.

76
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,472
Come on, are you fooling around?

77
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:10,517
You're in a swimsuit?
We didn't come here to swim!

78
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,603
We're not playing baseball either! Well?

79
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:13,520
Calm down.

80
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:17,983
This is my combat outfit!
Don't underestimate me!

81
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:21,612
She's so scary. She's not like Mio at all.

82
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:24,490
Explain it to him, Shinpei.

83
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:28,994
Wearing real clothes interferes
with her transformation.

84
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:35,334
I can wear armor, but I'm a shadow.
I'll die if my shadow is stabbed.

85
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:38,128
So a swimsuit is best for fighting.

86
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:42,174
<i>I can transform as often as I need
into anything I copied once.</i>

87
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:45,344
<i>As long as I have the capacity,
I can expand my repertoire.</i>

88
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:46,762
Amazing, huh?

89
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,306
Yes, but also a bit distracting.

90
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:50,265
Hey.

91
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,444
Wow, this place was left as is.

92
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:05,155
Some of this would have historic value.

93
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,325
It was built over 100 years ago
during the Meiji period.

94
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,370
It was abandoned in the 1960s.

95
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:15,832
<i>Is there anything here
that might be related to shadows?</i>

96
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,045
The stairs fell down.
We can't check upstairs.

97
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:23,257
Can you use shadow powers
to get up there, Ushioh?

98
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:24,967
Wha… I…

99
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,721
You're scared of ghosts? How cute.

100
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:32,683
Jeez… I shouldn't have told you that.

101
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:37,479
Ah! I did it!

102
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:38,689
Cool!

103
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,693
Oh?

104
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:44,778
It's a medicine shelf.

105
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,574
POISON

106
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:49,741
This is…

107
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:51,618
corrosive sublimate.

108
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:52,703
Corrosive sublimate?

109
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:57,207
{\an8}It's mercury (II) chloride,
extremely toxic and no longer used.

110
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,168
I can't believe this is just sitting here.

111
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:06,049
Old medical records and prescriptions.

112
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,720
<i>"Appendicitis. Bronchitis. Pneumonia."</i>

113
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:13,223
<i>Nothing about the shadow sickness.</i>

114
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,392
Sh-Shinpei?

115
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:16,685
What is it?

116
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:18,020
Look.

117
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:21,607
What is that?

118
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:27,988
That's creepy.

119
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,699
It's a wooden statue.

120
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:36,747
Looks really old. It's holding a fish…

121
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,081
A sea bream?

122
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:42,044
This reminds me of the god
that brings business prosperity.

123
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:43,378
{\an8}You mean Ebisu?

124
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:44,504
{\an8}That's it!

125
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,965
It's the god of fishing.

126
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:52,429
Isn't Ebisu a chubby old man?
This one is feminine.

127
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:57,434
I've never heard of a female Ebisu. Oh…

128
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,561
What is it?

129
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,480
HIRUKO

130
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:03,190
DEFORMITIES

131
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,150
It can't be.

132
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:08,070
This is Hiruko!

133
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,073
Hiruko? Why is it here?

134
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:13,784
I don't know. It's a guess.

135
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,036
<i>But if this is Hiruko…</i>

136
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:21,416
What does Hiruko look like anyway?
I've never seen an image of one before.

137
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:26,463
"…Deformities, with a body like a leech."

138
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:30,509
Why would a god like that
become a god of luck?

139
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,691
This is a recipe book.
Did a family live upstairs?

140
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:57,452
These are old photos
of the Hishigata family.

141
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,246
Hey! Ushioh!

142
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:01,206
What is it?

143
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:05,627
Whoa! So creepy!

144
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,003
This way.

145
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,757
How was the second floor?

146
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:13,635
There's too much to search in one day.

147
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:17,097
Can you slip into this space?

148
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,560
You're making me work so much.
You owe me some takoyaki tomorrow.

149
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,895
I'll buy you as much as you want.

150
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:27,858
Seriously? You said it, it's a promise!

151
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,196
Well? Anything?

152
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,658
Something's on the floor. What is this?

153
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:38,618
It's too dark to make anything of it.

154
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:42,831
Can you do the flash?
You don't have to copy anything.

155
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:44,374
Oh, yeah.

156
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:51,923
Ah! There's a keyhole.

157
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,093
This wall might be a door.

158
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,636
Come back at once.

159
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,141
I guess we can't break in.

160
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,226
We need to find the key.

161
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,938
Damn. This is really suspicious.

162
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:10,567
Jeez, working so hard made me hungry.

163
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,360
Take this seriously!

164
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:13,278
Here.

165
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,323
A rice ball? Why?

166
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:18,450
It's dinner time.

167
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,244
Even you, Shinpei.

168
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:24,873
Yum!

169
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:27,709
That's good.

170
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:37,093
Rice really is the best.
Fills you up real good.

171
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:40,639
-You ate too much.
-I'm so full.

172
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:45,477
-You said it was female.
-What?

173
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:51,441
This statue has a big stomach.
It looks pregnant.

174
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,904
Right, but was Hiruko a god of fertility?

175
00:11:56,488 --> 00:12:00,826
Hold on. Shadow scans go deep inside.

176
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,788
That's how we copy human bones and organs.

177
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:07,541
Something is inside its stomach.

178
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,253
I'll copy it to see.

179
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:13,213
<i>Using hair?</i>

180
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,968
What is that?

181
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,135
The key.

182
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:26,268
It's a hidden door to a hole
that leads underground.

183
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:31,189
Be careful, you two.
I feel shadows down there.

184
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:38,113
The door can only be opened by a shadow.
Why is that here? Is it my old man?

185
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:40,073
Ushioh.

186
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:44,244
I'm not afraid, as long as
I'm with you. Let's go.

187
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,001
{\an8}Don't look up.

188
00:12:56,172 --> 00:13:00,510
I heard there were a lot of
underground trenches dug during the war.

189
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:05,682
<i>With the entrance closed,
no one has come here for many decades.</i>

190
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:09,019
<i>Is this a passage only for shadows?</i>

191
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:12,063
Do you sense shadows?

192
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:13,773
Over there.

193
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:19,279
I have an awful feeling.

194
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,615
Both of you listen to me.

195
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:29,164
If things get bad, Ushioh,
just protect yourself.

196
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,584
Sou, do everything you can to save her.

197
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,501
What?

198
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:37,797
You saw my powers!
I'm the one who'll protect you!

199
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:41,801
If I die, I'll just loop back,
but what if you die first?

200
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,596
Can you follow me back?

201
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:52,020
<i>Otherwise, I won't see you
until the fireworks show on the 24th.</i>

202
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:55,357
<i>No, it could be even worse.</i>

203
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,193
What do you mean worse?

204
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,570
<i>I may never see you again.</i>

205
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:04,157
Your power is irreplaceable.
I want to avoid losing that.

206
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:08,119
Hurry up and spit out
what you're trying to say, okay?

207
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:11,081
I am saying it.

208
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,166
<i>That promise I made…</i>

209
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,543
I will see that through.

210
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,128
What? A promise?

211
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:19,631
<i>I'll protect you for sure this time.</i>

212
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,717
Shinpei. That's…

213
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:26,680
I don't get it, but I won't let you die.

214
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:29,641
Will you let him protect you, Ushioh?

215
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:32,852
Yeah, whatever. Do what you want.

216
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:43,238
A black stain in the shape of a person.

217
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:53,957
This is really old.
Someone was erased by a shadow here.

218
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,838
Oh, it's just a mouse. Don't scare me!

219
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:02,799
It's there.

220
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:07,220
I sense a shadow where the mouse went.

221
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:09,055
Did it notice us?

222
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:11,683
I don't know. I'll take a look.

223
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:15,103
I told you. I'll go.

224
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:17,313
Be careful.

225
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:26,239
<i>Three shots to the shadow.
Three shots will stop its movement.</i>

226
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:38,501
Did you see it?

227
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,046
Yes, I saw one.

228
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,506
It's eating.

229
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,177
Ushioh, if you can sense shadows,

230
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,763
does it also sense that you are near?

231
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:50,972
I'm not sure.

232
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:57,395
<i>There's no point in thinking.
The present calls for action.</i>

233
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,649
We're striking first!

234
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:08,531
<i>I will stop its movement.
Ushioh will finish it. Sou will be backup.</i>

235
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,210
<i>No response.</i>

236
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,640
That means it hasn't noticed us.
It isn't hiding its shadow.

237
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:36,726
<i>Good. The bigger the target, the better.</i>

238
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,646
<i>Only five or six more steps to go.</i>

239
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,528
<i>This is bad. It uses smell.</i>

240
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:58,832
<i>It hid its shadow.</i>

241
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:08,341
It's like hitting a baseball!

242
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:12,512
Nice! It's a clean hit!

243
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,477
Oh, no!

244
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:22,188
Stay back, Ushioh!
We'll take care of this!

245
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,484
<i>Oh, no! It's going to kill Sou!</i>

246
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:34,325
<i>Calm down. Step back. It's now or never.</i>

247
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:44,586
Your hands are shaking.
You won't hit the target like that.

248
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:48,381
Relax and focus.

249
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:52,385
<i>You've always been doing this…</i>

250
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,847
ever since Mother and Father died.

251
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:58,683
<i>I learned how to step back…</i>

252
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,812
<i>and make anything seem like nothing.</i>

253
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,774
Look.

254
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,623
Ushioh!

255
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,500
Gotcha!

256
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,427
W-We did it.

257
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:36,554
Shinpei! We killed it!

258
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:38,431
Uh, yeah…

259
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,101
-All right!
-All right!

260
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,063
Sorry I shot toward you.

261
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:50,735
Don't worry, it turned out okay.
You were really calm!

262
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:53,446
I did get a bit worried
when you missed your first shot.

263
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,367
I knew you would hit it.

264
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,911
You stayed up practicing all night.

265
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,873
<i>You were awake?</i>

266
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:06,292
Say something. I'm so embarrassed.

267
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:09,170
Ow.

268
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,216
Is something wrong?

269
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,973
It's too early to relax.
The shadow I first sensed is still here.

270
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:24,852
I have a really bad feeling.
It sounds like nails on a chalkboard.

271
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,313
Where is the sound coming from?

272
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:28,564
That way.

273
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:30,858
I think it is left of that corner.

274
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,860
-Okay.
-Hey, Shinpei!

275
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,989
He went straight to it.

276
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,532
It's because he's seen it.

277
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:41,744
<i>The future that will occur
if we don't do anything.</i>

278
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:44,247
Don't you want to protect Mio too?

279
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:47,667
Of course! I would give my life for her!

280
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:54,132
Well then, there's no time to be afraid.

281
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:57,135
You just gotta go forward!

282
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,597
<i>It's the wound made by the shadow Mio.</i>

283
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:06,561
<i>When my power returned, I printed the arm
from Ushio's data. Is it superficial?</i>

284
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:09,522
<i>I haven't recovered
from the damage my body took.</i>

285
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:12,942
<i>Go away!</i>

286
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:20,116
Hey, Shinpei. I have a question.

287
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,328
Can't Ushioh copy the nail gun?

288
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:26,039
If she could, we'd have two guns.

289
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:29,000
We tried, and she was able to copy it.

290
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:31,127
But it didn't function.

291
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:36,257
As long as the original exists,
copied machines are just fakes.

292
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,886
{\an8}<i>You need to erase the original
for the copy to function.</i>

293
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:41,012
{\an8}ORIGINAL, COPY (UNUSABLE)

294
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:41,929
{\an8}ORIGINAL ERASED, COPY (USABLE)

295
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:44,390
So we can't use both.

296
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:48,394
If we only need its shape like the key,
it wouldn't matter…

297
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:54,359
but for items that use energy,
the original needs to be erased.

298
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:56,319
What about that nail gun?

299
00:20:56,402 --> 00:21:01,366
This is actually a copy.
There are a lot of merits in using a copy.

300
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:04,702
Ushioh can restore
the nails or the gas canisters…

301
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,622
by reprinting the original data.

302
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:11,626
What was that?

303
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:13,002
A gunshot.

304
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:14,003
Shinpei.

305
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:25,348
This area feels much different.
This is a natural cave.

306
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:28,810
I smell the ocean. Is it nearby?

307
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:32,397
Oh, no. How? Since when?

308
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,314
What?

309
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:35,775
I sense shadows all around us.

310
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,568
We're surrounded!

311
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,159
H-How many are there?

312
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,331
Run, Ushioh!

313
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:52,583
Run!

314
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
