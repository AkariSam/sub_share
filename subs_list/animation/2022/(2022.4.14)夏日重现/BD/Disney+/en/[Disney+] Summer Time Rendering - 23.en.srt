1
00:00:02,691 --> 00:00:05,277
{\an8}I actually thought I was dead.

2
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:06,695
{\an8}Shinpei.

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,451
{\an8}Shide...

4
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:20,209
Heine... no, Hiruko.

5
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:23,420
{\an8}You're worthless trash now.

6
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,924
You've shrunken so much.

7
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,969
There's no way you'll recover.

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,600
{\an8}Your eyes are broken now.
I'm just so disappointed in you!

9
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:39,562
But look at your right eye!

10
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:43,482
{\an8}That is the observer's right eye.
You must be the egg.

11
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:46,318
{\an8}You've just awakened.

12
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:49,238
{\an8}But why?

13
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:54,827
{\an8}<i>When Heine looked,
most of your data was corrupt.</i>

14
00:00:55,494 --> 00:01:01,167
{\an8}I didn't realize that had become
what you developed into.

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,086
{\an8}I guess only someone like you
were able to recreate.

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,508
{\an8}So that's the power of love!

17
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:11,802
If I can take your eye from you,

18
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:14,638
I am going to get what I want.

19
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:21,645
<i>I failed to take it from Shinpei
who had it in the fourth loop,</i>

20
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:25,065
but I can take it from the egg
who still has it.

21
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:30,821
If what he really wants is
what I saw in his mind at that moment...

22
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,367
I'm not letting him get it!

23
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:39,330
Shide... wait...

24
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,541
{\an8}I can still do it...

25
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:47,755
{\an8}If I eat enough humans, I'll get better.

26
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,925
{\an8}So come home with me.

27
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,891
{\an8}Maybe take Ushioh's eye...
and give it to me.

28
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:01,018
I don't need you anymore.

29
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:05,314
What's that? Isn't Heine your mother?

30
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:09,401
So? I don't care about the past.

31
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:14,448
Shide!

32
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:18,953
And you call yourself human!

33
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:22,289
{\an8}But in fact, I need Hiruko to stay alive,

34
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:25,918
{\an8}because if she dies,
my armor would disappear.

35
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:31,382
I'll take you home, as you wish.

36
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:36,762
No, I'm not going like this.

37
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,227
{\an8}Come, observer.

38
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:49,024
{\an8}Let's settle the matter. Over there.

39
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,736
Ushioh! Give me Nezu's weapon!

40
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:10,004
Shide!

41
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:15,926
Shinpei!

42
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,938
Thanks.

43
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,192
No, Shinpei, we're being drawn in!

44
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:36,030
<i>I'm weak. Too weak!</i>

45
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:41,410
Mortals can't go past this point.
If you do, you can't leave nor die.

46
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:42,661
You'll end up lost.

47
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:45,414
But...

48
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:47,124
Let me go alone from here.

49
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:50,336
No! I'm never leaving you again!

50
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,048
Dummy! Were you listening to me?
You're so stubborn!

51
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:57,760
Ryu, can you hear me? Take Shinpei and go!

52
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:04,391
If I leave you now,
Sis will never forgive me.

53
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:06,101
Ryu.

54
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:11,815
Sis made a promise with you,
and I'm going to keep it for her.

55
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:17,446
I'll be Shinpei's support.
I won't let him get lost.

56
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:23,952
I'll follow your presence. Always!

57
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,373
I'll be by your side.

58
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:31,835
I love you, and I want to be with you.

59
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,796
You have a problem with that?

60
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,220
Dummy.

61
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:47,351
Shinpei!

62
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,943
Sou! Take care of everyone.

63
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:23,762
Ushioh!

64
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:43,490
This is Heine's home.

65
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,626
Where's Ushioh?

66
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:02,259
{\an8}EVERLASTING NIGHT

67
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,221
The flow of time is cut off here.

68
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:09,224
It's just like how Dr. Hishigata said.

69
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,142
What?

70
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,188
Time doesn't flow here. It's stagnant.

71
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:18,650
I don't think I can go back by looping.
If I die, that's probably it.

72
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:21,904
This isn't good.

73
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:29,995
Ushioh!

74
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:39,713
<i>I just had her! In my hand!</i>

75
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:42,716
I know she's here.

76
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:47,137
The shotgun that she printed
hasn't disappeared.

77
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,681
So she's within 50 meters.

78
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:54,228
I can sense her too. She's on the move.

79
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,938
Let's go after her!

80
00:06:57,481 --> 00:07:00,567
Shinpei! I'm sorry. It's because I jumped.

81
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:05,989
No, I told you to go after Shide
with everything I've got.

82
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,826
This is nothing compared
to what Ms. Nagumo went through.

83
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,997
Let me control your body.

84
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,542
I'll take on the pain.

85
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,419
But then you'll be hurting.

86
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,047
I'll be okay. I'm a shadow.

87
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:24,758
I can tune down the sense of pain.

88
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,928
It's not just your leg injury.

89
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:31,640
Your entire body is starting to give out.

90
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:38,105
If I don't support you internally,
you won't have a chance here.

91
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:49,533
How does it feel?
I'm going to move your body now.

92
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:55,497
<i>It feels strange.
My body is numb, yet I'm conscious.</i>

93
00:07:55,581 --> 00:08:01,712
It's usually like that for me too,
but being conscious only is weird.

94
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:06,675
<i>Yes, but it's kind of like stepping back.
I can get used to it.</i>

95
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:12,097
Ushioh!

96
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:15,726
Can you hear me?

97
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,312
Ushioh!

98
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:26,153
<i>Ryunosuke, is this Hitogashima Island?</i>

99
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:31,533
<i>It looks similar to the sea,
and the Wakayama mainland.</i>

100
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:33,243
Yes.

101
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:37,164
Hey, Shinpei?

102
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:40,292
I meant to tell you this earlier.

103
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,376
What is it?

104
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,421
You don't have to speak so properly to me.

105
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,050
You're older than I am.

106
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:51,261
No, you're the same age as Ms. Nagumo,

107
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,471
so you're much older!

108
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:55,724
Oh, no. I'm in middle school.
When I died, that is.

109
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:59,436
Ushioh immediately called me Ryu.

110
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,439
Well, she's extremely friendly to anyone.

111
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:08,654
I'm not the type who's super casual
just because you're younger.

112
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,781
Are you always so proper with anyone?

113
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:15,619
Yes. I'm more casual with people my age.

114
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:20,582
Then what about Mio?
You're super casual with her.

115
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,627
That took getting used to.

116
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:27,506
I see. I'm a bit jealous.

117
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,136
Well, then. I'm gonna go casual with you!

118
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,181
-What?
-So totally be casual with me! Okay?

119
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:41,311
The way I speak is how I show respect.
It doesn't mean we're not close.

120
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:48,110
No, our lingo is super important!
So please... uh... just do it!

121
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,864
What's so funny?

122
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:59,204
It makes me want to
get to know you more, Ryunosuke.

123
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:02,791
Really?

124
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,168
Wait.

125
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:07,462
Look.

126
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,055
A ball?

127
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:22,144
I've seen it before.

128
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,021
<i>It's Heine's ball.</i>

129
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:27,524
Oh! Let's go after it.

130
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:28,608
Roger that.

131
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:38,201
<i>In red with flowers...</i>

132
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:43,582
<i>She spins all the way around</i>

133
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,960
<i>I hear Mother...</i>

134
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:49,921
<i>Ryunosuke, see that sign?</i>

135
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:50,922
KOBAYAKAWA STORE

136
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:55,844
"Store"... No, Kobayakawa Store?

137
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:57,637
What...

138
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,974
What are these things?

139
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:06,605
KOBAYAKAWA STORE

140
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:08,648
<i>She spins all the way around...</i>

141
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:10,734
Are they shadows?

142
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:15,113
Not sure, but they don't seem to attack.

143
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:26,708
Ushioh!

144
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:35,342
Ushioh, are you okay?
Tell me what happened!

145
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,303
Oh, Shinpei...

146
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,931
My head...

147
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,355
this presence...

148
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,440
It's Heine!

149
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:59,449
I promised Ushioh.
Her body is a part of Heine's.

150
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:05,831
If Ushioh loses herself and Heine appears,

151
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,958
I'll kill her.

152
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:12,712
If I'm no longer around, Ryunosuke...

153
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:17,801
<i>You need to keep that promise.</i>

154
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:24,474
Shinpei, I'm gonna shoot! I will!

155
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,059
Okay?

156
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,479
Shinpei?

157
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:33,358
Hold it, Ryunosuke. It's saying something.

158
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,864
It's okay, Ryu. It's fine now.

159
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:40,824
She's different.

160
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:44,661
-She's not the evil Heine who killed you.
-What?

161
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:49,082
<i>Her consciousness split at that moment,</i>

162
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:55,046
<i>into the human Haine and Hiruko.</i>

163
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,757
So who's inside you, Ushioh?

164
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:02,929
<i>She's the girl who loved sweets,
Ms. Nagumo's friend.</i>

165
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:04,973
Her friend?

166
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,852
Right. And she is also...

167
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,104
me.

168
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:13,607
Haine wants to talk to you.

169
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,275
Will you listen to her?

170
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:18,653
Yes.

171
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:23,867
Thanks.

172
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:36,296
Nice to meet you.

173
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,384
{\an8}So you're...

174
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:48,600
You don't have to be shy.
They're Hizuru's friends.

175
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:49,893
Okay.

176
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,900
I was in a long dream, in Ushioh's memory.

177
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:00,028
Sorry Shinpei, Ryunosuke.

178
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:06,451
I got everyone involved,
you, Hizuru, and Ushio.

179
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,662
Everyone died because of me.

180
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:10,705
It's not for you to apologize.

181
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:11,623
What?

182
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:16,336
Hiruko was the one who ate me,
and that's what Hiruko does.

183
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,714
Shide is to blame,
for taking advantage of that.

184
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:25,804
You're going to fight Shide?

185
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:38,650
We're in an everlasting night.
It exists above our real world.

186
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,779
In an everlasting night,
time does not move.

187
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:47,659
Shinpei and Ushioh, can you see that?

188
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,619
Yeah.

189
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,497
Now look at Ryunosuke with those eyes.

190
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:55,125
Ah! Ryu is not ahead of us.

191
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,546
You're right.
I've been talking without lapse.

192
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:06,219
That's why Shide wanted to bring us here.
We can't loop nor see two seconds ahead.

193
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:10,265
He's trying to steal Ushioh's eye here.

194
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:16,730
The one with the awakened eye
sees beyond the current world.

195
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,360
He will have control of the current life,
infinite time, and space.

196
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:26,781
It's like a three-dimensional person
can do anything he likes

197
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,534
with a comic book.

198
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:30,577
Wow!

199
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,580
Seriously?
It doesn't feel like I can do that!

200
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:39,711
It just awakened, so it seems unstable.
You're in an everlasting night too.

201
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:43,798
That eye is at its best
in the current world.

202
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:45,258
The ending.

203
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:50,221
<i>It's the thought that I saw
when I scanned Shide.</i>

204
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:53,933
<i>He wants to destroy the world,</i>

205
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:58,104
<i>as if he's turning off
the power after a game.</i>

206
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,565
<i>There's nothing after that.</i>

207
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,984
<i>It's really the end.</i>

208
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,664
I know this sound.

209
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,087
<i>Central military district information.</i>

210
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,342
<i>B29s are headed north
from the Kii Channel.</i>

211
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:34,265
<i>There are 250 enemy bombers
headed north in five squadrons.</i>

212
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,976
<i>One has circled over Awajishima,</i>

213
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,604
<i>and is headed southeast.</i>

214
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:44,150
<i>May you Wakayama citizens live.</i>

215
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:45,944
It's the air raid siren!

216
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:02,877
Ushioh!

217
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:04,462
Stay down, Ryu!

218
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:06,923
Ushioh, don't make a shadow on the ground.

219
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:09,926
The fire is dangerous.
Keep your body at a minimum.

220
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,390
I'm okay! Shadows don't die here.
This doesn't hurt one bit.

221
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:20,812
Shide!

222
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,776
Nothing can touch me,
no matter what you do.

223
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,862
You look like slugs down there!

224
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:36,202
Ushioh, first let me burn you to a crisp,
then I'll take your eye.

225
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,831
<i>So about what you were saying...</i>

226
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:44,919
<i>Shide wants to use your eye
in the current world, right?</i>

227
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,715
<i>Then there must be a way to
go back to the current world.</i>

228
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,425
Shinpei, you're right!

229
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:55,763
Kill Hiruko. Even in an everlasting night,
you have the power to do that, Ushioh.

230
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:58,683
The everlasting night disappears
with Hiruko.

231
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,226
We can go back to the current world.

232
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,603
You got it.

233
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:05,481
But how? Shide is way up in the sky.

234
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:07,692
Leave that to me.

235
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:12,113
-This air raid is Hiruko's memory.
-Stop.

236
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:16,284
It's hot. I'm burning.

237
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,746
Don't make me relive...

238
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,709
something like this.

239
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:25,960
It's a memory?

240
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:29,172
The everlasting night is linked
to Hiruko's memory,

241
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:33,635
although I doubt this is a past
Hiruko wants to remember.

242
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:38,348
Calm down.
Even if it hurts, it won't kill you.

243
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:43,811
Your pain gives them pain.

244
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,983
It's Shide forcing Hiruko to relive this!

245
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,402
Ushioh, jump at my signal.

246
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:54,197
-What?
-I have this memory too.

247
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:58,201
I can push it back for a little while.

248
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,162
But beware of Shide's armor.

249
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:08,253
It works like an echo,
and sends an attack right back.

250
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:12,966
To defeat Shide, hack him,
and erase the armor first.

251
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:15,969
Then we kill the inside.
It's a two-step process.

252
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:19,555
But after the first step,
he'll get to Ushioh.

253
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:22,058
No, I won't die.

254
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:24,519
Mioh gave me something.

255
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:31,067
Finish him off in two steps,
No matter what, before my hair burns.

256
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,655
All right. I can buy you a few seconds.

257
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,205
Do you trust me?

258
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:45,206
We do.

259
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:49,711
If Sis befriended you,
you're my friend too.

260
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:51,879
Ryunosuke.

261
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,132
Right, Shinpei?

262
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,092
Yeah.

263
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:57,677
Thanks.

264
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:02,974
I'm ready.

265
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,226
Yes.

266
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,741
Go... now!

267
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:32,754
<i>So I see, you got Haine on your side.</i>

268
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:38,051
<i>I'm counting on you, Ushioh. Stop Shide.</i>

269
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:44,390
<i>Let Hiruko rest in peace!</i>

270
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,396
Leave it to me!

271
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,358
<i>At this height,
I can't get to Ushioh's body.</i>

272
00:20:56,736 --> 00:21:00,073
<i>They're fast and massive!
I can't avoid them with my hair.</i>

273
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,540
I'll kill you
even in exchange for my life!

274
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:17,548
<i>What?</i>

275
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:19,801
<i>What is he?</i>

276
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:22,303
In exchange for what?

277
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:24,514
<i>There's nothing inside.</i>

278
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,063
<i>That means I can't even cross-counter.</i>

279
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:35,733
So you read my mind.

280
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:37,985
<i>He hacked...</i>

281
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:57,213
<i>She revived herself?
Did she eat a part of the original Ushio?</i>

282
00:21:58,172 --> 00:21:59,424
<i>Then take this!</i>

283
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:11,060
<i>What did she do?</i>

284
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:16,315
The air raid stopped.

285
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:19,193
What happened?

286
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:23,406
<i>She touched me to erase
the memory of the air raid.</i>

287
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,867
<i>-Shinpei, can you hear me?
-Ushioh!</i>

288
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:29,829
<i>I know now.
Shide's body is in the current world.</i>

289
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,289
<i>The current world?</i>

290
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:35,084
<i>Shide is remotely controlling his armor
using Hiruko.</i>

291
00:22:36,294 --> 00:22:39,172
<i>If there's nothing inside,
there's not much we can do.</i>

292
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:43,134
What does Shide's armor look like now?

293
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:47,054
<i>The left half is gone after I erased it.</i>

294
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:50,558
<i>Then erase the rest and go for the win.</i>

295
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:52,018
<i>Uh, Ushioh?</i>

296
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:53,853
<i>Ushioh!</i>

297
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:25,027
