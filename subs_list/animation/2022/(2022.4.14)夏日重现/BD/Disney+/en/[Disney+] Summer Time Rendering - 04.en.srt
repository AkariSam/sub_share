1
00:00:06,654 --> 00:00:07,822
Ushio…

2
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:14,620
Ushio.

3
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,964
Shinpei!

4
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,801
Why are you here? Did you come back?

5
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:31,637
I should be asking you that.

6
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:33,472
Huh?

7
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:39,728
<i>This necklace is the only one of its kind
in the world, and it's wearing it!</i>

8
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:46,068
Ushio died!
We just had a funeral two days ago.

9
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,030
Died?

10
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:53,993
You're not her. You can't be Ushio!

11
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,454
Huh? What are you saying?

12
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:01,792
I'm alive! See? I'm right here!

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,756
<i>What's it talking about?
This is a shadow. No doubt about it.</i>

14
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:12,720
Don't you remember what happened to you?

15
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:14,013
Huh?

16
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:17,433
Wait.

17
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:19,393
I…

18
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,690
Why am I here?

19
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,154
I… what?

20
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:32,281
That's odd.

21
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:36,285
You have no memory of why you got here?

22
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:40,456
Ugh… I can't breathe.

23
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,582
Oh…

24
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:47,421
All I remember is that I couldn't breathe.

25
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:54,011
<i>In the water, everything got dark.</i>

26
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,640
Come on! No way!

27
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:01,852
Oh, my goodness, I died?

28
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:06,565
Then what am I? A ghost?

29
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,277
But I have feet.

30
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:15,741
<i>Does it really believe that it's Ushio?</i>

31
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:21,330
I remember one thing.

32
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:26,877
In the end, I wished I could see you
one last time.

33
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:29,588
I wanted to see you.

34
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:34,635
Maybe that's why I'm here. I'm glad.

35
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,557
<i>Her voice. Her gestures.</i>

36
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,269
Stop. What is this?

37
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,148
<i>It feels like Ushio really came back!</i>

38
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,279
Hey, Shinpei.

39
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:58,033
I wanted to tell you something
if I saw you again.

40
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:00,327
I like you.

41
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:02,037
Huh?

42
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:03,497
I…

43
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,376
I'm in love you!

44
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:41,637
{\an8}<i>JAMAIS VU</i>

45
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,224
{\an8}<i>Huh? What did it just say?</i>

46
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:48,560
<i>L-Love? In what way?</i>

47
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:54,525
What are you saying?
Did dying make you go crazy?

48
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:57,486
Maybe.

49
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,658
-What…
-My head feels so cloudy.

50
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:04,368
Ah…

51
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:08,080
<i>Don't be fooled. Step back from myself!</i>

52
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:13,585
<i>Two days ago, Ushio was put
in a coffin and cremated.</i>

53
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:15,546
<i>She's gone from this world.</i>

54
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:20,300
<i>It's just acting like Ushio.
What does it want?</i>

55
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:23,762
Why did you come here?

56
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,889
I wish I knew.

57
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:31,103
Don't you go to where God is
after you die?

58
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:35,732
Why are you here? What do you guys want?

59
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:38,861
What… do I want?

60
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:45,659
Shinpei. Those fireworks.
Is today the 24th?

61
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,202
Uh, yes.

62
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:51,999
No way!
There was something I wanted to do!

63
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,461
I want to go to the festival with you!

64
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,630
H-Hey!

65
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:02,926
Shinpei! Hurry!

66
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,138
<i>It doesn't realize that it's a shadow.</i>

67
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,308
Welcome.

68
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:13,312
<i>Does it really think that it is Ushio?</i>

69
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:22,154
Ah, Shinpei! I wanna do this!

70
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:25,866
<i>Why is she in a bathing suit?</i>

71
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,495
Idiot! You totally stand out!

72
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:33,123
It smells so good! I wanna eat <i>takoyaki</i>!

73
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:37,127
There's no time for that!
What if someone recognizes you?

74
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,756
<i>How would I explain this?</i>

75
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:46,929
Come on over!
Our octopus is cheap and huge!

76
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:52,351
It's really good! Hey, try some!

77
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:01,610
Wait for me!

78
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:07,741
Hey, Shinpei. Why do we need to hide?

79
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,286
I'm hungry.
Aren't Mio and the others here?

80
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,663
I wanna see them.

81
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,499
You can't! Absolutely not!

82
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,002
Think about this situation for a second.

83
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:23,298
Listen, you died!
Your funeral was two days ago.

84
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:24,216
But…

85
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:29,388
No buts! You're a shadow.
A ghost, uh, whatever.

86
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:33,392
Everyone can see you!
What the hell are you?

87
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,852
You don't want me to see everyone?

88
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:40,857
Of course not! Just hide here
until the festival is over.

89
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:44,987
Shinpei, you dummy!

90
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,448
That's a whole bunch of nonsense!
Stop it or else!

91
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:52,160
<i>Or else? She has already hit me.</i>

92
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:55,956
<i>It's just like Ushio herself.</i>

93
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,380
<i>I had a conversation with Ushio's shadow…</i>

94
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,385
<i>how it's been two years since I left,
and about our childhood.</i>

95
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:11,263
<i>It had all of Ushio's memories.</i>

96
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,433
Do you know my favorite author?

97
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:18,979
Ryunosuke Nagumo, right?
We saw a movie for one of his books.

98
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:21,940
<i>It was strange.</i>

99
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:25,444
<i>It knew nothing about shadows.</i>

100
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,406
<i>It didn't remember how she died, either.</i>

101
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,367
You're not worried about Shiori?

102
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,995
Huh? What about Shiori?

103
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,039
<i>To me, it didn't look like she was acting.</i>

104
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:38,540
Nothing. Never mind.

105
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:42,461
Oh.

106
00:08:46,256 --> 00:08:47,883
-A call?
-Yeah.

107
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:49,384
It's Mio.

108
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:51,803
-Gimme.
-Hey! Stop!

109
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,389
Hello? Mio?

110
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:57,476
Well?

111
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,438
Sis…

112
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:07,527
Hi, it's me! M-Mio? It's just me, yes.

113
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,947
<i>I thought I heard Sis.</i>

114
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,952
<i>Of course not. A-Are you okay?</i>

115
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,080
R-Right.

116
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:20,666
Sorry. It must be me.

117
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,212
Where are you? The fireworks are over.

118
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:29,758
We're in the shrine grounds.
The Omiokuri is starting.

119
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:35,222
I'm close by. Yeah, I'll run over.

120
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:38,433
What did she say?

121
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,355
You just stay here!

122
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:44,731
H-Hey!

123
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,276
I'll come get you later.

124
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:53,532
You might not realize it,
but something crazy is going on!

125
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:59,287
You're the one who told me
to take care of Mio.

126
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:02,791
Regret is the last thing I need.

127
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,210
What the heck is he saying?

128
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:10,340
<i>I never said that.</i>

129
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:15,095
He's finally here. Shinpei.

130
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,308
You took forever. I was getting worried.
"Mountain."

131
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:25,772
Sorry, I had stomach issues.
"Mesopotamian civilization."

132
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,816
Told you he was just pooping.

133
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,484
What's with the smirk?

134
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:35,490
<i>In Hitogashima Island…</i>

135
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:38,660
<i>it is said that gods live in things
that come from the sea.</i>

136
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,829
<i>This belief is deeply rooted in this land.</i>

137
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,124
<i>That is the legend of Hiruko-no-Mikoto.</i>

138
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,920
<i>People call it by the name
Hiruko, the god of fishing.</i>

139
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:53,049
<i>Driftwood is collected from the beach…</i>

140
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:57,721
<i>and burned in the Omiokuri
to send the gods back.</i>

141
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:03,602
<i>It's quite a crowd.
Around 1,000 people are here.</i>

142
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:07,731
It has been so long since
we went to the Omiokuri together.

143
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:09,483
Yeah.

144
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,652
-Ushio is watching too!
-What?

145
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,362
In heaven.

146
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:17,365
Ah, that's what you mean. Right.

147
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,538
I wonder if it was okay to come
to the festival when Sis just died?

148
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:27,000
I really wish she was here.

149
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:28,960
Right.

150
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:31,338
Hey, Sou.

151
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,132
You wanted to talk?

152
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:39,179
My brother wants to tell Mio
how he feels today.

153
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:42,432
Huh? Is he serious?

154
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:46,144
I love my brother,
but he can be illogical.

155
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:51,191
However, the illogical happens sometimes.

156
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,027
Yes.

157
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:57,155
But he has no chance.

158
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,782
Huh? Why not?

159
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:04,371
Because Mio already has
someone else she likes.

160
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,542
Oh, really. Who?

161
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:12,379
Ah! I couldn't tell you.

162
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:13,964
-Shinpei!
-Oh.

163
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,883
Tokiko too. I want you to hear this.

164
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:21,137
There's something I have to tell you Mio.

165
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,599
I don't know if now is
the right time for this.

166
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:29,062
But I want you to know!

167
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:33,108
I'm in love with you!

168
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,615
Please allow me the honor
of protecting you!

169
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:46,621
-Whoa. He said it.
-He said it.

170
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:50,083
Sou! Wait! What are you saying?

171
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,212
E-Everyone is listening.

172
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,054
Why do you like me?

173
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,516
I feel flattered…

174
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:10,186
but I can't say yes.

175
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,065
I just want us to be good friends.

176
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:18,445
I totally saw that coming.

177
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:20,655
Here at the right time!

178
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:21,656
Huh?

179
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:25,368
Huh?

180
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:26,786
Hey, Sou.

181
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,829
Huh?

182
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:30,790
-No biggie!
-Huh?

183
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:33,793
<i>I said to not come out!</i>

184
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,296
Oh…

185
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:40,133
<i>That idiot!</i>

186
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:47,974
Th-That pretty hair…

187
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,561
That voice.

188
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:53,772
-Ushio?
-What?

189
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:59,277
Wha… Huh? Th-That's… Ah!

190
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:02,781
I-I'm not U-Ushio!

191
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:06,910
"I am the fighter of love, Pretty Cure…"

192
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,328
Hey.

193
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,872
Shinpei, they instantly knew it was me.

194
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,209
You idiot!
Do you even call that a disguise?

195
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:18,546
Shi-Shinpei. Don't tell me…

196
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,676
Sorry. I just wanted to see you all.

197
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,053
Did Tokiko dress you?

198
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:29,474
Mio, the <i>yukata</i> looks great on you.

199
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:32,686
No.

200
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:38,358
Mio?

201
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,445
What are you doing, Shinpei?
Get away from it!

202
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:46,199
That's not Sis!

203
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:47,158
Huh?

204
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:48,827
It's a monster!

205
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:57,335
Mio.

206
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,216
I won't let her go.

207
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:10,265
Th-That hurts. Shinpei?

208
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,309
Wait, Mio.

209
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,022
Shinpei! Explain yourself!

210
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:19,482
What's wrong with you?

211
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:24,362
You can't switch with someone
who is dead and has been cremated.

212
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:28,324
You never really wanted to switch places.

213
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:36,207
Why won't you obey?
Don't tell me you can't hear the voice.

214
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,837
Who are you? Everyone run away…

215
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:47,218
Too late.

216
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:50,263
Th-This guy…

217
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:51,723
It's not Shinpei!

218
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,441
<i>It's time.</i>

219
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,652
TEN MINUTES EARLIER

220
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:10,200
<i>Mio, sorry I suddenly left.</i>

221
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,411
<i>I can't make Mio worry.</i>

222
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,455
<i>I need to apologize.</i>

223
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:32,138
Shinpei. I wanted to ask you something.
You got a minute?

224
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:47,821
<i>What? I couldn't even see it make a move.</i>

225
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:51,533
<i>And no human can be this strong.</i>

226
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:55,995
I heard you got me on video.

227
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:03,670
How's that possible?
Unless you knew I was coming.

228
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,802
How did you know?

229
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,139
<i>It knows.</i>

230
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,358
<i>This can't be real…</i>

231
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:30,405
<i>This is crazy. Did it do all of this?</i>

232
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:33,241
<i>How many people did it kill?</i>

233
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:41,499
Who told you? The traitor?

234
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:44,210
<i>Traitor?</i>

235
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:49,674
I can't ignore that.
It'll be a shame if it messes up our plan.

236
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:53,511
Find out. How much does he know?

237
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:58,057
It's blotchy. It repeats.

238
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:03,730
Something is odd about my memory.

239
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:10,153
How many times have you been killed?

240
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:11,696
<i>This thing…</i>

241
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,866
<i>It's my shadow.</i>

242
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,911
<i>It copied me that time.</i>

243
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:21,998
<i>It has my memory up until that point.</i>

244
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:26,336
<i>Oh, no! If its memory gets updated,
it will find out!</i>

245
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,423
<i>It'll know we're investigating shadows
and about "Mesopotamian civilization."</i>

246
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:31,382
<i>It's not that!</i>

247
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,720
<i>Ushio… Why do they come out like this?
I thought crowds would be safe.</i>

248
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:36,638
<i>Think!</i>

249
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,097
<i>It's totally over.</i>

250
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,266
<i>Damn it! Focus!</i>

251
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:42,393
Done?

252
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:43,353
Hold on.

253
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:44,854
We don't need him anymore.

254
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,564
-<i>Run.</i>
-No.

255
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:48,274
-<i>Run or be killed!</i>
-No!

256
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,235
<i>Everyone will be killed!</i>

257
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:57,867
Wait. Don't kill him, Mio.

258
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,328
Why not, Shinpei?

259
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:04,916
Step back from ourselves. Mother told us.

260
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,086
He'll die, but he can redo the day.

261
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:14,300
A loop? Are your memories accurate?
This isn't a video game.

262
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,637
He has no control of it himself…

263
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,474
but it all makes sense if he is in a loop.

264
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,603
We need to step back and
look at third-dimension issues…

265
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,439
from the fourth dimension.

266
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:33,903
He probably can't do that now,
but he might learn how to in the future.

267
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:37,615
You read too many weird books.

268
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:42,495
If he goes back to the 22nd
with what he knows…

269
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:49,002
he will eventually get in our way,
so don't kill him until everything's done.

270
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,429
I'll go up. Give me his phone.
It's in his left back pocket.

271
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:05,143
Send people down to get Ushio.
She's at the storage area by the tent.

272
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:07,729
Fine.

273
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:16,654
Go. You know who is strict on time.

274
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:17,613
Right.

275
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:22,118
Dammit… Wait…

276
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,080
You're so pathetic.

277
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:30,793
As it turns out, you can't protect anyone.

278
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:34,714
Wait. Stop!

279
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:39,635
Don't touch Mio!

280
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:48,436
Cut it out, Shinpei.
You're trying to be too cool.

281
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:51,647
But it's too late.

282
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:55,360
In no time, Mother will wake up.

283
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:04,786
Come on, stay still.
You're being stubborn, Shinpei.

284
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,041
Mio!

285
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,085
I guess I'll break this side too.

286
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:40,446
Narezushi is not too common
on Hitogashima Island.

287
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,911
I haven't tried it yet. Have you?

288
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:48,371
Huh?

289
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,123
<i>This woman…</i>

290
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,501
<i>I saw her on the ferry!</i>

291
