1
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:34,867
{\an8}DECISION

2
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:40,998
<i>The date has changed. It's the 23rd.</i>

3
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:51,383
Ms. Nagumo. I found some new shampoo.

4
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,385
{\an8}Oh. Thanks.

5
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,223
Ms. Nagumo.

6
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,140
Yes?

7
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:05,147
Shinpei and I saw the memory
from 14 years ago with you and Heine.

8
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,650
Right. I heard.

9
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:09,735
At that time, you were...

10
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:13,280
Really flat!
Can I touch and see what they're like now?

11
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:14,782
Fine by me.

12
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:18,535
Oh, wow.
Don't they give you shoulder pain?

13
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,578
They do.

14
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:27,127
Why did Heine end up like that?

15
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:36,220
<i>She was a normal little girl...
when she was playing with you.</i>

16
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:45,229
That's right. I was a fool to have let
my curiosity get the best of me.

17
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,984
I think this body of mine
was born from a part of Heine.

18
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:56,907
<i>A piece of Heine that fell when
Ryunosuke was killed... that was me.</i>

19
00:02:58,284 --> 00:03:00,202
I'm afraid that...

20
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:04,832
I might turn out like Heine someday.

21
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:10,337
Don't worry. I'll kill you if you do.

22
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:14,091
Mio.

23
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,845
What? Oh, it's me.

24
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,346
What is it?

25
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,849
You're so cold.

26
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:26,687
Well, I guess that makes sense.
I do hate myself.

27
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,605
What are you saying?

28
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:35,946
Tiny nose, short fingers,
too much hair, too sweaty.

29
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,864
Stop.

30
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:38,949
You hate it all.

31
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,580
Everything's the complete opposite of Sis.

32
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:49,877
It's not just the way you look,
but your grades and personality too...

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,128
{\an8}I said stop!

34
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:57,009
You're the shadow... of Sis.

35
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:04,892
How long are you going to keep it in?
At least tell Shinpei how you feel.

36
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,478
I'll tell him if you won't.

37
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:11,815
No! You can't do that.

38
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:14,777
These are your mother's ashes.

39
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,406
I would never feed Heine
the woman I loved.

40
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:26,413
She died on January 3, 2013
from heart failure.

41
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,667
So you lied about the donor.

42
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:35,923
She was already dead
on the day of her surgery.

43
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:40,177
You should have told me
such an important thing.

44
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:44,807
The Hishigata family has been involved
with shadows for 300 years.

45
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:48,936
This secret must be passed down,

46
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:51,063
but I only needed one successor.

47
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:55,692
My father told this only to me,
and not my brothers.

48
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:59,696
I thought it would be too much for you.

49
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:05,702
You believe that human life is precious,
don't you, Sou?

50
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,205
Of course, I do!

51
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,292
That's why I couldn't tell you.

52
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:15,712
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,636
If you want to apologize to someone,
apologize to Tokiko.

54
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:33,730
Somehow,
I can't really blame Dr. Hishigata.

55
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:37,901
He just did everything he could
to save someone he loved.

56
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,906
I'm not sure I wouldn't do the same
if I were in his position.

57
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,909
But the fact remains that

58
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:50,998
he helped the mass murder
at the revival ceremony.

59
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:57,004
Human sacrifices were made into shadows,
and the memories of their murders erased.

60
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,423
He thought no one would find out.

61
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,553
It seems like your father
planned further ahead.

62
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:05,762
Yes.

63
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,350
They're shadows, but Ushioh is Ushio.

64
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:12,436
Your mother Chitoseh is Chitose too.

65
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,189
I guess I'm not that confident after all.

66
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,691
You're too kind.

67
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,151
Oh...

68
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:20,694
Shinpei.

69
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:24,031
When was the last time you slept?

70
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,199
What?

71
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:29,203
Through your many loops,
you've been continuously awake.

72
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,705
You have horrible bags under your eyes.

73
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,959
It's true that I've been awake
the whole time.

74
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,795
Don't wear yourself out.

75
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,713
Thanks.

76
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:44,218
We're all with you,
so get some rest tonight.

77
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:49,473
<i>She's right,
it might be my only chance to sleep.</i>

78
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,475
<i>Thanks.</i>

79
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,496
Where are you going?

80
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,501
Oh, it's you, Ushioh.

81
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:22,047
Don't act alone. I told you to tell me
if you need to go to the bathroom.

82
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:24,508
Let me go home.

83
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:29,096
Go home alone? No way.
What are you thinking...

84
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,181
You're so loud!

85
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:33,016
Did you forget something?

86
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,688
Well, something like that. Can I go?

87
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:40,023
I don't know...

88
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:45,529
Why don't I come with you,
if you really need to go home?

89
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:52,286
Fine, then come along.

90
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:55,247
NEZU

91
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,545
I'll be right back. Wait outside.

92
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,307
Why do you just walk in like that?

93
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:19,062
Well, I felt the presence of a shadow.

94
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:25,152
Don't worry. It can't move.

95
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:29,114
I'm home.

96
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,116
Oh... Gi...

97
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:35,370
Is this person...

98
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:40,375
Yeah, it's a shadow. Of my wife.

99
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,383
Two months ago, she went to the farm
and came back a shadow.

100
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:53,639
The moment I saw that light,
I thought of that day.

101
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:02,939
<i>I remembered the day
Ryunosuke was killed, 14 years ago.</i>

102
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:07,653
<i>It tried to copy me, but I had immunity.</i>

103
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:12,157
What...

104
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,077
What's wrong?

105
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:19,498
It's acting strange.
It never did that before.

106
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:25,212
She probably received the same telepathy
from Heine that made Chitose go mad.

107
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,215
Is that so?

108
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,842
Wait, Nezu!

109
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:34,304
Sorry, but let us be.

110
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:38,517
Wait! I can hack into her,
and she'll be herself again!

111
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:45,148
Even if you do, it's still a shadow,
and it's unlike you or Mrs. Hishigata.

112
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:50,696
It killed my wife and took her form.
It's my wife's enemy.

113
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,322
But...

114
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,242
I couldn't kill it until now.

115
00:09:56,284 --> 00:10:01,581
I wanted to exterminate shadows,
yet let my greatest enemy live.

116
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,544
I don't need any more extra time.

117
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:10,257
Just let me end this to have closure.

118
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,177
Please.

119
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,941
I'm so sorry, Kaoru.
I'll be with you soon.

120
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:39,995
Impressive, Miss Negoro.
Your bandaging is perfect.

121
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,554
<i>The long night ended.</i>

122
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:02,517
It's morning.

123
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:07,063
Are you okay? You really slept a lot.

124
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:08,398
CURRENT LIMIT

125
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:11,943
<i>Good, the approaching edge of time
is now a bit farther.</i>

126
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:16,406
I now have a little leeway
to the number of loops left.

127
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,870
But my eyes still hurt and my
headache is getting worse.

128
00:11:22,454 --> 00:11:23,663
<i>Is everyone safe?</i>

129
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:24,831
Right!

130
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:29,211
Good morning.

131
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:32,172
Good... morning.

132
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:36,134
<i>We all made it to the morning
of the 23rd alive.</i>

133
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:42,808
<i>Today, the 23rd, we will be hunting.</i>

134
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:48,021
<i>Before the final battle tomorrow,
we must weaken the shadows' forces.</i>

135
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,567
<i>Our first target are the shadows
Ms. Nagumo saw at the funeral.</i>

136
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:58,782
<i>Ms. Nagumo's team will go to the Kogaitos,
while Ushioh's team, the Hitobuchis.</i>

137
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:03,161
<i>Our team first went back to Bistro Kofune.</i>

138
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:05,330
<i>Alain was prepping for lunch hours.</i>

139
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:11,795
<i>We thought he would be angry,
but he kindly welcomed us home.</i>

140
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:17,801
<i>Rose and Gil watched Kofune all night,
so we sent them back to Tokiko.</i>

141
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:25,475
Mio will help Alain.
Shadow Mio stands guard. Sou stays too.

142
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,938
So Sis and Shinpei will be
all alone today.

143
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,898
What? Ah, yes.

144
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,985
Sounds nice... huh, Mio?

145
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:36,111
What?

146
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,572
It's fine. We have Sou with us.

147
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,740
-Right?
-Y-Yeah.

148
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:43,493
Stay safe, Sis and Shinpei.

149
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,495
Here, use this.

150
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,791
It's real hair from Sis.

151
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,126
What's this for?

152
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:52,586
Oh, I get it!

153
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:59,175
I found hair on the floor of some rooms.
It's got her data, right?

154
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,139
I only found a few strands,
but you can use them to recover.

155
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:07,559
Mio, you're a genius!

156
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:16,151
My hair has been restored!

157
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,197
All right, let's do this.

158
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,157
Yeah.

159
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,367
Sou, take care of Mio.

160
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:27,078
Leave it to me. Don't die out there.

161
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:29,289
Shinpei.

162
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,710
I have to tell you something later...

163
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:38,882
so you have to come back in one piece.

164
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:43,595
Got it. Call me if anything happens.

165
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,598
<i>Yeah.</i>

166
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:50,894
HITOBUCHI

167
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,857
I don't sense any shadows nearby.
They're not here anymore.

168
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:02,781
Just like Ms. Nagumo said,
the Hitobuchi family has been wiped out.

169
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,747
<i>She saw the shadow of Kanae Hitobuchi,
a school teacher nicknamed "Bucchi."</i>

170
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:18,004
<i>She taught every kid on the island,
including Ushio, Ms. Nagumo, and me.</i>

171
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:27,347
There she is. Hey, look!

172
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,599
Her hair is blonde.

173
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:31,142
She's got blue eyes too.

174
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:33,311
-Creepy!
-She's a foreigner!

175
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:35,021
-You foreigner!
-You foreigner!

176
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,606
-Hey, foreigner!
-Hey!

177
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:39,651
Die!

178
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:42,612
U-Ushio...

179
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:43,571
You're not getting away!

180
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:47,242
Hey! What are you doing?

181
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:51,287
Bucchi.

182
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:53,289
NURSE'S OFFICE

183
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,167
It's not my fault.
I didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:59,546
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

185
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,256
You were just upset.

186
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:02,382
I'm not upset.

187
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:07,178
Those two bully weak kids
because they're weak.

188
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:10,598
But I'm not a weak kid.
I just taught them that.

189
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:14,310
You certainly are strong...

190
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:19,524
but violence is unacceptable.

191
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:23,737
People who are truly strong
don't hurt others.

192
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,988
What does that mean? I don't get it.

193
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:31,161
These hands of yours
are not made to hurt people.

194
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:36,624
I want you to use them
to hold hands and to hug.

195
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,336
You want me to hold hands with them?
Eww, no way!

196
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,088
Shinpei.

197
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,298
Ah, yes.

198
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:48,762
Keep a good eye on Ushio.
I'm counting on you.

199
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,221
Yes.

200
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:55,185
Next time, think about what I said
before you make a fist.

201
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,147
I can't promise that.
I'll punch back if someone punches me.

202
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:01,566
Okay.

203
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:09,407
You're so honest. I love that about you.

204
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,873
Bucchi. She was so kind.

205
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,666
I know.

206
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,628
But she was scary when she got mad.

207
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:23,588
Yeah.

208
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,010
We're the only ones
who can avenge her death.

209
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:38,728
<i>We followed the presence of shadows
into the forest of Mount Takanosu.</i>

210
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:41,272
Well? Feel anything?

211
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:44,192
Yes, I feel them more.

212
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:47,904
Be cautious. They probably sense me too.

213
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,656
Yes, I know.

214
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,659
Shinpei, are you nervous?

215
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:55,620
Of course, I am.
It's just the two of us against them.

216
00:16:55,703 --> 00:17:01,042
Don't worry, I got your back.
You just step back and relax...

217
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:03,753
Shinpei, get on.

218
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,843
G-Go away!

219
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:14,305
You've got so much energy
as always, Hamaji.

220
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,267
You'll be a tasty meal.

221
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:25,900
What? Ushio?

222
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,320
I missed one! Shinpei! Behind the kids!

223
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,874
You got so big, Shinpei.
Are you doing well?

224
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,419
Yes... Mrs. Hitobuchi.

225
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:57,473
So good shadows are fighting bad ones,
and you're a good shadow.

226
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,726
Correct answer, Todai!

227
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,689
No worries. We'll beat up
all the bad shadows.

228
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:05,899
Right, Shinpei...

229
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:07,483
Exactly!

230
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:08,860
Why are you still up there?

231
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:12,572
I can't get down! You put me here!

232
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:15,200
Shinpei really gets led around
by the nose.

233
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:16,743
Yeah! They're like a couple.

234
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:18,703
-It's not like that!
-It's not like that!

235
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:24,167
Listen, this is a secret mission,
so you can't tell any grown-ups.

236
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,543
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

237
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:26,628
Roger that!

238
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:28,588
This is so cool!

239
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:34,552
I couldn't tell the kids
that the real Bucchi was killed.

240
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,306
That's for the best.
There's no need to scare them.

241
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:41,267
Will they keep quiet about the shadows?

242
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,729
It's okay.
No one would believe them anyway.

243
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:48,441
Shinpei, there's blood. It's still fresh.

244
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,694
Did Bucchi do this?

245
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:58,576
It's a 34-year-old woman
who's not from the island.

246
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:03,039
<i>She lives in Osaka. She's a tourist.</i>

247
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:08,294
I don't see a human stain.
That tourist was taken away.

248
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:14,008
Darn it, Heine is eating more
to heal wounds from yesterday.

249
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:18,972
What a fool.
Eating more strangers won't heal her.

250
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:25,937
For both Shiori Kobayakawa and Heine,
originals no longer exist.

251
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:27,647
Ushioh?

252
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:31,109
Wait, did I just say something?

253
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:32,819
Hold on.

254
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:35,113
It's Ms. Nagumo.

255
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,741
Let's meet up with everyone
like we planned.

256
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:42,704
I'll have the kids go to Kofune.
It's safest there.

257
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:46,457
<i>Both teams met up
and reported on the situation.</i>

258
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:52,505
<i>Basically, we only defeated the shadows
of Mrs. Hitobuchi and two kids.</i>

259
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:58,177
<i>The Kogaito home had human stains,
but no shadows were present.</i>

260
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:04,934
<i>Totsumura, along with us, then checked
the shadows we fought in the gym.</i>

261
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,687
<i>All of their homes were empty,</i>

262
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:13,693
<i>but the families told neighbors
that they were leaving.</i>

263
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:15,737
For instance,

264
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,076
The Kobayakawas said that Shiori would be
recovering at a relative's house.

265
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,039
I called the relatives,
but there was no truth to that.

266
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:31,252
In the first loop, your shadow said that
they were running from debt.

267
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:32,503
Debt?

268
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:37,842
Are they trying to avoid suspicion
in case we erased them?

269
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,970
They must want the summer festival
to go on as planned tomorrow.

270
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:44,307
{\an8}It doesn't seem like
they're going to attack us.

271
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:47,935
{\an8}Are they afraid of Ushioh's hacking?

272
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:52,899
They might not show their backs
to us anymore.

273
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:58,863
So they want the festival to happen.
Can't we cancel it somehow?

274
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:05,370
To do that, we'll need to see that man.

275
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,545
<i>Looking back, I was trying to
meet him right from the start.</i>

276
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:17,924
<i>It's the first place where I was killed.</i>

277
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,347
<i>Hiruko. It's where everything began.</i>

278
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:30,978
Hello.

279
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:37,360
Oh, hello.

280
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:43,324
I wanted to talk to you, Mr. Karikiri.
Do you have time?

281
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:50,039
Of course. Why don't we talk inside?
Come with me.

282
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:24,967
