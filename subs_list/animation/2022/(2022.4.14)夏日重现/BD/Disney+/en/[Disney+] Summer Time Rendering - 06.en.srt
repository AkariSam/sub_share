<i>We hope you enjoyed your trip.
Please watch your step.</i>

00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,540
<i>That man… is a shadow.</i>

4
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:21,752
<i>It just added credibility to that message.</i>

{\an8}ORBITAL RESONANCE

6
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,566
{\an8}Welcome home, Shinpei!

7
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,402
Hey!

8
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:13,072
-Hope you had a nice trip!
-"Shinpei"?

9
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:15,157
-Shin… Shinpei?
-Leave this to me!

10
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,700
Shinpei Ajiro.

11
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:20,329
Shinpei Ajiro.

12
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:22,831
<i>That boy.</i>

13
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,792
Shinpei!

14
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,669
No, he can't be.

FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

16
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:34,218
Funeral? Kofune?

17
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,428
Ushio.

18
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,180
Ushio!

19
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:41,934
{\an8}HITOGASHIMA HALL

20
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:48,107
{\an8}It's 11:45 a.m. I'm at the funeral hall.
The deceased is Ushio Kofune.

21
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,067
I know her.

22
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:00,035
Hizuru?

23
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:03,580
Ah, I knew it was you!

24
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,167
Hizuru Minakata, right?

25
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:10,963
You have a good eye, Masahito Karikiri.

26
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:14,591
You look great. How long has it been?

27
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,553
It's been 14 years.

28
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,263
<i>He didn't flinch
when I stepped on his shadow.</i>

29
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,473
Has it been that long?

30
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:22,975
<i>He's not a shadow.</i>

31
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:27,313
Is Ushio Kofune related to Bistro Kofune?

32
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:31,483
Yes. She passed away in
an accident in the ocean yesterday.

33
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:34,945
Are you here because
you heard about Ushio?

34
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:36,363
No.

35
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:40,659
Oh, then why are you here?
You're not back for good, are you?

36
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,369
No, I live in Tokyo and…

37
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:46,832
Wait! Let me guess!
You were always smart, so…

38
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:49,335
-you must be like a lawyer,
-Now I remember.

39
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:52,921
-or a doctor?
-I could never stand you.

40
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:55,215
Turns out I still can't.

41
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:58,886
Always the jokester.

42
00:03:58,969 --> 00:03:59,803
It is no joke!

43
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:01,889
Oh, Alain.

44
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:04,808
Remember her?

45
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:06,352
Don't be too shocked.

46
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:09,521
-This is…
-I am Hizuru Minakata.

47
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:12,024
Come on! Let me say it!

48
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:14,693
Hizuru? That Hizuru?

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,405
Long time no see, Alain.

50
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,283
<i>It was my second year in junior high.</i>

51
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,535
BISTRO KOFUNE

52
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:29,208
<i>I went to Bistro Kofune often.</i>

53
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,254
<i>Alain had two daughters, Ushio and Mio.</i>

54
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:37,674
<i>Alain's wife died soon after
giving birth to Mio.</i>

55
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:42,888
<i>While Alain worked,
customers looked after the girls.</i>

56
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,349
Read me this picture book!

57
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,433
<i>KEEPER AT THE SEX ZOO
TAMING THE GIRLS</i>

58
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:47,810
This is not a picture book.

59
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:50,270
You shouldn't read that!

60
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:54,858
Why? Not fair! Read it to me!

61
00:04:55,526 --> 00:05:00,948
Then do you wanna hear
one of my epic original stories?

62
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:03,909
Huh? Original?

63
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:06,286
Oh! How lucky, Ushio.

64
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,122
Hizuru's newest work.

65
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:12,251
Long time ago, on an island…

66
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,298
<i>Death comes to all.</i>

67
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:24,388
<i>Ryunosuke, it's been 14 years.</i>

68
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:29,351
<i>Enough time has passed
for another to have died.</i>

69
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:32,688
What? You fell?

70
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:34,273
What's the matter?

71
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:37,943
Mio and Shinpei fell into the ocean.

72
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:39,820
They will be a little late.

73
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:43,490
Oh, no. Let's wait a bit then.

74
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:46,660
Alain, who's this "Shinpei"?

75
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:51,248
Ah, you don't know him since
he came after you left the island.

76
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:56,879
His name is Shinpei Ajiro,
my friend's son whom I took in.

77
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:01,300
<i>Shinpei Ajiro.</i>

78
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:06,472
Was it ten years ago?
He lost his parents in a boat accident.

79
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,016
He didn't have any relatives.

80
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,517
Excuse me.

81
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,436
Oh, Hizuru.

82
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:15,272
That's…

83
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:26,158
<i>The boy who sat in front of me
on the ferry was Shinpei Ajiro.</i>

84
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:35,626
<i>I can't meet him.
I can't trust anyone yet.</i>

85
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,002
Wait, Hizuru!

86
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:39,838
Ligature marks?

87
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:46,803
They said it looked like
someone strangled her and she resisted.

88
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:50,307
Wait a second, Alain.
Are the police idiots?

89
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:55,812
The culprit's blood or skin is often left
under the victim's fingernails.

90
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:59,233
Did they check her fingernails?

91
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:01,026
N… No…

92
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:02,903
Unbelievable.

93
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,699
Doesn't this remind you of that time?

94
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:13,872
It's like 14 years ago,
when Ryunosuke died.

95
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:20,420
Ryunosuke! Heine!

96
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:21,922
Move!

97
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:25,842
Why?

98
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:28,762
Hey!

99
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:34,685
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

100
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:35,978
Get off me, idiot!

101
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,564
The heck? I'll arrest you.

102
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:42,067
<i>Nothing seems unusual
at first glance. But…</i>

103
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,701
Who did the makeup for this body?

104
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:55,664
Umm… a nurse at the Hishigata Clinic.

105
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:59,126
What is this?
This is a disrespect to the deceased.

106
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:03,338
It's okay, doctor. She is a friend.

107
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:06,049
Who is really disrespectful?

108
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:09,761
Hizuru.

109
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,307
Hizuru.

110
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:17,019
Sorry to cause a scene. I'll be going.

111
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:22,149
It was because I said all that nonsense.
Just forget about it.

112
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:26,028
I have one last question.

113
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:31,783
Did Ushio mention her doppelgänger
before she died?

114
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:33,577
Doppel…

115
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,494
Hizuru?

116
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,295
Isokone… Asako Isokone.

117
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:46,214
I always wanted to get in touch with you…

118
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:50,135
but you never gave me
your address or number.

119
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,304
Are you doing well?

120
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:57,726
Depends on how you define "well,"
but my heart is still beating.

121
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:00,812
You haven't changed at all.

122
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,732
<i>Do you remember Ushio?</i>

123
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:04,650
Yeah.

124
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:08,945
At the wake yesterday,
we got together and remembered her,

125
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:10,989
like how I always changed her diapers.

126
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:15,452
Why… Why did this happen?

127
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:19,915
Ushio saved my daughter's life.

128
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:24,127
Asako, that's who Ushio was.

129
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:27,339
All that matters is that Shiori is safe.

130
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:32,260
<i>What is it crying about?</i>

131
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:35,722
<i>This hideous acting makes me sick.</i>

132
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,767
<i>Damn shadow.</i>

133
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:41,144
Asako.

134
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,570
<i>Asako is probably dead already.</i>

135
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:57,577
<i>"Ushio saved my daughter's life"?
Unforgivable.</i>

136
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:06,086
<i>How dare you pose as Asako
and disrespect Alain and Ushio!</i>

137
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:17,347
<i>All three Kobayakawas are shadows?</i>

138
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:22,769
Yes. No doubt about it.
I confirmed it myself.

139
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,355
The shadows are multiplying.

140
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:29,985
Seems like one of them
can create more shadows.

141
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:34,948
The shadows I know can't do that.

142
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,284
What is happening on this island?

143
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:40,746
Who knows? No clue.

144
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:48,086
How about this theory?
A shadow attacks Shiori in the water.

145
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:55,594
<i>It kills and erases Shiori,
then poses as the vulnerable girl.</i>

146
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,054
<i>Then it was saved by Mio.</i>

147
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:05,645
After that, it kills Shiori's parents
and replaces them with shadows.

148
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,651
You're crying?

149
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:15,280
It's gonna snow tomorrow.

150
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,365
It never snows in mid summer!

151
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:18,283
Ow.

152
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,204
If anything, it will rain…

153
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:26,750
but the forecast is sunny tomorrow.

154
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:29,169
Get your facts straight.

155
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:31,630
What is this?

156
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:36,885
My secondary cell phone.
Let me know if it rings.

157
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,056
I need you to do something for me.

158
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,531
{\an8}HITOGASHIMA HALL

159
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:02,494
<i>I'm going to follow my memory
and repeat the funeral like last time.</i>

160
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:05,580
<i>Same movements. Same conversations.</i>

161
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:13,797
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

162
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,385
Shiori. Did you see a girl
who looked just like you?

163
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,597
Be careful. That might be a monster
called a shadow.

164
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:28,895
Stay away from her
if you see her again, okay?

165
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:31,898
<i>I repeat everything…</i>

166
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,610
<i>and just as I thought,
Shiori doesn't do anything to me.</i>

167
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,032
<i>We see the coffin off at 1:00 p.m.</i>

168
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:44,160
<i>Good. Everything is going well.</i>

169
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,371
Hey, Shinpei.

170
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:55,130
Did Mio tell you that Shiori saw a shadow?

171
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,758
Oh, yes. When Mio was little…

172
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:02,554
<i>These two…</i>

173
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:06,349
Shinpei?

174
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:10,854
Ah, yes. When she was little,
her grandma told her about it.

175
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:12,814
Sorry I said something strange.

176
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:14,691
Asako, let's go.

177
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,692
Okay.

178
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:18,111
<i>It can't be…</i>

179
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,533
<i>Are all three of them shadows?</i>

180
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:30,040
<i>So the real ones are already…
Where are you, Ms. Nagumo?</i>

181
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,375
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

182
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:35,420
Shinpei.

183
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,213
Are you okay?

184
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:41,843
Mio, can I ask you something?

185
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:47,182
Were you wearing white panties yesterday?

186
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:52,479
That's the first thing you ask me
after being away for two years?

187
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:55,357
I am in dire need to know the color
of your panties yesterday.

188
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,817
What happened to you, Shinpei?

189
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:02,781
<i>I happened to see when Mio's shadow
killed me in the second loop.</i>

190
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,617
<i>The shadow wore white panties.</i>

191
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:08,036
<i>This morning, Mio's panties were not.</i>

192
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:12,165
Yesterday after the wake, I changed.

193
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:17,629
Uh, yes… they were white, but so what?

194
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:23,093
<i>Mio was copied yesterday.
I can't prevent that.</i>

195
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:26,805
<i>I have to kill it.
It's the only way to protect Mio.</i>

196
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:36,398
So you don't know either, Dad?

197
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:40,819
I'm really wondering
where you could have gone…

198
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:43,446
Sis.

199
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:49,786
<i>It's 1:30 p.m. Ushio's coffin is cremated.</i>

200
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:54,290
<i>After that, we have lunch
while waiting to pick up the ashes.</i>

201
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:58,837
<i>There are two questions
I want to ask certain people.</i>

202
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:03,133
<i>Question 1: Do you know
about the shadow sickness?</i>

203
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,343
Huh? Like in the ghost stories?

204
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,888
Someone just asked me something similar.

205
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:15,353
Of course. My great-grandfather was
the one who named it "shadow sickness."

206
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:21,067
It is true that a type of mental illness
did occur among groups.

207
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,197
<i>Question 2: Did you see a busty woman?</i>

208
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:29,409
I saw her! She's got a G…

209
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:32,495
Are you talking about Hizuru?

210
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,456
No idea.

211
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:41,880
Shinpei, you know Hizuru?
She used to come to our place a lot.

212
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,506
Huh? Our place?

213
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,508
<i>How did we never cross paths?</i>

214
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:48,595
By the way, Shinpei.
Can you take a look at this?

215
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:52,515
I asked Hizuru for her number,
but she gave me this.

216
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,310
I can't figure it out.

217
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:59,481
<i>Ms. Nagumo's contact info.</i>

218
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:00,899
Th-This is…

219
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:03,443
Excuse me, Shinpei.
I need to use the bathroom.

220
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,404
<i>This code is…</i>

221
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:12,368
Tamam Shud, the unbreakable code
in Ms. Nagumo's novel <i>Drifting Ashore</i>.

222
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,220
OUT OF ORDER

223
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,853
Hello? Ms. Nagumo?

224
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:42,315
Huh? Who's this?

225
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,612
-Umm, this is Shinpei Ajiro.
-<i>It's not Ms. Nagumo.</i>

226
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,405
You?

227
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:52,909
<i>I see. It was faster than I thought.</i>

228
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:56,746
This is Nezu. Ginjiro Nezu.

229
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,708
Ms. Nagumo is an acquaintance of mine.

230
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,921
How did you get this number?

231
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,007
<i>Ms. Nagumo gave Alain this number in code.</i>

232
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:10,969
<i>Did you break it?</i>

233
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:15,557
Y-Yes. There was a similar
code in one of her books.

234
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:19,477
<i>I see. You're at the crematory?</i>

235
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,187
Yes.

236
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:26,401
Leave and go to the funeral hall. Alone.

237
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,029
I'll contact you later.

238
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:32,407
Uh, excuse me! Hello…

239
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:46,713
OUT OF ORDER

240
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,144
Huh? It opens…

241
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,313
What the?

242
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,569
Ah. Hello? Mr. Nezu? I'm here.

243
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,739
<i>What should I do now?</i>

244
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:19,412
Don't move. Just stand there
like a scarecrow.

245
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:20,997
It will be over soon.

246
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,915
<i>What?</i>

247
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,416
Okay.

248
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:36,262
Time and place.
You would attack when Alain is alone.

249
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,265
I predicted 17 different patterns.

250
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:41,976
But you chose the bathroom…

251
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:46,439
Why are you here? This is the men's…

252
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,488
Normal, huh.

253
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:58,993
<i>Such a huge sound from the next stall!
What the heck?</i>

254
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,209
GINJIRO NEZU

255
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:10,380
<i>I can finally meet Ms. Nagumo.</i>

256
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,506
NEZU: HIZURU WILL MEET YOU
AT THE FORT NO. 4 RUINS

257
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,220
If you really can go back…

258
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:21,808
tell me your name, and I will save you.

259
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:26,396
<i>If we work together from the first day,
we can kill Mio's shadow.</i>

260
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:33,361
<i>How does she know about shadows?
I have so many questions.</i>

261
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:40,326
Hello, Mr. Nezu.

262
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:44,872
Huh? This is the first time we've met.

263
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:50,712
Oh, yes! You found out
about the shadows too?

264
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:56,050
If you have questions, answer mine first.

265
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:04,267
To break the code, you need to know
Ryunosuke Nagumo and her real name.

266
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:10,398
But Hizuru hasn't told anyone
that she is Ryunosuke Nagumo.

267
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:17,488
So, the only one who can call this number
is Hizuru's shadow.

268
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,782
But, you are human.

269
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:24,912
Ms. Nagumo!

270
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,877
So…

271
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,007
It's S-H-I-N-P-E-I A-J-I-R-O.

272
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,803
Please make it out to Shinpei Ajiro!
I'd like your autograph.

273
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,139
Well… what I mean is…

274
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:47,352
I am a huge fan! I have all your books!

275
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,145
<i>I told you my name like you asked.</i>

276
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,190
<i>Even as I step back from myself,
I sound like such a dork.</i>

277
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:54,650
<i>Okay. What next?</i>

278
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:59,906
Is this the time for that?
You aren't normal.

279
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:04,327
Lord Byron said,
"Truth is stranger than fiction."

280
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,290
{\an8}I don't like fantasy,
but after analyzing all possibilities,

281
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:11,584
{\an8}I came to this conclusion.

282
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,502
{\an8}TO SHINPEI AJIRO
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO

283
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,548
Ah… Thank you.

284
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:21,594
Feel free to tell me
if anything I say is incorrect.

285
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:25,098
On the ferry this morning,
you didn't know me.

286
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:29,811
No one knows who I am unless I tell them.

287
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:32,355
I never told you who I was.

288
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:38,403
This is not the first time
you are living July 22nd.

289
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,739
You must have repeated the day many times.

290
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:49,580
In other words, you are a time traveler.

291
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:54,502
Yes.

292
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,051
