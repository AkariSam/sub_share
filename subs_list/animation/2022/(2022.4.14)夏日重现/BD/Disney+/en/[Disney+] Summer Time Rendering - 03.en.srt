1
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:06,862
It sounds ridiculous.

2
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:11,117
But once you see it…

3
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,539
the shadows are taking over people.

4
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:23,129
We need to warn Shiori!

5
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:26,841
The shadows are coming to kill,
and it isn't a superstition!

6
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,301
She's in danger!

7
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:34,598
<i>Shiori Kobayakawa also saw her shadow.
She's in danger.</i>

8
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:37,101
Let's go to her place now!

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,145
<i>But…</i>

10
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,482
<i>I cannot let Mio get
anywhere near that danger.</i>

11
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:45,818
I'm going alone.

{\an8}DRIFTING ASHORE

00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:26,585
KOBA MART
YOMOGIMOCHI

14
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:38,347
<i>The store is closed.
This is bad. Nothing changed.</i>

15
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,348
Hey!

16
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,141
Is that you, Shinpei?

17
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,060
Mrs. Shiomi!

18
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:45,145
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:48,190
Aw, thank you. Uh… Good morning.

20
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,153
We have no convenience stores here.
It's not like Tokyo, eh?

21
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,117
Well, I like this store.
They have green tea ice cream.

22
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,661
A little taste of home?

23
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,913
It looks closed today, though.

24
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:07,501
That's odd.
They never said they'd be closed.

25
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:09,128
{\an8}3RD GRADE, CLASS 1 SHIORI KOBAYAKAWA

26
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,550
Hey, Koba? Open up!

27
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,469
That's strange. Are they out?

28
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:22,766
They left it open. Koba? Are you there?

29
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,978
Is it okay to go in like this?

30
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:26,937
Don't worry.

31
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:28,814
Koba?

32
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:37,781
Huh? They even left the TV on.

33
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:44,913
Koba?

34
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:47,833
Koba?

35
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:54,298
This is weird. Koba!

36
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,759
<i>Shadows.</i>

37
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,011
<i>Shadows did this.</i>

38
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,349
<i>Totsumura's shadow did the same to him.</i>

39
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:08,562
<i>Didn't you anticipate this?
You could have done something.</i>

40
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,273
<i>You could have saved them.</i>

41
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,942
<i>Stop it! They're monsters.</i>

42
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:16,445
<i>I refuse to get killed again.</i>

43
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:22,326
<i>All I can do is warn people
and closely observe things.</i>

44
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:26,914
<i>So what did you find out from observing?</i>

45
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:34,421
<i>The food is untouched and cold.
They were probably attacked yesterday…</i>

46
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:35,923
<i>at dinnertime.</i>

47
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:46,058
<i>There are marks on the floor as if
someone punched it with great force.</i>

48
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,524
<i>What happened here?</i>

49
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,030
Mrs. Shiomi, I'm going to look upstairs.

50
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:02,408
Okay! Thanks!

51
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,791
<i>Judging from the size of the two
dark stains, they must have been adults.</i>

52
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,002
<i>Probably Shiori's parents.</i>

53
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:18,006
<i>Then where is Shiori?</i>

54
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,028
Hey.

55
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:42,781
<i>Ah! That's it.</i>

56
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,288
Did you see a girl
who looked just like you?

57
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,585
Why did you ask me that yesterday?

58
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:58,255
<i>It's something I didn't do last time.</i>

59
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:09,391
You kept staring.
Was something on my face?

60
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:13,896
Or was there something weird
about my body?

61
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:15,981
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

62
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,608
Shiori.

63
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:23,113
<i>The shadow at the funeral was
Shiori Kobayakawa.</i>

64
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:27,326
You got your voice back! Are you better?

65
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,787
<i>That was such a stupid question.</i>

66
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,789
Oh…

67
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,419
Papa and Mama told me not to say anything.

68
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:42,174
Are you going to answer… uh, never mind.

69
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:48,388
No need to answer.

70
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,145
I'll ask later.

71
00:06:57,064 --> 00:07:00,234
<i>I caught the shadow sickness.</i>

72
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:01,151
<i>No…</i>

73
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:06,823
<i>I had it from the beginning!</i>

74
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,117
Shinpei!

75
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:13,038
So? Is anyone up here?

76
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:29,888
What is it? You have a stomachache?

77
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,014
No.

78
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:35,936
<i>I guess Mrs. Shiomi just saved my life.</i>

79
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:45,445
<i>After Mrs. Shiomi called the police,
I left the Kobayakawa home.</i>

80
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,243
<i>If I do nothing until noon,
the same thing will happen.</i>

81
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:56,915
<i>That woman who I met on the ferry
knows something.</i>

82
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,169
<i>Maybe I can save her.</i>

83
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:05,465
<i>I haven't seen her this time…</i>

84
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,343
<i>because the day started at the port.</i>

85
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:15,892
<i>She had too much luggage for a day trip.</i>

86
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,980
<i>I'll check the hotels on the island.</i>

87
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:24,568
A suit?

88
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,654
Yes. She was wearing a suit,
and had long hair.

89
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:29,281
Well…

90
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,074
She had glasses.

91
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:32,492
Oh…

92
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:34,036
Have you seen her?

93
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:38,999
I'm not sure.
Many guests come this season.

94
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,877
Also…

95
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,547
She had huge… well…

96
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:47,257
Ah! Her!

97
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,719
I remember her! She came here.

98
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:53,055
You asked me this morning.

99
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:56,558
You were looking for this woman
with glasses and big boobs.

100
00:08:56,642 --> 00:08:57,476
<i>Huh?</i>

101
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,187
But she didn't stay overnight.

102
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,816
She just came to the cafe
in the late afternoon.

103
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,779
You should check out our cafe too.

104
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:14,826
<i>In the end,
that woman didn't stay anywhere…</i>

105
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,788
<i>and I couldn't find her.</i>

106
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,750
<i>Maybe there's not much I can do alone.</i>

107
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,087
BISTRO KOFUNE

108
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,215
{\an8}LUNCH SPECIALS

109
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,926
Welcome…

110
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:35,847
Shinpei, how was it? How is Shiori?

111
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,474
Oh… yeah.

112
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:38,809
Ah!

113
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:40,268
Welcome!

114
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:41,561
<i>Totsumura.</i>

115
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:44,314
It's so damn hot… Hey!

116
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:48,777
Shinpei! What's with that call last night?
You lied!

117
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,986
What violent outburst…

118
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,782
Your usual Lunch Special
with fried shrimp and medium rice?

119
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,034
You know me well.

120
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:59,454
Huh? Disappeared?

121
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,833
The entire Kobayakawa family?

122
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,042
Yup.

123
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,794
Really? Shinpei?

124
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:06,878
Yes.

125
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:10,048
I heard you went inside with Mrs. Shiomi.

126
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,466
Oh… yes.

127
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,844
Tell me about it later.

128
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:19,433
That's odd.
I just talked to Kobayakawa yesterday.

129
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:23,812
Right? I really can't go into details yet…

130
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:27,149
but a detective is coming
on the first ferry this afternoon.

131
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,860
<i>His response is different.</i>

132
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:35,240
<i>Good, it's probably because
I stopped his shadow from killing him.</i>

133
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:37,075
<i>This is the real Totsumura!</i>

134
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:42,038
Oh yeah, I had to give you this. Here.

135
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:51,798
That's my sister's.

136
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:57,596
Ushio came to see me
the day before she died…

137
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,891
and she asked me to keep it for her.

138
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:05,854
She said to give it to you
if anything happened to her.

139
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:08,940
Ushio left this for me?

140
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:12,235
It was like she knew…

141
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:15,906
what would happen to her.

142
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:19,659
<i>Things are intricately complex.</i>

143
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:30,670
Hi Shinpei. Sorry, was I too early?

144
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:33,381
No, I was waiting for you.

145
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:38,553
<i>I can trust Sou. I'll tell him everything.</i>

146
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:46,061
So that's why I think…

147
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:52,400
You think Shiori's shadow
killed Ushio, right?

148
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:54,528
Ah, yes.

149
00:11:55,737 --> 00:12:01,701
The ligature marks tell she was strangled,
and only one person was with her.

150
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:07,165
Is it after Mio next?

151
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:08,583
Yes.

152
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:14,714
Can we tell shadows apart from people
just by looking at them?

153
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:16,508
No.

154
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,386
I couldn't tell the difference.

155
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:24,474
I see. That bothers me.

156
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:31,982
So, you might be a shadow yourself.

157
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:41,032
Yes, but the same goes for you.

158
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:46,162
What are they? What are shadows?

159
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,539
Calm down, Mio.

160
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:48,790
It'll be okay.

161
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:57,507
Cameras can film them,
so they are living things, not ghosts.

162
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:04,347
If they're alive, there must be
a way to kill them, right?

163
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:06,558
That's true.

164
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:10,228
Shinpei, why don't we go to Hiruko now?

165
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:14,482
Mr. Karikiri should know well
about the history of this island.

166
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,235
He might also know about shadows.

167
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:23,408
<i>That's right, Mio and I were trying
to visit Hiruko the first time too.</i>

168
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:29,331
<i>But it's too dangerous!
We ran into it near the shrine.</i>

169
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:33,627
Ah! Maybe tomorrow?

170
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:37,756
Tomorrow? It's the summer festival.

171
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,342
Ah… the summer festival.

172
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:42,928
I figured you forgot.

173
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:47,766
Tomorrow is the busiest day
of the year for the shrine.

174
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:50,518
The priest won't have time for us.

175
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:56,191
<i>Actually, the more people,
the safer it should be.</i>

176
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,569
<i>The festival is a perfect time
to visit Hiruko.</i>

177
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:03,865
I'll come to Kofune at five tomorrow.

178
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:10,163
Let's decide on a secret code
so that I can tell if you're a shadow.

179
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:11,081
Okay.

180
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:13,041
If I say "mountain," you say…

181
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:13,959
"River"?

182
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:15,794
Idiot. That's too obvious.

183
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,505
Well… how about "Tigris-Euphrates Rivers"?

184
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,966
Forget rivers for a moment, Shinpei.

185
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,634
"Mesopotamian civilization"?

186
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:23,927
Nice one, Mio!

187
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,804
"Mesopotamian civilization!"

188
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:27,889
<i>Are these two serious?</i>

189
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:30,225
Thanks Sou.

190
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,811
For trusting what I said.

191
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:39,901
We're buddies.
You trusted me enough to tell me too.

192
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,821
<i>Don't completely trust him yet.</i>

193
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:46,700
<i>Not until you find a way
to tell shadows apart from people.</i>

194
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,326
<i>Why am I so negative?</i>

195
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,244
Right.

196
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:53,331
By the way, there's something
I want to check out.

197
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,668
I'll let you know if I find anything.

198
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,564
Jeez! We're getting soaked!

199
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:31,327
This wasn't in the forecast.

200
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,638
{\an8}HITO SUMMER FESTIVAL
JULY 24, 2018

201
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:52,307
Shinpei.

202
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah?

203
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,853
How long will you stay here?

204
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:59,731
Oh, well…

205
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:04,444
I wanted to leave shortly
after the funeral, but now…

206
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:10,033
You should stay forever.

207
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,287
Forever?

208
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:19,751
Never mind. I didn't mean it.

209
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:23,171
I was just kidding. Give me your hand.

210
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:24,923
Here, take this.

211
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,760
Sis was wearing this necklace
when she died.

212
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:33,223
She would've wanted you to have it.

213
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:37,727
Oh… thanks.

214
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:58,123
<i>Her birthday.</i>

215
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,666
INPUT PASSWORD

216
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:00,583
PASSWORD INCORRECT

217
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:02,794
<i>Not that.</i>

218
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:03,711
JULY 24

219
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:08,133
Mountain.

220
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,266
You have to say
"Mesopotamian civilizaton," remember?

221
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,685
Ah. It's time already.

222
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:22,730
You're such a party-pooper.
It's got to be the real you.

223
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:25,775
Shinpei! Put on some pants!

224
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,944
Sorry! Tokiko!

225
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,992
Please change quickly.
We're all ready. Right, Mio?

226
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,336
D-Do I look okay?

227
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:49,591
I've never worn a <i>yukata</i> before.

228
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:51,092
You look…

229
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:53,178
You look great!

230
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:57,265
How is it? Tokiko dressed her.

231
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,019
It might help to tell us apart
from the fakes.

232
00:18:01,102 --> 00:18:02,896
Th-That's true.

233
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:03,813
How is it?

234
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,149
I haven't told Tokiko anything yet.

235
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,610
-It looks great.
-Right. That's for the best.

236
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:12,822
By the way, what were you
looking into yesterday?

237
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:14,574
Did you find anything?

238
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,327
Oh, that?

239
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,747
It was nothing important.
Just forget about it.

240
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:26,628
Let's quit chatting and go.
Ushio must be waiting.

241
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:32,550
Sis was really looking forward
to this festival.

242
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:34,677
I'm sure she'll be there somehow.

243
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:37,889
Come on, let's go. For her soul.

244
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:44,562
<i>Sou, didn't you want to become a doctor?
You sound so unscientific.</i>

245
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:57,450
HITO SHRINE

246
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,537
{\an8}GYOKURINEN GREEN TEA ICE CREAM

247
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,627
Hey, Sou.

248
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,045
Yeah?

249
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,007
It's been two years
since I left the island.

250
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:17,470
I thought I had matured a bit…

251
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,098
but I'm still totally helpless.

252
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:24,727
I wasn't with her when
she really needed me.

253
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:29,274
I promised I would protect her.

254
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:32,694
You fool!

255
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:36,281
Ushio died, but not because of you!

256
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:41,119
Keep it together, Shinpei!
Focus on protecting Mio now!

257
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,579
You're her brother!

258
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,082
I don't need you to tell me that!

259
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:56,217
If you aren't up for the job,
leave Mio to me.

260
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:02,515
{\an8}Sou, you still have feelings for Mio?

261
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,311
Do you have a problem with that?

262
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:10,273
What are you chatting about?

263
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,234
Ah, nothing.

264
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,778
We were debating
whether we liked boobs or butts.

265
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:16,696
Hey!

266
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,531
-Ugh, that's creepy.
-No!

267
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,867
Shinpei, your ice cream is melting.

268
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:24,412
I'm telling you, he's lying!

269
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:27,874
Actually, I am sort of curious.

270
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,083
What?

271
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:34,255
You were peeping on Mio when she was
in the bath the other day, Shinpei.

272
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:38,718
What? What the hell!

273
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,720
-Wait! It's not what it sounds like.
-Take this!

274
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:44,432
Shinpei, what do you really think
about Mio?

275
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:47,435
Ah! What are you saying, Tokiko?

276
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:53,149
What I think of her?

277
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:58,738
Of course, I care about her.

278
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,449
We're family.

279
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,036
Family, huh?

280
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,332
Stop, Tokiko! Don't ask him weird things.

281
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,461
Shinpei, my old man just called.

282
00:21:13,544 --> 00:21:16,881
After the fireworks and the Omiokuri…

283
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:19,050
Mr. Karikiri will be available.

284
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:22,136
Okay. So until then…

285
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:30,853
What's up, Shinpei?

286
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,689
Over there, I just saw…

287
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:38,528
Why don't we go into the grounds
and see the fireworks from there?

288
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:42,532
Sorry. I'll catch up with you.

289
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:48,746
H-Hey! Shinpei!

290
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,206
Look after Mio!

291
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,043
Where is he going? Taking a dump?

292
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:58,589
Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry.

293
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:04,762
<i>Ushio must be waiting.</i>

294
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,476
<i>Sis was really looking forward to
this festival.</i>

295
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,854
<i>I'm sure she'll be there somehow.</i>

296
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,754
<i>Hey, Shinpei.</i>

297
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:51,559
<i>Find me.</i>

298
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,324
<i>Ushio.</i>

299
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,968
