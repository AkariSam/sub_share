1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:03,275
JULY 22
(FIFTH LOOP)

2
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:11,742
Ushio?

3
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:13,244
Hizuru!

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,040
Thank goodness, you're alive again!

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,377
Wait, Nezu! Let me explain!

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,049
Kofune's daughter died yesterday!
You're with the shadows after all!

7
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:29,510
Stop, Nezu. Don't rush to judgment.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,348
I died?

9
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:37,685
Yes.

10
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:41,814
I see.

11
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:47,528
The world you observe becomes reality.
Four-Arm said that.

12
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:52,116
Yes. But why do I have that power?

13
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:55,995
If your right eye belonged to Heine…

14
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,374
that eye is made of shadows.

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,919
You don't remember when it was printed?

16
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:09,884
I'm not sure, but probably
after I came back to the island.

17
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:15,097
I see. Every piece fits now.

18
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:19,393
The one who gave that eye to Shinpei
was you, Ushioh.

19
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:22,062
Me?

20
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:23,772
How?

21
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,652
Why do you think you failed the last loop?

22
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:35,034
One was acting separately from you
after defeating Mio's shadow.

23
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,495
This time, we need to work together.

24
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,538
Hey…

25
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:41,207
I agree.

26
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,666
Hey, Hizuru.

27
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,226
T-That was…

28
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:05,481
Nezu, Ushioh is an ally.
She was our ally till the end.

29
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,525
<i>Ms. Nagumo. Can you hear me?</i>

30
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:13,697
That's why we have that message
and Shinpei's right eye here.

31
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:15,532
I trust you.

32
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:17,826
Ms. Nagumo.

33
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:25,292
It's human nature to believe in fiction.
Let it be riches, religion, or stories.

34
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,920
That's why I'm a novelist.

35
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:31,423
I'm not fictional.

36
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,384
I know.

37
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:36,053
<i>That's the first time I saw her smile.</i>

38
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:40,516
Jeez… So you're risking your lives too?

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,562
Is Four-Arm trying to revive Heine?

40
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:50,526
It fed a lot of people to Heine
at the summer festival.

41
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,862
What happens after that ceremony?

42
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,198
Something about an "Ending…"

43
00:02:56,282 --> 00:03:00,202
<i>That massive body is Hiruko's true form.</i>

44
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,956
The shadow at Shiori's feet
is just part of that.

45
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:08,419
That explains why
we couldn't kill Shiori no matter what.

46
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:13,507
But Shiori isn't strong in battle.
She walks, and that's it.

47
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:17,636
Hiruko is too weak to leave the cave.

48
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,972
Could this be it?

49
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:24,184
{\an8}-HEINE IS IMMOBILE (WEAK LEGS)
-TRUE FORM (HIRUKO) IS WEAK AND IMMOBILE

50
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:26,353
{\an8}-SHIORI IS MOBILE
-FOOT SHADOW IS PART OF TRUE FORM

51
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:27,604
{\an8}SHIORI IS AT THE FUNERAL NOW

52
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:29,606
What is your plan?

53
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,111
<i>I'd like to go underground now
and defeat the true form…</i>

54
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:39,408
<i>but if we can't defeat Four-Arm,
it'll end up like the last loop.</i>

55
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:46,290
Moreover, I'm worried about Mio.
I need a plan about Sou too.

56
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:51,920
I want us to capture Shiori
at Koba Mart like last time.

57
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,759
You can't kill her, though.
What's the point of capturing her?

58
00:03:56,925 --> 00:04:00,179
Right, but I might be able to erase her.

59
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,900
{\an8}FRIEND

60
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,946
Yeah, I feel better than I did yesterday.

61
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,785
It's because Shinpei's back.

62
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,122
I see.

63
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,627
Oh, what's wrong, Sou?

64
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:59,506
I need to talk to Father about Ushio.

65
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,885
Leave. I don't have time for that.

66
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:04,470
Seido.

67
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:05,929
Don't worry about him.

68
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:09,266
Make some time for him, will you?

69
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,688
Negoro. Take care of the rest.

70
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:20,402
Father!

71
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:27,075
Come to my room tonight at 10.
I'll spare five minutes.

72
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:32,414
Thanks, Mother.

73
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:35,375
Sure, but what is it about?

74
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,836
Nothing much.

75
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,009
Yes. Shinpei Ajiro is looking into
the shadow sickness.

76
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:50,015
What's going on? It was Ushio Kofune,
now it's Hizuru Minakata.

77
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:53,977
Why are people sniffing around now?

78
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:59,149
<i>It's unlikely a coincidence
that Hizuru Minakata returned.</i>

79
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:03,028
<i>Ushio must have contacted Shinpei.</i>

80
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:09,159
Is it true that Ushio's shadow
wasn't erased and is now missing?

81
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:15,290
<i>Don't worry. We'll find and erase it.
First, we'll get to her family.</i>

82
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:17,376
Turn the entire Kofune family
into shadows?

83
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,547
<i>That's the plan. Including Shinpei Ajiro.</i>

84
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,342
<i>Well? What is it? Yes, I'll be there.</i>

85
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:30,097
<i>Hello? My mother needs me. I must go.</i>

86
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,270
Mama's boy.

87
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:39,356
<i>Today, we have a report
from Kinokawa City.</i>

88
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,485
<i>Wakayama's seasonal treats are delicious…</i>

89
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:44,736
KOBA MART
YOMOGIMOCHI

90
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:52,828
<i>You're up, Ryunosuke.</i>

91
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,747
Erase Shiori?

92
00:07:55,831 --> 00:08:01,461
In the last loop, I felt Heine coming in
and trying to mess with my head.

93
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,423
So maybe I can reverse that route.

94
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:06,675
Can you do the same?

95
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,554
I don't get it,
but it seems like it's worth trying.

96
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:14,850
Yes. I would like to
put it down myself, though.

97
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,686
Nezu told me last time.

98
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:22,232
Ryunosuke was killed by a shadow
14 years ago…

99
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,361
and there were ligature marks on his neck.

100
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:30,490
Did Heine kill Ryunosuke?

101
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:35,203
Yes. And she was my friend.

102
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:36,997
-What…
-Your friend?

103
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:40,125
Ah. It's Mio.

104
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,503
Pick it up. We can talk more later.

105
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,590
I wanna hear Mio's voice!
Should I pick it up?

106
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:47,883
Dummy!

107
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:50,010
I was just joking.

108
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:55,515
<i>She's alive. The phone is vibrating
to tell me she's alive.</i>

109
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:58,977
<i>-I won't let Mio die again.
-Hello? Sorry.</i>

110
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:03,857
<i>Repeating the previous actions
should yield the same result.</i>

111
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:06,777
<i>So Plan B is to capture Heine.</i>

112
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:12,324
<i>Heine is the one who took you
and Asako from me.</i>

113
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:17,204
<i>If it weren't for Heine, Ushio Kofune
and the others would still be alive.</i>

114
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:19,414
Let's end this, Ryunosuke.

115
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,335
Roger that, Sis.

116
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,470
Are you ready?

117
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,806
I've been ready before you were even born.

118
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,766
I'm good to go.

119
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:44,523
<i>Erase Heine, whom Four-Arm treasures.
Here and now.</i>

120
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:48,485
<i>Then we'll save everyone
from the end of that summer festival.</i>

121
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,529
Hi! Hizuru!

122
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:55,492
Hey, did I catch you at dinner…
Excuse me, I had some gifts.

123
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,453
Oh! You shouldn't have!

124
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,664
Come in.

125
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:02,124
Thank you.

126
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:14,845
No one is looking.
You can come out, Ushioh.

127
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,931
Whoopsie.

128
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:22,728
You transform, you fight.
You're like <i>Pretty Cure</i>.

129
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:28,191
What? Really?
That was my dream in kindergarten!

130
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:29,985
You know <i>Pretty Cure</i>?

131
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:31,903
My granddaughter used to like it.

132
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:34,489
Ah, this is great, Shinpei.

133
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,658
I realized something amazing!

134
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,794
The nail gun that Four-Arm destroyed?

135
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:50,922
Oh, wow. So this means…

136
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:55,385
you can bring the data you scanned
the last time to the next loop!

137
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:56,386
Isn't it great?

138
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,267
{\an8}Yes! You're amazing, Ushioh!
Was that outfit scanned last time too?

139
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,811
{\an8}PARISIENNE

140
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:08,356
It's too bad, though.
I wish this wasn't damaged.

141
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,025
It should be fine…

142
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:13,195
since I have the original.

143
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:18,992
<i>Nezu brought two guns:
his Nail Gun A and my Nail Gun B.</i>

144
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:21,953
<i>Ushioh scans the data from Nail Gun B.</i>

145
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:25,165
<i>She overwrites the old data,
then destroys the original.</i>

146
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:26,082
I see.

147
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,918
<i>Now I can use Nail Gun B again.</i>

148
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:32,714
<i>We'll put copying Nail Gun A on hold,
because Ushioh's storage is full.</i>

149
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:35,675
It's been five minutes
since Ryunosuke went in.

150
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:39,596
It's about time he tells us
to switch to Plan B.

151
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,143
Yes. Then two minutes later,
Shiori comes down from the balcony.

152
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,980
<i>The third shot misses and she flees…</i>

153
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:52,400
<i>but I capture her by
the green tea ice cream banner.</i>

154
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:54,277
Finally, I'll erase her.

155
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:55,362
Yes.

156
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:57,948
First, we wait to hear from Ryunosuke.

157
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,256
What the…

158
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:19,177
Run… away.

159
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:20,637
-Ms. Nagumo…
-Wait.

160
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,558
This is no longer like
the previous July 22…

161
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:33,275
I see you are all together.

162
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:36,528
{\an8}Hi-Hizuru!

163
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:42,033
{\an8}It can't be. Why? Why are you here?

164
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:46,663
You don't play fair, Shinpei.

165
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,123
What?

166
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:50,333
Didn't I tell you that time?

167
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,879
I told you, "I found you."

168
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,843
That is a mark.
I can find you in any world you go to.

169
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,472
Get it? I've been following you.

170
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:08,435
<i>Didn't our eyes meet
at the end of that summer festival?</i>

171
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,732
I can loop too.

172
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:20,280
I knew you'd come here because
I read Ryunosuke's memory last time.

173
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:23,158
It… can't be…

174
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:26,369
We don't need two observers.

175
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:27,787
It's either Mother…

176
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,998
or you.

177
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:37,130
The one who survives
will decide which world is real!

178
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:41,134
Come on! I'll kill you!

179
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:43,094
Three shots… What?

180
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:50,226
The three shots didn't stop him?

181
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:53,063
No!

182
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:01,947
<i>If I scan everything, I'll disappear.
But I'll take that one arm!</i>

183
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:07,869
<i>Whatever.</i>

184
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:12,207
<i>This is just a greeting, Shinpei Ajiro.</i>

185
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:15,543
<i>Loop as many times as you like.</i>

186
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:19,214
<i>I'll find you every time…</i>

187
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:23,718
<i>and seal that power in the end.</i>

188
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:29,849
<i>I was careless. I should have known
that the enemy may have the same powers.</i>

189
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:35,480
<i>Heine came from the summer festival.
Those two died because I was careless.</i>

190
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:37,065
<i>Ushioh! Where is she?</i>

191
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:38,775
Right here!

192
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:43,238
Sorry. Did your neck hurt?
I tried to make it as quick as possible.

193
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:47,951
Thank goodness, Ushioh.
I'm fine. You did great.

194
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,080
What about you? Are you okay?

195
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:56,167
I thought I could figure out
who Four-Arm was…

196
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:57,419
but it was empty.

197
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:02,424
It has no data in it.
How is it even moving?

198
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:04,342
I see…

199
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:08,847
<i>But it smells similar to Heine.</i>

200
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:12,475
Can we win against an enemy who can loop?

201
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:16,479
Heine is most likely
just using your power to loop.

202
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:21,192
So she'll loop to the same place as us.
Our conditions are even.

203
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:23,903
We can win, I know we can!

204
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,239
Eek…

205
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:27,866
Thanks.

206
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:38,126
BISTRO KOFUNE

207
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,045
What the…

208
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:42,922
This is our house.

209
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:47,385
Even if the start point changed,
when were we here?

210
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:54,059
This is odd. It shouldn't be raining.
July 22 was sunny.

211
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:58,480
Hey, hold on. Wait up, Sis.

212
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:06,112
That is…

213
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:12,035
No way. Ms. Nagumo?

214
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:16,206
No point thinking.
Let's follow them, Shinpei!

215
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:17,540
Right.

216
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,256
Oh… The setting changed?

217
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,593
Huh? It looks busy today.

218
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,972
Welcome, Hizuru and Ryunosuke.

219
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:38,478
Those two are Hizuru
and her twin Ryunosuke.

220
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:39,854
What is the meaning of this?

221
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,983
<i>When I died the first time,
something similar happened.</i>

222
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,985
Welcome. For two?

223
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:50,406
Ah. Why are you wearing an apron, Akemi?

224
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,452
{\an8}It's Bistro Kofune's 10th anniversary…

225
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,122
so everyone came by to eat here today.

226
00:16:57,205 --> 00:17:00,083
Is that right? Congrats!

227
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,710
Thanks. So I'm helping too.

228
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,587
Mother?

229
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,965
It's really Akemi. Wow!

230
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:09,843
So this is the past.

231
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,303
It's 14 years ago.

232
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:17,851
When I died the first time,
I was with Mio and the same happened.

233
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:23,314
I was at the beach where you died.
It was the past, and I saw everything.

234
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:27,777
That must've been Mio's memory.
Then is this Ms. Nagumo's memory?

235
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,029
Dessert is on us today!

236
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:31,656
Awesome!

237
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:34,450
I don't like crowds, so I'm going home.

238
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,286
Hey, wait a sec!

239
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,204
Asako. You were here?

240
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:42,917
It's a special day for Kofune.
We have to celebrate together.

241
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:46,337
I don't feel the need to
make a fuss to celebrate.

242
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:51,301
You don't need to go home, either!
Don't you have a heart?

243
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:54,387
I am human, so I have a heart.
But I want to leave.

244
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,266
<i>Ms. Nagumo really hasn't changed.</i>

245
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:06,566
Happy 10th anniversary, Bistro Kofune!

246
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,026
You should leave.

247
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:12,906
Oh, Hizuru. You look so happy to see me.
I'm flattered.

248
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,534
Ah, Toru and Masahito. Thanks.

249
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,620
Those ten years went quick.

250
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:24,751
Alain, your food is always great.
Please don't change.

251
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,086
Hey, did you look in the mirror?

252
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,422
You haven't shaved!
Your hair is messy too.

253
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,674
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

254
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,137
Your dad came too.
This must've been quite a day.

255
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:40,099
<i>Yeah, it's amazing. They're moving.</i>

256
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:44,062
<i>Their voices. Gestures.
That's how they were.</i>

257
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:47,523
What jobs did your parents do?

258
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:51,361
They were nautical archeologists.
They dive underwater.

259
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:55,156
Masahito, so you're finally a priest.

260
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,701
Yes. I have a lot to learn,
but I am doing my best.

261
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:01,120
What's new, Toru?

262
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:04,999
I'm thinking about diving
to that point I mentioned before.

263
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,713
Hitogashima Island has so much
unique history. I'm glad I moved here.

264
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:12,632
Food is great here too.

265
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,098
Hey, Ryunosuke.
Why is Hizuru in a bad mood?

266
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:23,184
Well, it's actually my fault.

267
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,479
I never should have told you.

268
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:27,522
Huh? What is it?

269
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:32,735
She says she made a friend.

270
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,070
What?

271
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:37,824
Unbelievable, right?
So I told her she's dreaming.

272
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:41,286
I told her it was an imaginary friend,
and she got mad.

273
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:43,204
That's just cruel, Ryunosuke.

274
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:45,290
-Actually, I can't believe it either.
-Hey.

275
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:48,584
I'm joking. Sorry Hizuru, I believe you.

276
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:51,754
You're joking?
I don't need a joker to believe me.

277
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:54,799
Asako didn't mean it like that.

278
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:56,134
It's fine, Ryunosuke.

279
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,386
Tell me about your friend.

280
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:03,891
We have less than 20 kids at school.
Where did you meet someone new?

281
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:05,476
Mt. Takanosu.

282
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:10,481
The setting changed again.

283
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:12,483
HISHIGATA CLINIC

284
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,068
Shinpei. This place…

285
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:17,155
Yes. The old Hishigata Clinic.

286
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,741
Was she really here?

287
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:22,076
Is she from the island?

288
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,119
I think so.

289
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,203
"You think so"?

290
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:28,166
She's probably not from our time.

291
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,587
You'll get it once you see her.
She usually appears around now.

292
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,049
There.

293
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:39,010
The light on the second floor
will turn on.

294
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:41,054
It's gotta be a ghost.

295
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:46,142
This is too creepy.
I hear there are ghosts here.

296
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:55,943
I don't see anyone.

297
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:59,364
Maybe she won't come today.

298
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:03,117
Hizuru, we should head back.
Our parents will be worried.

299
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:06,037
It'll be dangerous to go back
once it gets dark.

300
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,625
I promised to meet her today.
I keep promises.

301
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,794
Hizuru!

302
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:19,008
I'll take you home, Asako.
Sis gets stubborn like that.

303
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:47,078
<i>It can't be.</i>

304
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,038
Good evening…

305
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:51,457
Heine.

306
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,051
