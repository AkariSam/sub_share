1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,321
It's really coming down now.
The forecast was off, eh?

2
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:12,618
Forecast, prediction, warning,
expectation, plan, prophecy.

3
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:16,539
Things that tell of the future
have never been reliable.

4
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:18,874
Are you sure it's under here?

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,794
Yes. I have a bad feeling.

6
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:25,005
Let's hope my feeling is off too.

7
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,717
Run!

8
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:30,136
Don't stop!

9
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:36,392
Damn.

10
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:52,449
They're only going after Ushioh.

11
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,953
They haven't attacked me at all.

12
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,292
Ushioh!

13
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:04,545
Does your arm hurt?

14
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:09,383
<i>Oh no, we can't go any further.</i>

15
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,345
Get out of here! Go!

16
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:14,305
Sou!

17
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:18,851
Awesome!
Is this why you brought the insecticide?

18
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:20,978
Yeah! Just like I thought.

19
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:27,401
They're afraid of fire.
You okay, Ushioh? We can still go back.

20
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:28,986
I'm fine!

21
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:33,574
Let's keep going.
I hate leaving things halfway!

22
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:35,034
Figured you'd say that.

23
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:39,622
Shinpei! I'll open a path.
Take care of Ushioh.

24
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,957
You got it!

25
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:53,719
Ryunosuke!
Tell me when you're gonna shoot!

26
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:55,137
You blasted my ears.

27
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:58,724
Sorry, but you'd be dead
if I waited at all.

28
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:05,481
Can't believe these shadows are lurking
underneath the island.

29
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:10,027
There are more of them.
Their nest is close.

30
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:47,666
<i>The number you have called
is out of the range of…</i>

31
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:52,629
{\an8}<i>Where is Shinpei? He went out to see Sou.</i>

32
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,924
<i>I can't reach Sou or Tokiko either.</i>

33
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:00,637
Shinpei. Come home soon.

34
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:08,437
<i>Shadow sickness already took
Sis and Shiori. Not Shinpei too!</i>

35
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:14,651
What?

36
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,371
Isn't this Shiori's hair tie?

37
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:27,790
Over here.

38
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:30,459
Shinpei is here…

39
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,212
What? Wait!

40
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,926
Watch out… M-Mio?

41
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:41,053
Oh, Tetsu. Sorry.

42
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:45,349
Don't jump out like that.
What's going on? You look pale.

43
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:49,395
It's Shiori! Didn't you see her?

44
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:53,690
What? Was she found? Where is she?

45
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:56,735
She went running the way you came from.

46
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,823
No way, I only saw you running.

47
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:01,782
That's…

48
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,918
Shiori!

49
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,211
What?

50
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:16,547
She…

51
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,007
She disappeared.

52
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,552
Hey wait…

53
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,639
The manhole lid is loose.

54
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:29,685
Shinpei is here…

55
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:33,439
<i>What does that mean?
Is Shinpei down there?</i>

56
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:41,530
What? No, there's no way!
We must be mistaken!

57
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:45,451
There's no way a little girl
would go inside this thing!

58
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,244
Normally, I'd agree.

59
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:50,622
<i>But what if it was Shiori's shadow?</i>

60
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,082
-Tetsu…
-Hell, no.

61
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,501
I didn't even say anything!

62
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:59,673
You want me to check inside, right?
No way! I'm a busy man!

63
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,009
I'm on my way to the city for drinks!

64
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:06,638
If I show up smelling like the sewers,
Erika will hate me for sure!

65
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:08,974
So drinks are worth more
than a human life to you?

66
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:12,436
Jeez, no, but this one?

67
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,646
-You'd be a hero.
-What?

68
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,860
A hero who finds a missing girl
would be all over the news.

69
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:24,698
You'd be famous.
Erika would totally fall for you.

70
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:30,287
But I won't force you.
I'm going with or without you.

71
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,747
Follow me.

72
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,376
It's not like I wanna be a hero
and get girls, don't get me wrong!

73
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,089
I'm an ally of justice
who just wants to find Shiori!

74
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,550
Well… Thanks.

75
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:46,428
Being superficial is totally better
than doing nothing.

76
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:49,014
Isn't that a little harsh, Mio?

77
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,816
Did we escape them?

78
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:03,362
Yeah… but what is this place?

79
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:05,906
It's starting to look even stranger.

80
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:09,409
Yeah, look. This is impossible.

81
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:10,327
What?

82
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:16,083
These are corals.
How can sea animals live on land?

83
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,459
They're shadows.

84
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:18,377
What?

85
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,215
The corals, sea anemones,
and barnacles are all shadows.

86
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:26,176
Who would do anything like this?

87
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:30,305
I don't know,
but someone printed the sea here.

88
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:38,605
It's seawater.
This must be connected to the sea.

89
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:41,567
It'd be great if we can find
another way to get out.

90
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:45,028
This is getting too dangerous, Shinpei.

91
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:50,367
I've used up all the gas too.
It's over if we get attacked again.

92
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:54,788
H-Hey, Ushioh?

93
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:58,625
I'm okay. Just hungry.

94
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,963
How is that possible?
We just ate an hour ago!

95
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:06,675
That's not your usual hunger.

96
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:10,137
Your right arm hasn't healed, has it?

97
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:15,017
<i>This is damaged data from my real body.</i>

98
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,561
To heal it, I need food.

99
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,397
Then Shinpei can give you
another rice ball…

100
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,233
No. I don't mean normal food.

101
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:27,696
The only way to repair this data
is to rescan the original.

102
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,410
But Ushio was cremated.
I can't repair this wound.

103
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:36,622
A-Are you serious?

104
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:42,586
All this time, it's been hurting since
the shadow Mio stabbed you yesterday?

105
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,547
I wasn't sure until just now.

106
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:48,634
Why did you keep something
so important from us?

107
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:54,222
Sorry. I'll erase my right arm for now.
That will take away the pain.

108
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:58,185
<i>No way to heal it? That can't be.</i>

109
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:03,774
<i>She is getting weaker, dammit.
I can't let her die again.</i>

110
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,072
<i>What if I loop, or turn back the time?
How would that heal it?</i>

111
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:11,448
Don't move.

112
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,034
Turn around slowly.

113
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:19,831
If you two make any sudden moves,
it will cost you Ushioh's life.

114
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:22,918
W-What are you doing here?

115
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:25,962
Tokiko!

116
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,424
It's a dead end.

117
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:34,346
Shadows came from here.
It's a path only they can go through.

118
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,390
We know one thing now.

119
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:41,186
Shadows used these sewers and tunnels
to move around the island.

120
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:47,818
Yeah. The army dug
a lot of these in this area.

121
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:50,862
No one even knows
the entire layout anymore.

122
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,408
There could be many of these passages.

123
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:59,746
What should we do?
We don't have tools to cut steel bars.

124
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:02,999
Should we go back up
and find another way in?

125
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,920
Based on the map,
we're near the center of the island.

126
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:13,552
No. There probably isn't an entrance
that humans can use.

127
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:18,390
Take a look ahead. This isn't a sewer.

128
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:22,811
It's a natural cave that was always here.

129
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:26,481
Hiruko's grotto really existed.

130
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:27,524
What?

131
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:30,444
My gramps told me about it
when I was a kid.

132
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:34,698
There's a massive underground cave
in Hitogashima Island.

133
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,658
That's Hiruko's grotto.

134
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:43,749
Until the mid-Meiji era,
an entrance appeared during the low tide…

135
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:49,588
but the army closed it up
during the First Sino-Japanese War.

136
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:54,342
Hiruko's grotto is an island legend
that I thought was a myth.

137
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:58,638
It's where our guardian god Hiruko lived…

138
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:02,559
after drifting to Hitogashima Island.

139
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:08,690
That's Hiruko's Lore.
Sis would know more. Should we switch?

140
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:11,026
Not right now.

141
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,865
We can ask the Karikiri boy,
but I wish his old man was alive.

142
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:22,829
The man might have known something.
Anyways, let's go back and get tools…

143
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:24,539
Quiet.

144
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:29,836
Hey, let's just go back.
She won't be in here.

145
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,049
It was Shiori up there. You saw her too!

146
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:40,263
Man, I smell like the sewers now.
I gotta take a bath before I go out.

147
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:45,477
I'll tell Erika how manly you are, okay?

148
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,729
Oh, you would?

149
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:50,023
Oh. Shiori!

150
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:55,237
Hold on a sec.
How did she get to the other side?

151
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:05,121
Yuck.

152
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:07,833
No way. Wait!

153
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,919
Are we dreaming?

154
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:18,009
What? You're going?
I have expensive shoes on!

155
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,719
Hey, that was…

156
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:22,973
Mio Kofune and the police officer
Tetsu Totsumura.

157
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:26,935
Sis's bad feeling may have been right.

158
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:32,023
I wouldn't follow them. It's a trap.

159
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:36,361
At least we know Mio is human.
She has immunity.

160
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:41,867
Who knows? I guess we'll find out.

161
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:44,995
Tokiko.

162
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,957
I'm surprised you survived this far
intruding on forbidden soil, Brother.

163
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,544
Answer me! What is this about, Tokiko?

164
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,840
<i>She's too far.
She's out of range for the nail gun.</i>

165
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:59,134
What are you doing here?

166
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:00,510
Dumb question.

167
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,470
W-What?

168
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:08,476
Recovering faulty goods.
Thank you for bringing Ushioh to me.

169
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:13,106
She is tough to find since she's broken.

170
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:18,028
<i>She is coming closer.
I can reach her in three more steps.</i>

171
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,363
We'll take care of her from here.

172
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:23,533
<i>I won't let you touch Ushioh!</i>

173
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,749
<i>Please! Stop!</i>

174
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:37,464
What the…

175
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:39,424
No, Shinpei.

176
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,384
Tokiko…

177
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:45,347
Too bad, Shinpei.

178
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,604
I'm human.
You can kill shadows, but not humans.

179
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:56,274
Are you really Tokiko?

180
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:02,572
Shall we chat for a bit?

181
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:08,536
My apologies, Neguro.

182
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,247
How may I help, Doctor?

183
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,334
Add this to today's fodder.

184
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:19,464
It's almost nine. Hurry and carry it over.

185
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,425
Yes, Doctor. I understand.

186
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:37,941
We surrender.

187
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:39,943
No! Shinpei!

188
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,027
Sou!

189
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:46,741
Shinpei's right.
It sucks, but we can't win.

190
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:50,370
Don't do anything stupid, Brother.

191
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:52,497
Grab her.

192
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:59,379
Ushioh! Dammit! Stop it, Tokiko!

193
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:01,006
Sou. Calm down.

194
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:01,965
What?

195
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,551
She would have already killed her
if she wanted to.

196
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:09,139
She just wants to take Ushioh.
Am I right, Tokiko?

197
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:13,143
<i>I haven't figured anything out yet.</i>

198
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:19,691
<i>If I can take the silence as a "Yes,"
then it's still early.</i>

199
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:25,155
<i>Sorry, Ushioh, hang in there.
It's just going to be a bit longer.</i>

200
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:28,491
Where are you taking her? To your father?

201
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:33,455
I get it, Tokiko.
Is Dad making you do all this?

202
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:36,124
You're so clueless, Brother.

203
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:41,212
I guess it's inevitable.
Dad didn't choose you.

204
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:42,797
W-What?

205
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:47,510
If you've seen this much,
there's no point in hiding it anymore.

206
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:50,597
This could be a good opportunity
to show you everything.

207
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:59,230
Please put down your weapons.
I'll guide you if you comply.

208
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:05,070
I don't want to take drastic measures.
Please come at your own will.

209
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:08,364
Hiruko is waiting.

210
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,497
You'll miss. A little to the right.
Five degrees to the right.

211
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,414
Shut up!

212
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:18,917
Don't worry about me.

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,876
Fine.

214
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,711
Focus on your own target.

215
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:25,924
We lost track of Mio. Is she okay?

216
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:32,263
It's not the time to worry about others.
Look around. What is this place?

217
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:35,016
It's like the bottom of the sea.

218
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:39,229
That is a Doflein sea anemone.

219
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:41,898
Dof… what?

220
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:46,277
It lives in the deep sea.
I saw it on TV before.

221
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:51,199
They cannot live on land.
These must be all shadows.

222
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:52,742
-Behind us!
-What?

223
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,453
I don't like this.

224
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:02,961
You killed that thing twice!
Why is it still here?

225
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,421
Is it immortal?

226
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:08,383
Oh? You're not surprised?

227
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:12,720
It would make sense
if you didn't really die.

228
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:18,309
<i>You faked being killed,
and dove underground. Right?</i>

229
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:21,354
<i>Sis was suspicious of the sewers.</i>

230
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:26,109
I see. As expected from Hizuru.
Why did you return to get in my way?

231
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,820
I told you I'd kill you
if I saw you again.

232
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:33,867
I guess you wouldn't know,
Ryunosuke Minakata.

233
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:35,827
-Hey, you.
-No!

234
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,328
How do you know that name?

235
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:43,835
<i>I figured out you hid inside Hizuru
when we talked in the kid's room.</i>

236
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,796
It can't be. Are you Heine?

237
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,552
It's been 14 years
since we saw each other.

238
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:57,765
However, I'm not interested in you.
You're only a personality and a memory.

239
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,977
Where is your body?

240
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:06,482
Where's the body that stole
Mother's right eye?

241
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:11,613
Heine, you're playing make-believe
all over again?

242
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:14,824
This time you're using
Shiori Kobayakawa's memory.

243
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:19,871
It got blocked.

244
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,041
That shot should have hit.

245
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:28,713
I read his memory. Neither Hizuru
nor Ryunosuke knows where the body is.

246
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,465
I can't read the old man.

247
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,008
Can I kill him?

248
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:32,926
Sure.

249
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:36,137
Let's run, Ryunosuke. We can't beat that.

250
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:37,972
You've got to be kidding.

251
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:41,684
Don't you get it?
We're the ones being hunted!

252
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:47,523
They're not shadows of humans,
but of something much more terrible.

253
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:52,111
Watch it. He's slightly off.

254
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:55,448
He's about two seconds ahead.

255
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,618
Yes. I know.

256
00:18:58,701 --> 00:18:59,953
Ryunosuke!

257
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,295
There. One down.

258
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:17,262
Nezu!

259
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,807
Damn you!

260
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:22,016
Oh?

261
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:25,186
Around there?

262
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,861
So close.

263
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:38,533
It's hard to hit two seconds ahead.

264
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:42,245
You're not going after him?

265
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:47,834
No need. The blood is dark.
I hit the liver.

266
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:51,587
It's a fatal blow. He'll die soon anyway.

267
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,965
Where are Ushioh and Shinpei?

268
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:59,304
They're close, but don't worry.
I sent two stray shadows with Tokiko.

269
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:05,393
More importantly, I'm really hungry.
I can't wait 'til nine o'clock.

270
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:19,407
<i>Dammit, I have no strength.
Shinpei lost his weapon and surrendered.</i>

271
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:24,495
<i>He must've decided not to loop
before finding out the truth.</i>

272
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:29,542
<i>He's going to go as far as he can.
Right, Shinpei?</i>

273
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:36,966
That wasn't me!

274
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,803
It's Hiruko. She's hungry.

275
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,602
I have accepted what I do.

276
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:55,193
I won't ask for forgiveness.
I just want you all to understand it.

277
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:59,906
Dad is opposed to telling
you though, Brother.

278
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,579
I won't warn you not to tell anyone,
because you can't.

279
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:12,001
But please don't tell Mio, Shinpei.

280
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:17,256
I don't want Mio to find out
what you see and learn here.

281
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:21,803
I won't get Mio involved with this.

282
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:26,182
Good. You're kind.

283
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:35,191
<i>A long shadow stretches to the ceiling.</i>

284
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:38,569
<i>At the foot of that shadow…</i>

285
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:49,997
Nine o'clock sharp.

286
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:53,751
Time to eat.

287
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
