00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,401
{\an8}Ushio!

2
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:23,754
Huh?

3
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,424
Miss... Nagumo?

4
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:28,342
What?

5
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:31,137
You're alive!

6
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:33,848
What is it?

7
00:00:34,849 --> 00:00:39,520
{\an8}I don't believe
we've met before, young man.

8
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,356
{\an8}<i>We will soon arrive in Hitogashima.</i>

9
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,861
{\an8}But Hizuru, you're Ryunosuke Nagumo...

10
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:48,362
aren't you?

11
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:51,031
PORT KADA - HITOGASHIMA

12
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:54,660
{\an8}How do you know I am?

13
00:00:56,162 --> 00:01:00,833
<i>Hitogashima lies in the Kitan Strait
in Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture.</i>

14
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,587
<i>You can see Awajishima behind it.</i>

15
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:08,299
<i>Its area is about 5.3 square kilometers.</i>

16
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:14,013
<i>With a population of around 700, it is
known for Yomogimochi and Salted Squid.</i>

17
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:18,184
<i>It is a small island
supported by tourism and fishery.</i>

18
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:25,274
<i>I've come home
for the first time in two years...</i>

19
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:28,277
<i>Huh?</i>

20
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,779
{\an8}JULY 22

21
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:35,576
<i>I've seen this before, but...</i>

22
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,495
<i>of course, it is my hometown.</i>

23
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,582
<i>But more recently...</i>

24
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:53,135
<i>How do I know that
she is Ryunosuke Nagumo?</i>

25
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,846
Hey!

26
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,640
Welcome home, Shinpei!

27
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:00,392
Hope you had a nice trip!

28
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:01,352
Mio.

29
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:05,314
Mio, watch out!

30
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,612
What are you doing, Shinpei?

31
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:15,241
Good question. What am I doing?

32
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:16,992
Shinpei!

33
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,745
Here, I'll give you a hug!

34
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,790
You finally came back.

35
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,458
It's been a long two years.

36
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:28,420
-Your hair got so long. You're taller too?
-<i>Thank goodness. Everyone is safe.</i>

37
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:36,178
-So you're a real Tokyo boy now, Shinpei?
-<i>Why am I so happy now?</i>

38
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:38,555
Hey, Sou.

39
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,517
I'm wondering... Why I came back.

40
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:45,271
What? You hurt my feelings!
Is it just us who wanted to see you?

41
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,399
Shinpei. Are you being serious?

42
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:53,529
For some reason, I just feel like
I was really worried about you guys.

43
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:57,700
His hair is so long.
He looks like a different person.

44
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:59,493
It makes him look older.

45
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:01,787
Uh, you think so?

46
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:07,918
Ushio contacted you, right?
You told me so on the phone yesterday.

47
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:12,131
She would beat you up good
if you didn't come back this year.

48
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:14,842
BE CAREFUL

49
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:19,638
Sis said she'd punch you when she saw you.

50
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:21,932
Ushio would actually do that.

51
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,351
Come on. Shinpei did come back.

52
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,273
There you are!

53
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,733
Ushio!

54
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,943
-She hit him!
-She hit him!

55
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,197
-No, she didn't.
-No, she didn't.

56
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:41,744
So you're back, Shinpei.

57
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:45,956
You're the one who left me the voice mail.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,833
Shut it!

59
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,461
Why are you acting like
you're doing us a favor?

60
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:53,464
Even if you ignore us,
you think we'll still be here.

61
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:54,840
Whoa, scary!

62
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:56,508
She's so mad.

63
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,888
She's just frustrated
because the beach isn't clean.

64
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:04,433
We just cleaned it up,
but someone left trash there.

65
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:05,934
-Is that Shinpei?
-Nope, a stranger.

66
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:08,562
Mio, go back to the restaurant.

67
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:09,980
Okay!

68
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:15,402
BISTRO KOFUNE

69
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:20,908
Oh, why are you here?
Don't you have to go home first?

70
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:21,992
Well...

71
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:26,246
No. No one is home today.

72
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,127
Oh, Shinpei! Welcome back.

73
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,712
I'm back.

74
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:38,425
Oh! You look a bit more manly now.

75
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:39,676
Come on.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,429
Hey! Are you back for the festival?

77
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,264
Yes. Well...

78
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:47,768
Ushio, right? She said she called you.

79
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,355
Oh! Did you make up with Ushio?

80
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,357
Well, not quite...

81
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,401
They met at the port earlier.

82
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:56,652
Well?

83
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:58,695
Oh, no!

84
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,413
You two have been in a cold war
ever since you went to Tokyo, huh?

85
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:08,831
Yeah.

86
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,251
{\an8}TOKYO JULY 21

87
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,335
VOICE MESSAGE - USHIO
NEW RECORDING

88
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,922
<i>I'm hoping this is Ajiro's number.</i>

89
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,215
<i>Well...</i>

90
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:21,927
<i>It's not that I want to
see you or anything,</i>

91
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,763
<i>but you should at least come back
during summer break.</i>

92
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:30,144
<i>If you still ignore this message,
I'll come to Tokyo myself,</i>

93
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,854
<i>and drag you back by the neck.</i>

94
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,148
<i>Later, Ajiro.</i>

95
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:41,864
<i>Who knows why she called me Ajiro,
but when I thought about why she called,</i>

96
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:45,409
<i>I remembered the strange dream
that I had the night before.</i>

97
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,537
<i>I don't remember what it was about,</i>

98
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:54,543
<i>but I was filled with fear that
this island would disappear.</i>

99
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:02,509
<i>I came back to see that
everyone was safe with my own eyes.</i>

100
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,639
Whoa, so cold!

101
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,391
Of course. It's ice cream.

102
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:11,101
-Which one should I get?
-I wanna see.

103
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:14,104
-Just pick! They're gonna melt! Hurry!
-I'll take this.

104
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:17,399
-Let me see!
-I'll take the green tea ice cream!

105
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:18,317
-Close it!
-Me too!

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,986
-I want one!
-Oh, they have roasted green tea flavor!

107
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,070
Hi.

108
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,907
-Welcome. Oh, Shinpei!
-Oh, Shinpei!

109
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:28,494
Long time no see. You all got so big.

110
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:30,454
Are you really Shinpei?

111
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:31,371
What?

112
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:33,790
Wow! You really came back!

113
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:36,251
Ushio was right!

114
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,711
Ushio?

115
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:39,213
GREEN TEA ICE CREAM

116
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:41,256
She's been talking about it all morning.

117
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,177
She said you were coming back
because she called you.

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,595
Like, five times!

119
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,347
Five times?

120
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:53,227
Don't you get it?
After all, she wants to see Shinpei.

121
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:56,021
That's so cool that
you actually came back!

122
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,898
So cool, Shinpei!

123
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:00,234
It's not that I'm cool.

124
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:04,613
Didn't she call me Ajiro?

125
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:06,490
Ajiro? That's so weird!

126
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:09,618
-She was like, "Shinpei..."
-She likes you too much!

127
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:10,953
Like a married couple!

128
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:14,540
Shiori! One more!

129
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:15,457
Go grab it yourself.

130
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,251
-Gimme one too!
-You don't want one?

131
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,836
They're melted!

132
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,007
61ST HITO SUMMER FESTIVAL

133
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:25,634
Fireworks?

134
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:30,639
The festival is on the same day
as Heine's birthday!

135
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,600
Plus Ushio's birthday is the day after.

136
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:37,062
Right! Lots of celebrations!

137
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:38,939
-<i>I feel so...</i>
-I wanna eat cake.

138
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:41,024
-<i>relieved.</i>
-Dummy! It's not your birthday!

139
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:41,942
{\an8}GRADE 3-1 SHIORI KOBAYAKAWA

140
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:42,859
I'm off.

141
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,194
Already?

142
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:47,197
It has been a while,
so I want to look around.

143
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,032
What? You're like a tourist.

144
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:52,494
-Tourist!
-Tourist!

145
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:04,256
Hito Shrine.

146
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:13,390
HITO SHRINE

147
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:24,943
Shinpei?

148
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:29,448
Shinpei Ajiro.

149
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,908
Mr. Karikiri!

150
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,077
It's Shinpei!

151
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,204
Long time no see, Iwao.

152
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,706
How many years has it been?

153
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,624
Two years.

154
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,337
So long. This is my son.
Do you remember him?

155
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:45,589
We met at the port earlier.

156
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:47,090
Yamato.

157
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,216
That's right!

158
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,385
Impressive, Shinpei.

159
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:55,932
He came back from the mainland last year,
so I'll let him do the ceremony this year.

160
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,559
He's the next generation.

161
00:08:57,643 --> 00:08:59,019
Exactly.

162
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:01,605
It's that time of year again.

163
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:08,362
Yes, it's great to celebrate
another year with no problems.

164
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:15,327
By the way, Ushio lost her necklace
while cleaning the beach.

165
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,912
Oh my.

166
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:22,542
It seemed important, and she's been
searching for two days without any luck.

167
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,544
Poor thing.

168
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:34,346
Shinpei?

169
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:35,722
Excuse me.

170
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:37,224
Of course.

171
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:46,358
<i>I can hear the ocean
no matter where I am on the island.</i>

172
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:52,155
<i>I felt like that sound
would lead me to her.</i>

173
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:52,883
Shin... Ajiro!
We keep running into each other today.

174
00:10:56,887 --> 00:11:00,307
You called me "Shinpei"
when you saw me at the port earlier.

175
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,019
What? Seriously? No way.

176
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:07,022
Are you sure you heard me right? Dummy.

177
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,316
I'm sorry...

178
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:12,694
that I decided to go to Tokyo
without telling you.

179
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:15,113
I feel really bad about that.

180
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:19,826
I'm glad.

181
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:23,872
I'm glad you're safe.

182
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,166
Oh... Ushio.

183
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:29,961
You know what? I had a weird dream.

184
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:36,635
Two nights ago...
I dreamed that I'd never see you again.

185
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:44,017
That was my punishment
for not seeing you off,

186
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,898
but I didn't want for us to
end up separated like this.

187
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,737
Then I couldn't stop myself
from calling you. Sorry.

188
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:58,448
No, I... actually...

189
00:11:58,532 --> 00:11:59,533
Gotcha!

190
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,163
You can't move now.

191
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,628
<i>I feel like I had the same dream.</i>

192
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,258
Now we're even!

193
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,971
Oh! You got me!

194
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:28,603
What?

195
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:37,696
What is it?

196
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:42,450
Uh, is this your...

197
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:48,582
Wow! There it is!

198
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,920
I'm so happy.

199
00:12:56,631 --> 00:13:01,261
I lost it at the beach cleanup
two days ago. I looked everywhere.

200
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:06,057
I thought I couldn't see you if I lost it.

201
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:09,686
I had that strange dream,
so I got so worried.

202
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:16,776
But it's okay. I was sad and lonely,
but I'm happy now!

203
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:37,172
Shinpei. Your hair is so long.

204
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:39,549
Yeah.

205
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,885
It looks weird.

TO SHINPEI AJIRO
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO

212
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,451
Thank you.

213
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:07,786
<i>FESTIVAL PARALLAX</i>
BY RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO

214
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:09,746
Wow.

215
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:17,921
You had the same dream
on the same day separately,

216
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:22,425
and you found out who I was in that dream.

217
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,887
I think so.

218
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:31,351
{\an8}Neither Ushio nor I can't remember
the details of the dream though.

219
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:35,188
Foresight? No, memory.

220
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:39,734
Is it some sort of local memory
shared by the people on this island?

221
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:47,325
Feeling of repeating. Parallel worlds.
Rather, memories of parallel worlds.

222
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:51,246
There was a book I remembered
after that dream.

223
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:55,041
I just saw it online,
and haven't read it yet.

224
00:14:56,835 --> 00:15:02,507
<i>Strange Life of Ivan Osokin</i> by Ouspensky?

225
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,467
Yes! That's it!

226
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:06,386
Hello.

227
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,556
Is Heine's birthday party over?

228
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:12,600
Yes! I'm so full.

229
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:13,727
Hello.

230
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,437
Hey. Ryunosuke.

231
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,609
Do Hizuru and Shinpei know each another?

232
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:25,321
Seems like they met on the ferry.

233
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:27,615
Oh. Thanks.

234
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,576
Ah! Hizuru!

235
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:33,788
Thanks for the birthday gift!

236
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:34,873
Sure.

237
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,334
Did everyone come to your party, Heine?

238
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:41,504
Yeah! Tomorrow is Ushio's birthday, too.

239
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,298
Yes, it is.

240
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:46,509
Heine, don't interrupt them.

241
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:48,970
Sorry, Shinpei.

242
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,138
It's okay.

243
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,226
Heine just thanked me for the gift.
She wasn't interrupting.

244
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:56,186
Yeah?

245
00:15:56,352 --> 00:16:01,691
Nah, I did.
You shouldn't interrupt them either, Papa.

246
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,776
Oops...

247
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:07,405
Do you want coffee, Ryunosuke?

248
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:10,617
Does something interest you
about my niece?

249
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,912
No. Actually, yes.

250
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:17,123
I'm just glad.

251
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:24,005
It's odd, isn't it?
I wonder why I feel that way?

252
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:28,551
"Why did you pass by and leave us here?"

253
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:34,057
"In this vast valley of tears,
calm in its emptiness."

254
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,435
Uh, that's...

255
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,686
Recognize those lines?

256
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,647
No, sorry.

257
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,859
Sis. Don't pick on Shinpei too much.

258
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,824
He's a huge Ryunosuke Nagumo fan.
No wonder he found you.

259
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:55,078
I am a pseudonymous author.
I have never revealed my identity.

260
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:58,540
Don't interrupt me with
your silly comments, dummy.

261
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,749
Whoa...

262
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:04,212
I hope you haven't told anyone
on the island about me.

263
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,672
Of course not!

264
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:10,927
Isn't she a tough one? She's working
on a new book now, so she's even so.

265
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:12,095
Huh?

266
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:16,641
But despite how she seems,
she's happy to meet a fan.

267
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,059
What are you saying?

268
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:22,021
Uh... You're writing a new book?

269
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,190
I guess.

270
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,111
Wow, that's great.
The <i>Hijiri</i> series, or something else?

271
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,238
Why would I tell you?

272
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,156
KISHU SPECIALITY <i>HAYAZUSHI</i>

273
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:35,952
I'm in Wakayama for research
and rest, but this was unexpected.

274
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:41,916
Your story is interesting. Tell me more.

275
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,836
Oh... Sure!

276
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:49,799
Dad. Sis wants to go soon.

277
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:52,927
Okay! Everything is ready here.

278
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:57,932
Welcome.

279
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:01,352
What are you standing there for?

280
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,437
Sorry.

281
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,857
Ah! Hizuru and Shinpei. You were here.

282
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,568
Come, follow me!

283
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:09,986
-Okay!
-Okay!

284
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,821
Wait! Before that.

285
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:15,366
Okay. Get closer together.

286
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:17,952
-I'll take it.
-Say cheese.

287
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:26,002

00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:47,482
<i>It leaves behind the relief,
loneliness, and pain of time passed.</i>

292
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:55,365
So Shinpei. Did you make up with Ushio?

293
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:58,076
{\an8}Huh? Ah... Yeah.

294
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:01,704
{\an8}What? Cat got your tongue?

295
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:03,706
{\an8}We did.

296
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:06,876
{\an8}I see. Glad to hear it.

297
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:09,462
{\an8}I mean...

298
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,302
{\an8}There was nothing to do.
All the tension between us just vanished.

299
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,681
It was a little sad.

300
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:22,141
It was like that.

301
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:25,478
{\an8}I see. That's fine.

302
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:27,981
{\an8}No. It's not.

303
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:33,444
{\an8}I mean, you two are fine, but I'm not yet.

304
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:34,696
{\an8}No?

305
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,908
{\an8}Shinpei. Lend me your strength.

306
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,034
Strength?

307
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:43,955
During the fireworks show,
stay on the beach with everyone.

308
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:46,207
{\an8}I'll take Mio to the shrine grounds.

309
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:51,921
{\an8}Sou. You still like Mio...

310
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,590
{\an8}Is that a problem?

311
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,467
What are you talking about?

312
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:58,761
Well, I...

313
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:03,224
{\an8}You two are like peas in a pod.

314
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:20,533
Ms. Nagumo.

315
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:22,785
{\an8}The fireworks will start soon.

316
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:26,956
{\an8}Just wait.

317
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,460
{\an8}The ideas are flooding in. I can't stop.

318
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:33,588
Thanks to you, I broke out of my slump!

00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:44,599
<i>Where are you?</i>

322
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:45,683
By the food stands.

323
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:47,643
<i>I'm heading to the beach now.</i>

324
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,103
Oh? Where's everyone?

325
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,272
<i>Sou and Mio will watch
from the shrine grounds.</i>

326
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:55,902
Sou still wants to tell Mio
how he feels about her, huh?

327
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,737
<i>How do you know that?</i>

328
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,910
Sou told me. He wanted me
to be at the beach so I wouldn't see.

329
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:07,872
He told me the exact same thing.

330
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:11,292
<i>Sou never gives up.</i>

331
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:13,920
<i>Mio rejected him last year too,
during the festival.</i>

332
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:14,837
Seriously?

333
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:19,801
Jeez, I'm so hungry
after carrying the <i>omikoshi.</i>

334
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:21,636
<i>Buy me </i>takoyaki.

335
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:25,056
Sure. Come to the end of the levees.

336
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:37,860
What do you like about me, Sou?

337
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:47,286
Ushio.

338
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:51,249
Shinpei. You're so late.

339
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:52,542
Here.

340
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,711
Yay! Thank you! Oh, wait...

341
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:58,256
Is this all you got?

342
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:00,758
How many did you want?

343
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:04,178
What? But you promised me that time!

344
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:07,515
That time? Did I say something?

345
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:13,729
Yeah! Remember? When was it...
I almost have it.

346
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,026
Back then? When we were
in that narrow space at the old clinic?

347
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:23,322
-"I'll buy you as much as you want."
-"I'll buy you as much as you want."

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,631
