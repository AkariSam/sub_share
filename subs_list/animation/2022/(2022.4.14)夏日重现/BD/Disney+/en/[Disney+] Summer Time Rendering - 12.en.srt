1
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,276
<i>I finally found her.</i>

2
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:10,950
<i>What did she do at that summer festival?
No, what will she do?</i>

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,494
<i>If I can find that out, I can stop her!</i>

4
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:19,917
Hiruko appears in the form of Heine,
whom she copied first.

5
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:23,754
She enjoys being called by that name.

6
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:30,970
She is the god of Hitogashima Island.
Hiruko-no-Mikoto, mother of the shadows.

7
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:34,431
This kid… is a god?

8
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:38,936
Recently, due to poor nutrition,
her legs have weakened.

9
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:41,355
She needed another body.

10
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:50,114
How many times have we met like this?

11
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:53,868
Shinpei Ajiro.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,541
You were still alive.

13
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,960
You did it.

14
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:07,423
<i>You killed Ushio. You killed Mio.</i>

15
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,426
<i>You're the monster
who swallowed up the island.</i>

16
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:14,430
<i>You were the god of this island?</i>

17
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:19,059
<i>You were right there from the beginning…</i>

18
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:23,063
in front of me all along!

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,776
Shinpei, step back!

20
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,206
No, Heine!

21
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,292
{\an8}NIGHT OF BLOOD

22
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:12,339
{\an8}His loud voice echoes in my head
and irritates me.

23
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:15,718
I almost killed you by accident.

24
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:23,350
I like my meals in silence.
Don't speak to me again.

25
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:25,144
Tokiko.

26
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,276
Ms. Negoro?

27
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,193
What?

28
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:36,905
She's a nurse at our clinic.

29
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,618
<i>An average of four die each year
on Hitogashima Island…</i>

30
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:43,203
by illness or accident.

31
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:46,206
You figured it out.

32
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:51,795
We have always given
those dead people to her.

33
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,047
My father too.

34
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:58,218
My grandfather, great-grandfather,
and so on.

35
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:05,142
What's with the coffins?
Don't tell me you feed people to her!

36
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:11,857
I was waiting for this.
Quite a feast today.

37
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:15,194
Tomorrow shall be even bigger.

38
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,620
I said you weren't capable of killing.

39
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:31,293
But I am prepared to die by your hands.

40
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:36,090
Wait. Tokiko, it can't be…

41
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,865
Come closer and take a look, Ushioh.

42
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:07,663
This is your original
that I missed out on eating.

43
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:10,833
No! Ushio!

44
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,627
Is it Ushio?

45
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:19,007
But we cremated her yesterday.
We gathered her bones!

46
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:25,556
Father switched out her body.
Heine printed those bones from someone.

47
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:33,522
Why? Why go that far?
Why take care of her?

48
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:38,360
Tokiko, you knew everything?
Shiori being targeted?

49
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:40,571
Ushio being killed?

50
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:43,532
I didn't know about Ushio.

51
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:48,829
I had no idea she and her shadow
were working together to save Shiori.

52
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:53,125
She died because she got involved
in something that she shouldn't have.

53
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,669
What?

54
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,256
This was all for Heine.

55
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:04,094
Shut up! I can't forgive this!

56
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:05,929
Where is the old man?

57
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:09,641
You don't know anything!
Shut your mouth, idiot!

58
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:14,354
It's all because of you
that I got stuck with this!

59
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:25,908
I didn't have a choice. I didn't.

60
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,497
If Heine dies, so would Mother.

61
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,664
What?

62
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:39,296
<i>Mother is alive not because
her sickness is gone.</i>

63
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:45,010
<i>Father begged Heine to turn her
into a shadow to keep her alive.</i>

64
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,390
What? What do you mean?

65
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,896
I don't get this. Mother is… What?

66
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:58,482
Both you and Shinpei…

67
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,986
treat Ushioh like the real Ushio,
don't you?

68
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:06,907
Tokiko.

69
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:21,672
<i>No.</i>

70
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:27,344
<i>I can't let Ushio be eaten by her
and disappear!</i>

71
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:34,184
<i>Shadows freeze for a few seconds
during a scan. It's the same for Heine.</i>

72
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,814
Now, Ushioh! Print!

73
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:42,109
I was waiting for you to say that!

74
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:43,652
Take this!

75
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,032
Ushioh!

76
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:05,591
Are you hurt?

77
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:10,804
No fair! You stole my dinner!

78
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:13,765
Thanks, Ushioh. Are you okay?

79
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,896
<i>The right time's upon us. Now I…</i>

80
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:20,897
Why?

81
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,277
Why fight against shadows? Are you stupid?

82
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:30,490
You'll just die. You can't win.
There's no way.

83
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:35,454
The Tokiko I know won't do this willingly.

84
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,915
It's just using you…

85
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,085
taking advantage of your weakness.

86
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:48,008
It's playing with your emotions
to feed its hunger.

87
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:52,888
Can you just accept that?
Because I never would!

88
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:57,809
Don't be messing with
my sister's best friend.

89
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:03,482
A god, Hiruko, whatever you are.
Don't underestimate humans!

90
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,442
Ushioh.

91
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:06,526
Boring.

92
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:12,240
What?

93
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:16,953
No more need to copy humans?

94
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:20,332
I want to eat Ushio's memories.

95
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,584
Leave him for dead.

96
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:26,004
<i>The best option now…</i>

97
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:30,884
<i>is for Ushioh to break my neck
and for me to loop back.</i>

98
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:34,846
<i>That was actually my plan.</i>

99
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:39,393
<i>I need to avoid exposing Ushioh
to any more danger.</i>

100
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:46,858
<i>But…</i>

101
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:52,072
<i>I should stop Ushioh, but I can't.</i>

102
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:54,658
<i>I know why.</i>

103
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:56,743
<i>Both Ushioh and I…</i>

104
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:57,744
There it is!

105
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:00,789
<i>…share the same feeling!</i>

106
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:03,834
<i>Don't underestimate humans!</i>

107
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:19,808
<i>If I'm dying anyway, I'll fight and die.</i>

108
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:26,690
Shin…

109
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:31,361
Stop, Heine. That's enough.

110
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,415
You just tried to eat Shinpei, didn't you?

111
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:47,753
But they took my food!

112
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:49,379
It doesn't matter.

113
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:51,214
What… Boo!

114
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:55,469
But… Why?

115
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:59,222
Don't worry, Heine.

116
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:04,394
I'll get Ushio Kofune's body back.

117
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:10,525
You can't eat this one.
She's an important hostage.

118
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:11,485
-Mio!
-Mio!

119
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,657
Shut up. I know already.

120
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:24,956
Don't worry. Mio is alive.

121
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,252
However, if you make even one step,

122
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:33,089
I'll crush her head like an egg.

123
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:35,634
Hey. What is this?

124
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:39,262
You said you wouldn't touch Mio!

125
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:44,976
Don't get so upset.
Everyone will die tomorrow, anyway.

126
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,395
What are you saying?

127
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:51,525
The last meal at
the summer festival tomorrow…

128
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,401
will heal Heine's body…

129
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:56,154
and Mother will live again.

130
00:11:56,988 --> 00:12:03,912
Everything will be back to normal,
just how Father planned it, right?

131
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:10,293
We appreciate the Hishigatas' support.
However, that shall end soon.

132
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,380
You betrayed us.

133
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,132
-What will you do to us?
-Tokiko!

134
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:20,804
Whoa!

135
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,852
Brother…

136
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:30,438
Your father is aware of all of this.

137
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,081
<i>No. I can't stay conscious.</i>

138
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:50,834
<i>Sis…</i>

139
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:59,593
Hey, are you okay? You're all bloody!

140
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:05,307
<i>Totsumura. Thank goodness. He's human.</i>

141
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:08,643
<i>I'm done for.</i>

142
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:12,230
<i>I'm sorry, Sis.</i>

143
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,946
Ryunosuke.

144
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,618
You were at Ushio's funeral,
the lady with the H-cup boobs.

145
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,620
They're G, dummy!

146
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,623
Where is Mio Kofune?

147
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,417
She was with you.

148
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:35,962
A-A monster took her.

149
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:39,883
These monster babies showed up.

150
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,177
Where's your gun?

151
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,849
I dropped it somewhere.
I took it out and shot at them.

152
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:55,315
I fell, then I ran.
I don't remember anything after that.

153
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,652
Running was the right choice.

154
00:13:58,735 --> 00:13:59,569
What?

155
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,614
I need your help.

156
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:08,411
I can't walk anymore.
So I need you to carry me.

157
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:10,872
Ah… I'll take you to a hospital
right away…

158
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:16,086
No, take me to the deepest part
of this cave.

159
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:22,634
<i>No.</i>

160
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:27,639
<i>I can't let this be real.</i>

161
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:28,974
Ushioh.

162
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:34,020
Come here. Slowly.

163
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:38,692
I won't forgive you!

164
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:43,571
Who cares if you won't?
Do you want Mio to die?

165
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:46,282
Come.

166
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,329
Stop.

167
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:57,961
Don't touch her.
If you want to eat humans, eat me!

168
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:05,760
No point in dying in style.

169
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:16,563
I was wrong to call you a dud.

170
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:20,275
You couldn't defeat Negoro if you were.

171
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:25,447
You're not broken.
In fact, you've evolved.

172
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,159
It's a waste to erase you.

173
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:32,412
Instead, I'll fix your head and use you.

174
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,749
I need labor for tomorrow.

175
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,211
No! Shinpei!

176
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:41,838
Please stop!

177
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:46,593
What? I guess I can't erase his power.

178
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:50,972
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

179
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,808
It's all a loop.

180
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:55,769
Not fair!

181
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:03,526
Your right eye can step back and see
the flow of time from a higher dimension.

182
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:07,030
<i>It observes multiple parallel worlds.</i>

183
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:11,534
So, Shinpei.

184
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:16,581
You can make the world you observe
into reality.

185
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:20,168
You are rendering this world.

186
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:24,089
Truly the terrifying power of a god.

187
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:28,134
However, you are not skilled
in using that power.

188
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:34,599
<i>You can't activate it unless
you lose self-awareness by dying.</i>

189
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:40,772
In other words,
we just need to not kill you.

190
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:43,024
How simple.

191
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:56,996
Just keep breathing here
until tomorrow ends…

192
00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:59,624
in deep despair.

193
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:05,630
Mio…

194
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:06,631
<i>It's hopeless.</i>

195
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:11,803
<i>If I can't loop, I can't redo anything.</i>

196
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:17,100
<i>I'm breaking that promise again.
I'm not protecting anyone.</i>

197
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:23,148
I'm sorry, Mio. I'm sorry, Ushio.

198
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:30,989
Eek! Am I interrupting?

199
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:32,365
Totsumu…

200
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,580
<i>Ms. Nagumo!</i>

201
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,836
<i>That's my last shot!</i>

202
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:56,890
Eek!

203
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:04,105
That was close!
I almost let her kill you, Shinpei.

204
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:08,318
Totsumura, Ms. Nagumo…

205
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,779
Nothing can get in our way now.

206
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:15,491
Thank you.

207
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:17,452
What?

208
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,622
MERCURY (II) CHLORIDE

209
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:24,584
I was able to… drink it.

210
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,461
What? You…

211
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,671
Shinpei.

212
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,425
Listen to me.

213
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:39,307
If one of us dies or gets fatally hurt…

214
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,392
I will immediately loop back.

215
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:42,602
-What?
-What?

216
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,940
You will kill yourself? How?

217
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,275
I'll use this.

218
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:53,738
You… brought the mercury (II) chloride.

219
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,699
How much of this is fatal?

220
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:59,202
Even a drop would do the trick.

221
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:02,747
Then drinking the whole bottle
will do it for sure.

222
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, but you'll suffer.

223
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,126
POISON
MERCURY (II) CHLORIDE

224
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,463
Yes. Let's hope I never use it.

225
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,265
Is this poison? You know how to die.

226
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:25,728
Don't tell me you've come here many times?

227
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,819
I don't even have to come often
to deal with you.

228
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:37,407
Wow, I didn't think
you would have the guts.

229
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:44,622
Listen… I will redo this many, many times.

230
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:52,630
In the end… I will defeat you.

231
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:55,675
F-For sure.

232
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:57,510
Hey!

233
00:19:57,593 --> 00:20:02,473
There's nothing I can do now.
I'm sorry, Heine.

234
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,559
Forget him.

235
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:05,768
What?

236
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:12,525
Look at her. She's been repairing
the damage I inflicted on her.

237
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:17,947
Shinpei is giving his life…

238
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:23,369
so I can't just go down easily!

239
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:28,082
She's actually eroding me now!

240
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,919
It can't be. Are you the egg?

241
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,423
Kill her! Don't worry about me!

242
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:40,094
She disappeared?

243
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:46,309
That bastard… He took her.

244
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:51,856
Ushioh!

245
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:53,274
Shinpei!

246
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:56,861
You'll be okay. I won't let go!

247
00:20:56,986 --> 00:21:01,449
I'm sorry, Shinpei. It's all my fault.
Everyone, even Mio…

248
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,575
No!

249
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:08,122
Don't look back. Just look at the present.

250
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:13,961
We will defeat them.
Even if it costs me my life.

251
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:20,176
I'll go anywhere.
As many times as you want me to.

252
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:22,929
I'll be with you, Shinpei.

253
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:33,231
In other words, you are a time traveler.

254
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:37,527
Yes.

255
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,444
Yes?

256
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:51,207
Yes. We just returned from the future.

257
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,002
JULY 22
(FIFTH LOOP)

258
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
