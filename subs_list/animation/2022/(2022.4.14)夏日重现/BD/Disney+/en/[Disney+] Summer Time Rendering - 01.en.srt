1
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:18,332
Hey, Shinpei.

2
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:19,333
Hmm?

3
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,377
Close your eyes for a sec.

4
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,588
Hey! What?

5
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:27,049
Okay. Open them.

6
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,884
What did you do?

7
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:29,969
It's a gift.

8
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:32,012
I don't get it.

9
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:35,891
Shinpei, when was the last time
you came home?

10
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:41,063
After my junior high graduation,
so two years ago.

11
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:44,692
Good grief. You didn't even
come home for New Year's.

12
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:46,527
Sorry.

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,737
Tell everyone I said "Hi"
when you go back.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,533
What do you mean?
You're coming with me, Ushio.

15
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:53,951
I can't go.

16
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:59,123
Shinpei. Find me.

17
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:02,334
Huh? Wait! Don't go!

18
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:06,005
Take good care of Mio.

19
00:01:07,464 --> 00:01:08,716
Ushio!

20
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:11,135
Ah.

21
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:13,262
Uh…

22
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:16,223
Huh?

23
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:20,019
Ah.

24
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:24,690
Whoa! Ah!

25
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:27,985
Sorry! I didn't mean to do that!

26
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,114
I-I am very sorry!

27
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:33,824
HITOGASHIMA

28
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:36,160
PORT KADA - HITOGASHIMA

29
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:41,999
<i>That weird dream almost
totally ruined my life.</i>

30
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,713
<i>I need to calm down. At times like these…</i>

31
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,133
<i>I need to step back from myself
and calm down.</i>

32
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:55,679
<i>That was the first time
I've ever gotten slapped.</i>

33
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:58,057
<i>Okay. I feel calm.</i>

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,309
<i>We will soon be arriving in Hitogashima.</i>

35
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:01,518
Oh.

36
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:07,274
<i>Hitogashima lies in the Kitan Strait
in Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture.</i>

37
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:15,407
<i>With a population of around 700, it is
known for Yomogimochi and Salted Squid.</i>

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,495
<i>It is a small island supported by
tourism and fishery.</i>

39
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:24,208
<i>I've come home for the first time
in two years.</i>

40
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:32,299
<i>I'm back in my hometown…</i>

41
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,428
<i>for my childhood friend, Ushio Kofune.</i>

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,098
<i>I'm attending her funeral.</i>

00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:46,105
{\an8}JULY 22

44
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,697
Hey!

45
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,866
Welcome home, Shinpei! Hey!

46
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,076
Mio?

47
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:02,788
Hope you had a nice trip!

48
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,457
Ah!

49
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,462
Hey! What are you doing?

50
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:17,928
I was all sweaty,
so I thought I'd take a dip.

51
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,431
Well, I'm glad to see you're well.

52
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:26,812
<i>Mio Kofune is Ushio's little sister.</i>

53
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:31,233
<i>There's no way she can be well
so soon after her sister died.</i>

54
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:36,655
<i>"Take care of Mio," huh?</i>

55
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:38,615
Come on.

56
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,286
You okay?

57
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,833
The sea is so salty.

58
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:54,798
How's Tokyo? Been to Shibuya? Shibuya!

59
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:56,800
Nah, I don't go out much.

60
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:59,928
Achoo! I got snot on my towel.

61
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,388
Too much information.

62
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:04,350
-Yes. Bring that.
-Super busy.

63
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:07,895
The restaurant is always busy
during summer.

64
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:10,773
It brings too many strangers here, though.

65
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:15,736
Recently, even the people I know
sometimes feel like strangers.

66
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:17,446
Oh.

67
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:21,116
So many tourists come during this season.

68
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:23,494
Heh, heh.

69
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,411
What?

70
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,623
Shinpei! You sound like a real Tokyo boy!

71
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:29,333
Huh? Me?

72
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,876
It really rubbed off on you.

73
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,628
Huh? No way!

74
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,051
<i>We walked to the funeral home
talking about nothing particular.</i>

75
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:41,053
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:18,233
USHIO KOFUNE FUNERAL CEREMONY

77
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,533
<i>When I lost my parents ten years ago,
the Kofune family took me in.</i>

78
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:28,202
{\an8}GOODBYE, SUMMER DAYS

79
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:33,457
{\an8}<i>That's why Ushio was both
a childhood friend and a sister to me.</i>

80
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:39,505
<i>The day before I left the island,
Ushio wanted me to make curry for her.</i>

81
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,466
<i>But I just said, "Maybe next time."</i>

82
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:47,179
<i>There was no "next time."</i>

83
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:53,685
How sad. It must be so hard for Shinpei.

84
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:56,813
Did you hear? Ushio's body…

85
00:06:57,523 --> 00:07:00,776
Dr. Hishigata did the autopsy.

86
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:04,279
Autopsy? That is serious!

87
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:06,740
Huh?

88
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:10,244
Who was that? No photos in here.

89
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:11,453
<i>A flash?</i>

90
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:13,121
-Ugh!
-Shinpei!

91
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:15,916
You finally came back!

92
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:16,833
Sou!

93
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:21,755
Ushio tried to save a drowning child.

94
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:26,843
She was swept away. I was there, but…

95
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:30,681
I'm so sorry, Shinpei. Please…

96
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,142
hit me as much as you want.

97
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:42,609
I won't do anything like that.

98
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:47,072
Seeing everyone crying
makes me rather calm.

99
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:49,533
Sh-Shinpei!

100
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:52,536
{\an8}HITOGASHIMA HALL

101
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:56,373
Hey, Sou. I heard…

102
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,209
your old man did the autopsy on Ushio.

103
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,713
But it was an accident at sea, right?

104
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,257
See that girl?

105
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:12,055
Shiori Kobayakawa.
You know, from Koba Mart.

106
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,725
Oh. She got big.

107
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,518
She's in third grade now.

108
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:21,481
The girl whom Ushio died trying to save…

109
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,442
was Shiori.

110
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:25,444
I see.

111
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,487
Poor girl.

112
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:31,283
She was so shocked by the accident that
she's been unable to speak ever since.

113
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,367
How awful…

114
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,041
It is time to carry the coffin.

115
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:45,339
Shinpei. May you lend a hand?

116
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:46,506
Yes!

117
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:50,093
I'll call you tonight
to tell you the rest.

118
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,053
Okay.

119
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,055
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

120
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:11,156
BISTRO KOFUNE

121
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:21,375
Ah. Sorry I took so long
to get back, Shinpei.

122
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,626
Welcome back, Alain.

123
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:23,960
Welcome home!

124
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:27,589
That Mr. Karikiri sure can talk.

125
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:32,010
Mio. Why aren't you helping?

126
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,304
My job is eating!

127
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:36,264
It's almost finished.

128
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:39,976
Smells great. Ushio used to love that.

129
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,688
Mio, could you set the table?

130
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:46,149
There's a plate for Sis too.

131
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:51,655
It has been so long since
I had your curry!

132
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,033
Thank you for this meal.

133
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:11,883
Hmm?

134
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:18,682
Huh? What are you up to, Mio?

135
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,517
Staring at your own house.

136
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:23,770
You get into a fight with someone?

137
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:34,948
Right.

138
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:36,658
Okay.

139
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:40,162
So, why did she need an autopsy?

140
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:41,329
<i>Ah.</i>

141
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:45,375
<i>That's just a rumor.
There was no full autopsy.</i>

142
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:48,587
<i>My old man helped the police</i>
<i>examine her body.</i>

HISHIGATA CLINIC

144
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,381
<i>Yeah? So, it's nothing.</i>

145
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,466
But…

146
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,429
<i>they found ligature marks on her neck.</i>

147
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,139
<i>Ligature marks?</i>

148
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:00,390
Yeah.

149
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:02,726
Marks from someone strangling her.

150
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,898
<i>In other words, it could've been a murder.</i>

151
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,112
<i>On that day…</i>

152
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:16,656
<i>we went to the beach
by the elementary school…</i>

153
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,075
<i>where tourists don't go.</i>

154
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:24,539
<i>Ushio noticed Shiori drowning offshore
and she jumped in.</i>

155
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:29,336
<i>Mio and I also jumped in soon after,
but didn't see anyone suspicious.</i>

156
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:32,464
<i>Do people know about the ligature marks?</i>

157
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:33,590
Of course not!

158
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:39,346
<i>Only Mio, Alain, the police,
and my old man know about it.</i>

159
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:43,558
<i>But given the situation,
the police said murder is impossible.</i>

160
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:46,895
They called it an accidental death
and closed the case.

161
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,481
I see.

162
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:51,942
Huh?

163
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,320
I see. Thank you.

164
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:00,575
Oh. Mio.

165
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,579
This is the necklace Sis had on that day.

166
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,587
I think you should have it.

167
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:15,507
Ushio's…

168
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,554
H-Hey. What's going on?

169
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,306
Dry yourself properly.

170
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,975
Hey, Shinpei.

171
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:38,363
I won't see Sis ever again.

172
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:44,578
I hate that. I hate it!

173
00:12:47,372 --> 00:12:52,210
I'll never forgive the one who killed her.

174
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:58,174
H-Hey Mio. Do you know something?

175
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,514
Come on!

176
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:09,311
Sorry. It's nothing. Take a bath.

177
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:14,858
Sis would get mad to see me
crying like this.

178
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,485
No more crying from tomorrow on.

179
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,628
Pretty.

180
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:40,800
Shinpei! Thanks!
I'll take good care of it!

181
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:46,014
She held on to it all this time.

BISTRO KOFUNE

183
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,367
JULY 23

184
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:14,960
<i>It is best to keep busy
to cope with a loss.</i>

185
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:18,505
<i>I am sure Alain and Mio think so.</i>

186
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:20,924
<i>So did I.</i>

187
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:23,468
-Shinpei!
-Yes?

188
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,680
Did ya find who you were looking for?

189
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:29,391
Huh? I was looking for someone?

190
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:31,810
You said so this morning.

191
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:36,106
You were looking for this woman
with glasses and big boobs.

192
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,733
Huh? Are you sure that was me?

193
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:39,734
Huh?

194
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:43,363
You've had too much to drink,
Mr. Nakamura.

195
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:44,823
Welcome!

196
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:49,077
Ah! It's so hot!

197
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:51,579
Gimme the usual.

198
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,499
What a day.

199
00:14:56,793 --> 00:15:00,171
<i>This is Tetsu Totsumura.
He is a relative of the Kofunes…</i>

200
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:04,467
<i>and a police officer at
the only station on the island.</i>

201
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,094
WEEKLY SUPER H

202
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,887
Sorry. The usual?

203
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:11,016
Whoa! If that isn't Shinpei!

204
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:14,352
About Ushio, well, you know…

205
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,563
Tetsu! Welcome.

206
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,982
Mio. Looking cute as always!

207
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:22,777
Your usual Lunch Special
with fried shrimp and medium rice?

208
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:25,363
Correct!

209
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,323
What happened this morning?

210
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:29,826
You didn't come for breakfast.

211
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:34,497
That's right. Listen to this.
Serious business.

212
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:39,502
The entire Kobayakawa family disappeared.

213
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:42,047
Ah. Kobaya…

214
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,427
<i>Shiori Kobayakawa.
The girl whom Ushio died trying to save…</i>

215
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,305
Disappeared?

216
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,809
Koba Mart wasn't open
at eight this morning…

217
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:59,272
so their neighbor Shiomi took a peek
inside their house.

218
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,192
It was completely empty inside!

219
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:08,114
Well, that store was under loads of debt.

220
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:11,576
They might just be running
from their lenders.

221
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:13,620
Oh!

222
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:16,206
Hey, Mio!

223
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,584
Where are you going?

224
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,754
{\an8}LUNCH SPECIALS

225
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,130
Here you go.

226
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:25,298
Oh!

227
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,474
DAILY GOODS
KOBA MART

228
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:38,686
YOMOGIMOCHI

229
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:46,653
They just came to the funeral yesterday.

230
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:48,488
The Kobayakawa family.

231
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:50,448
Yeah.

232
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,249
Sorry for leaving during lunch.

233
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,250
It's fine.

234
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:04,379
Shiori has been acting strange.

235
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,341
I heard she stopped talking
after the accident.

236
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:09,759
No.

237
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:10,802
Huh?

238
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:15,390
It was before that. Maybe last week?
She said something strange.

239
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:19,686
She said she saw something when she went
bug catching on Mount Takanosu.

240
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:21,896
Saw what?

241
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:26,943
A girl who looked just like Shiori.

242
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:36,077
After that, she felt like
she was being watched everywhere.

243
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:41,124
What does that mean? Like a doppelgänger?

244
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:44,085
That's gotta be a shadow.

245
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,008
Who is this?

246
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:52,135
Nezu. A fisherman.

247
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,096
Shadow sickness.

248
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:57,557
Shadow?

249
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,269
It's a local disease
passed down on this island.

250
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:05,815
Hadn't heard of too many people
seeing it recently…

251
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:08,484
but it was quite common before the war.

252
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:14,574
If you get the shadow sickness,
you start seeing the shadow.

253
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:17,619
Those who see the shadow dies.

254
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:20,955
The shadow kills them.

255
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,751
Then the shadow pretends
to be that person…

256
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,670
and kills their whole family.

257
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:29,047
That's the legend.

258
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:36,638
Folks who caught the shadow sickness
had to be purified by Hiruko.

259
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:39,224
My gramps used to say that.

260
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:43,186
What was that about?

261
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,396
Hey, Shinpei.

262
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,191
When I was little…

263
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:50,443
my grandma said the same thing.

264
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:53,571
Do you know about the shadows?

265
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:57,283
No, but it's a superstition, right?

266
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,453
Right. But…

267
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:03,998
I saw it. Sis's shadow.

268
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,919
It was three days before she died.

269
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:12,382
<i>We went to a cleaning event
at Omotohama Beach.</i>

270
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:17,595
<i>It was then…</i>

271
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:19,806
Look, Mio.

272
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,896
No way! You shouldn't make
jokes like that!

273
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,981
But it's true!

274
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:30,984
It quickly disappeared before our eyes.

275
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:34,404
Then three days later, Sis…

276
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:38,574
I'm worried about Shiori and her family.

277
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,453
<i>Calm down. I need to calm down.</i>

278
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:48,751
Mio. Did you tell anyone about this?

279
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,552
No more crying after last night, remember?

280
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:05,226
Let's go see Hiruko
and ask about the shadows.

281
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:11,649
About what that guy just told us?
Purification.

282
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,526
Come on.

283
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,116
Shinpei.

284
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:29,584
<i>Hiruko is the nickname for Hito Shrine,
at the northern part of the island.</i>

285
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,434
No answer.

286
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:53,274
No one's here.
Maybe we can try the shrine.

287
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,068
Mio?

288
00:20:58,613 --> 00:20:59,530
What's the matter?

289
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,953
Wait! Did you see that?

290
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:07,330
Not clearly.

291
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:10,541
-I feel like it was Shiori.
-What?

292
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:14,253
-Let's follow her! Quickly!
-Ah!

293
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:24,680
She's not here.

294
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,141
Did she go farther?

295
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:31,104
The old fort is up there.
It's too dangerous.

296
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:33,898
Mio, let's take a step back
from ourselves and think.

297
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:36,275
There it is! Your step-back method!

298
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:40,405
If that was Shiori,
why would she run from us?

299
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:42,740
You're right. I wonder why.

300
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:44,742
Ah!

301
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:45,993
A gunshot?

302
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:09,392
<i>I saw her on the boat.</i>

303
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:12,812
Shinpei! Don't just stand there!

304
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:15,231
She's bleeding! Look!

305
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:17,817
What should we do, Shinpei?

306
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,777
I messed up.

307
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:21,654
I'll go get help!

308
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:23,948
Mio! Ugh!

309
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:28,327
Listen closely.

310
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:31,622
It…

311
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:43,384
Didn't Dad always say?

312
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,056
Shinpei.

313
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,019
Until you wash the dishes
and wipe the table…

314
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:57,190
you're not done cooking.

315
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:15,708
Ushio!

316
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:20,963
Huh?

317
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:54,932
