1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,024
{\an8}No!

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,581
{\an8}Although it's her original hair,
it's not enough for her to recover.

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,961
{\an8}She's turning into a child.

4
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:23,796
{\an8}She's in a bad condition.

5
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:27,883
Shide.

6
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:42,148
{\an8}Her nerves and muscles are worn out.
Ushioh can't fight anymore.

7
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:46,068
{\an8}Darn it. If only I had
the power to erase it.

8
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:50,781
{\an8}Ryunosuke, can you get into Shide's armor?

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,241
{\an8}What?

10
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:57,830
{\an8}It's too much?
But that's the only option I see.

11
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,916
<i>Don't turn around, Ryu.</i>

12
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,379
<i>Shide can't hear our silent voices.</i>

13
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,340
<i>Both of you, listen to me.</i>

14
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:13,596
{\an8}<i>I will put all my energy into
turning the shots into hacking bullets.</i>

15
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:16,265
<i>But it will take two minutes to do that.</i>

16
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:19,977
<i>I need you to buy me that time.</i>

17
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:23,189
{\an8}Having a secret strategy meeting?

18
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,233
{\an8}Let me join you.

19
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:32,656
It's fine. Shide can't read memories.

20
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:38,037
He only had weapons
because Hiruko was beside him.

21
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:41,248
You've changed, Haine.

22
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,169
{\an8}I never expected you to betray me.

23
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,964
{\an8}You are the one who changed!

24
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:54,053
Everything went wrong
after that whale drifted ashore!

25
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:59,767
{\an8}I haven't changed at all.
It was just enlightenment.

26
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:05,231
I realized that I must be faithful
to my own desire to live!

27
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:12,947
<i>In the beginning,
I just wanted us to be together.</i>

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,075
<i>That's all.</i>

29
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:19,328
<i>Two minutes. Shinpei.</i>

30
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:22,539
<i>Give it your all for just two minutes.</i>

31
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:33,676
<i>There's no going back.
I'll give him all I've got.</i>

32
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:38,931
<i>He is just rushing us.</i>

33
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:45,562
<i>That's fine. Let him think
that the shotgun is worthless.</i>

34
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,906
Darn! The shotgun won't stop him!

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,908
Ushioh! Change weapons!

36
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,961
<i>Good thing I like to copy everything.</i>

37
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:11,755
Even Hizuru's sledgehammer!

38
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,007
Thank you.

39
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,467
Now I can still fight.

40
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:21,557
Everything ends if you die.

41
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,186
You can't use foresight or loop.

42
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:31,942
You have to give the last boss a chance.

43
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:39,158
<i>One more minute.</i>

44
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:45,539
<i>I see. Both are right-handed. Hard to use.</i>

45
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:49,418
<i>The first attack came back.
This is the echo.</i>

46
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,386
Shide's left arm...

47
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,471
It grew back!

48
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,932
<i>He just copied his right arm
to make his left.</i>

49
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,143
<i>My erase is working.</i>

50
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,103
<i>Keep it up, Ryu.</i>

51
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,188
<i>Yes!</i>

52
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:16,111
<i>If I attack, it echoes back.
But if I stop, Shide will go for Ushioh.</i>

53
00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:22,409
<i>Attack! Keep attacking!
Don't give him room to breathe!</i>

54
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:36,632
<i>Darn it! I could only punch him.</i>

55
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:43,097
<i>This is the bullet.</i>

56
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,390
<i>Ryu, no!</i>

57
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:46,809
<i>Behind you!</i>

58
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,146
<i>This is bad. Dodge it...</i>

59
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,571
<i>Step back.</i>

60
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,532
<i>Step back!</i>

61
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,285
<i>Those are shell casings.</i>

62
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:11,125
<i>They haven't hit the ground.
Is this how shadows feel time?</i>

63
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,629
<i>One second is so long.
It feels like forever.</i>

64
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,590
<i>How many more blows can I take?</i>

65
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:23,178
<i>When she finishes the hacking bullet,
will I be in the condition to shoot it?</i>

66
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:28,725
Darn it. Ushioh even cut half of his arms.

67
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:32,020
He's too good.
Much stronger than other shadows.

68
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:35,941
<i>I'm the only one who can shoot.</i>

69
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:40,404
<i>I'm... the only one!</i>

70
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:44,700
The advantage of age, Ryunosuke.

71
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:47,244
We can both fight like shadows,

72
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:50,539
but I've got many years on you.

73
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:53,459
<i>I'm sorry, Ushioh.</i>

74
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:58,088
<i>Even if you finish the hacking bullet,
no one can shoot it.</i>

75
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,549
<i>Ryu.</i>

76
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,179
Don't give up, Ryunosuke.
There is still a way.

77
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:10,058
It's time for the comeback of the ages.

78
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:13,812
Ushioh. I'll shoot the hacking bullet.

79
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:20,152
Ryunosuke.
You are good at possessing, right?

80
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,448
Can you take over Shide's armor
and stop his moves?

81
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:32,039
We just need a few seconds.
It should be easy since it's empty inside.

82
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:37,377
<i>Wait! You can't survive
without Ryu's support.</i>

83
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:44,259
<i>I know. We can keep dodging him,
but my body won't last five seconds.</i>

84
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:48,347
To do that, I need to touch the armor.

85
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:50,933
Can I get that close without dying?

86
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,893
Be confident.

87
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:56,355
I know you can do it.

88
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:00,400
<i>Odd.</i>

89
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:02,819
<i>Okay!</i>

90
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,283
<i>Even without the foresight,
he escapes a fatal blow.</i>

91
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,911
<i>I'll try it, Shinpei!</i>

92
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:16,875
Listen. You can replicate
any movement that you see.

93
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,546
Nezu will show you how to shoot.

94
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:27,052
<i>I'm relying on you, Ryunosuke.</i>

95
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:31,306
<i>I'll detect everything!</i>

96
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:35,102
<i>I'll weave past a fatal attack.</i>

97
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,109
<i>I can do it!</i>

98
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:48,865
He's in.

99
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,370
Good work, Ryunosuke.

100
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:05,549
Are you trying to control my armor?

101
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:07,801
You got it wrong, you bastard!

102
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,640
I'll never let go of you, but I hate you!

103
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:20,814
Good. Just stop its movement.

104
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,072
<i>This is bad. I almost passed out.</i>

105
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,535
<i>Is this the pain that Ryunosuke held back?</i>

106
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:38,332
<i>Hang in there, Shinpei!
Just a while longer!</i>

107
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:44,713
<i>Right, Ushioh.
Your voice relieves my pain.</i>

108
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,508
<i>I can move a little more.</i>

109
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:50,969
Well, well.

110
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:56,391
Your hate makes me sad. I like you.

111
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:58,894
Ryunosuke.

112
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:05,525
<i>Ryu!</i>

113
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:10,280
Did you intend for Ryunosuke to
destroy my armor?

114
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:13,116
Not a terrible idea.

115
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,785
However,

116
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:18,580
I took it upon myself
to break Ryunosuke apart.

117
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:25,128
You can prepare if you know beforehand.
You often did that yourself.

118
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,005
<i>What?</i>

119
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:32,094
What do you mean you knew?

120
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:37,808
You didn't see the battle at Torajima.

121
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:40,977
You made it like it never existed,

122
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:46,274
but Hizuru tried to use
the same exact strategy.

123
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,615
I have to admit. I love loops!

124
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,995
<i>The shotgun is two meters away.</i>

125
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:06,086
<i>Three steps, but can I reach it?
A human like me, faster than Shide?</i>

126
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,136
Your body is starting to break apart!
Darn it!

127
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:18,682
It is nice to just watch you fall apart.

128
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:26,106
But before I take the eye from Ushioh,
I should kill you myself.

129
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:29,818
That sounds so much more satisfying.

130
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,407
You won't get Ushioh's eye.

131
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,995
She will give me her eye.

132
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:44,583
The fact that I still have it is proof
that the ending is decided.

133
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,544
Ushioh will win in the end!

134
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,380
Ending?

135
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:55,469
I just want to live forever. That's all.

136
00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:01,558
I want to see this world.
The future. The end of man.

137
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,810
The ending of everything.

138
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:08,231
That was possible with Heine.

139
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:13,028
I have lived for 326 years 24 days

140
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:16,114
by switching bodies.

141
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:19,618
<i>However, Heine got weaker.</i>

142
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:23,747
<i>When I learned my life
would end with Masahito,</i>

143
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:27,751
<i>I was filled with despair.</i>

144
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:32,756
You cannot imagine.

145
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:38,970
But... I changed my thinking
a few months ago.

146
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:45,894
If I can't see the end,
I should just end the world with me.

147
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:52,442
If the world ended,
I could see the ending of this world.

148
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:57,531
If I could revive Hiruko's eye
for even a little,

149
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:01,785
I could steal that and erase the world.

150
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:07,332
I know how to turn off the power
from the game console.

151
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:10,418
I am the boss, after all, Shinpei.

152
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:13,630
Even if you know that,
you can't change the ending.

153
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:18,176
I shall steal the eye
and overwrite the future.

154
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,763
I shall reach the ending!

155
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:31,606
<i>It's done!</i>

156
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:36,862
<i>The bullet is loaded! Go for it, Shinpei!</i>

157
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,532
<i>Wait for me, Ushioh. Here I come!</i>

158
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:44,286
Don't waste your effort, Shinpei!

159
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:50,458
Everything you have done is in vain!

160
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:53,420
<i>It's... no good?</i>

161
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,006
No, you won't make it.

162
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:57,757
Move.

163
00:12:58,675 --> 00:12:59,593
Move.

164
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,178
Move!

165
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:03,763
Move, please!

166
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:08,518
Just a little! Get closer to Shinpei!

167
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:12,606
Huh?

168
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,107
He reached it!

169
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:20,405
Haine! You're the best!

170
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:24,910
<i>Shinpei's right eye has Shide.</i>

171
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:29,289
<i>When he steps back,
he syncs with shadow movements.</i>

172
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:33,543
<i>Since I had been moving him,
his nervous system is active.</i>

173
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,671
He just needs to move his body!

174
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:43,178
You can do it, Shinpei!
You've come this far! You can do it!

175
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:48,099
<i>That's right, Ryunosuke.
Nothing is in vain.</i>

176
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:53,396
<i>Everyone helped to get me here.
No one was meaningless.</i>

177
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:55,273
<i>I won't allow that.</i>

178
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:02,405
<i>He fell... No, he evaded me.</i>

179
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,908
<i>You all brought me here.</i>

180
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,412
Now I am here!

181
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,916
It's like Sis said.

182
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:15,877
The one who will save everyone...

183
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:18,588
is Shinpei!

184
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,270
That bullet...

185
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:40,235
You are so stubborn... Ushioh...

186
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:45,073
This is the end, Shide.

187
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:49,285
We will live.

188
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,038
S-Stop...

189
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:57,377
After you disappear,
the world will continue as always.

190
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:07,012
<i>If Hiruko is erased,
my armor will disappear.</i>

191
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:10,849
<i>I can't move. I can't see.</i>

192
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:13,309
<i>No!</i>

193
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,230
<i>No!</i>

194
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,776
Heine...

195
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:29,576
Ah... This is my ending.

196
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:52,265
Shinpei...

197
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,727
You did it.

198
00:15:56,895 --> 00:16:02,025
Yeah... Everyone will survive now...

199
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:17,207
Ow. Ouchy.

200
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,793
I'll end it, Hiruko.

201
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,651
My body...

202
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:48,571
Shinpei, behind you.

203
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:06,131
What is this place?

204
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,263
This place is...

205
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,265
the real world.

206
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:21,020
But... 300 years ago.

207
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:22,647
What, 300...

208
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:26,526
Hiruko connected the exit of
the everlasting night with this beach.

209
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:31,364
Our bodies are far away.
Only our data is here.

210
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:39,873
<i>I could see the past during loops.
Is this the same as that?</i>

211
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,505
That child...

212
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,800
It's me. The real me.

213
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:57,140
I see. Ushioh. Please erase Hiruko now!

214
00:17:57,724 --> 00:17:59,851
That whale is Hiruko in the past.

215
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:05,356
It wants to move its data back
and start everything again.

216
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:11,821
Wait! Stay away from the whale!
You'll be killed!

217
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:14,365
I can't touch her.

218
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:18,786
What?

219
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:23,249
Don't touch the god. Go get a grown-up.

220
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,839
It's a ghost!

221
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,258
I guess I scared her.

222
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,552
Amazing. You touched the past.

223
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:40,141
The awakened power in that eye
changed the past.

224
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,565
Oh, okay.

225
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,734
Please take the little one.

226
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:53,071
What are you doing, Ushioh?

227
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:02,664
As long as this one drifts ashore here,

228
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:06,960
the same thing will happen
even if I erase her.

229
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:11,589
I need to erase this Hiruko.

230
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:14,550
She didn't want to redo it.

231
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,763
She called me here to end it.

232
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:22,225
Thank... you...

233
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:29,732
Good night. Bye bye.

234
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:42,036
Thank you.

235
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,793
Thank you, Ushioh. Thank you, Shinpei.

236
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,877
Haine.

237
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:54,841
Ryunosuke, if I am reborn,

238
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:57,510
can we be friends?

239
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:03,599
Yeah! Of course!
I'll bring plenty of snacks!

240
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:07,312
I'm sure Sis would also...

241
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:35,173
Ushioh.

242
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,969
I guess this is goodbye, Shinpei.

243
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,722
Wait!

244
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:46,601
I'll come with you. We can be together.

245
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:52,106
With Hiruko gone,
all the shadows will disappear.

246
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:55,443
My right eye is normal now.

247
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:59,072
I'll die once I return to my body.

248
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:05,119
I want to disappear along with you.

249
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:08,748
Dummy.

250
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,628
You're giving me second thoughts.

251
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:21,469
You need to go back! Everyone is waiting.
Don't worry.

252
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,306
I'll send you back to 2018.

253
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:32,647
These three days were really
scary and stressful.

254
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:38,069
But more than that,
I was happy to spend time with you!

255
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,909
Well? How about you?

256
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:53,626
Me too. I'm glad I could see you!

257
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:09,392
I was so happy, Ushioh.

258
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:20,361
<i>The power to cross time.
I finally figured it out.</i>

259
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:22,989
<i>This wasn't a coincidence.</i>

260
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:28,578
<i>That strong desire to see someone again
linked Haine and me.</i>

261
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:34,083
{\an8}<i>With the power given to me,
I'll jump back and rewrite that summer.</i>

262
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:38,463
{\an8}<i>I need to hurry!
Before this body disappears!</i>

263
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,688
RECORDING

264
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:48,783
Find me.

265
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,828
Take good care of Mio.

266
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:57,166
I have to go now.

267
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:01,128
Come to this ending.

268
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:06,884
<i>Everyone is waiting for you at the end.</i>

269
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:11,430
<i>I am waiting for you!</i>

270
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:17,603
Ushio!

271
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:23,985
{\an8}Huh?

272
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,069
