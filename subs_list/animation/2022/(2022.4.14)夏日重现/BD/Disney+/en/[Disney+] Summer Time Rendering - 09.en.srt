1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,651
What's this? A view?

2
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:06,487
Isn't this the same beach we're at?

3
00:00:06,654 --> 00:00:07,780
Looks like it.

4
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:09,615
<i>Shinpei?</i>

5
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:15,121
<i>Or Mio? Or someone else?</i>

6
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:18,124
<i>Anyways, I'll just talk
assuming you're Shinpei.</i>

7
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:24,046
<i>If you are watching this,
I'm not in this world any more.</i>

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,007
<i>You just wanted to say that line.</i>

9
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:28,342
<i>How did you know?</i>

10
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,219
Well, I know myself.

11
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:34,014
<i>Come here. Let's both be in it.</i>

12
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:36,392
What...

13
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:37,977
<i>Over here?</i>

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,353
<i>A little to the left.</i>

15
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:40,521
<i>Ushio and her shadow?</i>

16
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:41,564
<i>Oh, that's too much.</i>

17
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:42,731
<i>Perfect.</i>

18
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:44,525
<i>What are you doing?</i>

19
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:45,943
<i>Shinpei.</i>

20
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,404
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

21
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:52,908
<i>Only my shadow and I
can unlock this cell phone.</i>

22
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:57,163
<i>That means my shadow must be with you now.</i>

23
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,164
Oh...

24
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:01,208
<i>By the way, can you tell which one is me?</i>

25
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,419
<i>Hey! I'm talking here!</i>

26
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:06,881
Left? Or right?

27
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:08,883
They get along.

28
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,093
<i>-That doesn't matter!</i>
-That doesn't matter.

29
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:13,095
<i>-We are both me.</i>
-We are both me.

30
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:15,598
<i>I'm sure you know by now,</i>

31
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:20,186
<i>but that one is not evil
like the other shadows.</i>

32
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:24,064
<i>She's on your side, I promise!</i>

33
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,694
<i>My shadow will explain the details,</i>

34
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:32,656
<i>but I wanted to tell you directly, too.</i>

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,117
<i>That's why I'm doing this video.</i>

36
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:37,620
<i>What should I start with?</i>

37
00:01:37,703 --> 00:01:42,041
<i>Right. It all began with Shiori.</i>

38
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,924
{\an8}JULY 17

39
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:16,719
{\an8}It's more than a look-alike!

40
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:20,973
{\an8}I think someone followed me home
from school today, too.

41
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,728
{\an8}Is it a stalker? Be careful.
Should I tell Totsumura?

42
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:29,315
Totsumura can't help!
I know it's that girl.

43
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:33,777
Sis, is this the medicine
for Dad's athlete's foot?

44
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:35,279
Yeah, that's it.

45
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:38,240
You're not listening!
I should charge you double!

46
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:40,743
What is it? What's the problem?

47
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:43,287
Never mind then. Thanks for coming.

48
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:47,207
{\an8}JULY 18

49
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,174
Huh?

50
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,556
Mio, look.

51
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,516
Hm? Oh...

52
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:08,729
Who's there?

53
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,022
Huh?

54
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:12,524
Wait!

55
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,446
Did I lose her? Huh?

56
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:23,827
Ah...

57
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:25,788
Shadow...

58
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:26,789
Huh?

59
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:29,792
It's more than a look-alike!

60
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,465
A shadow?

61
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:41,011
Yeah, we'll look into your story
about the look-alike.

62
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,680
So you decided to believe me?

63
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:47,184
Yes, so don't worry anymore.

64
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:52,856
Omotohama trash collection
event is now concluded!

65
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,569
Thanks to you, the beach is clean
for its big opening tomorrow.

66
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:01,949
We will burn the collected trash
at the Omiokuri event.

67
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:07,454
Okay everyone, see you
at the summer festival on the 24th.

68
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:08,831
KOFUNE

69
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:12,418
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

70
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:14,378
Yay! I go first!

71
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:19,383
Hey, sis.

72
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:22,344
Will Shinpei be back this summer?

73
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:26,348
Huh? Who cares if he never comes back!

74
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:28,559
Yeah right, I know you like him.

75
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:29,476
Ah.

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,938
You like Shinpei.

77
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:35,691
-What are you saying?
-Stop it...

78
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:39,111
Move! I'm going to take a bath first!

79
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:49,663
Shinpei... I wonder what he's doing now?

80
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:55,669
Uh, whatever, forget him...

81
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:02,259
Hi.

82
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:05,596
Mio!

83
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:21,403
What are you?

84
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:25,532
Ow, you can't listen at all.

85
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:27,493
Did you follow us from Omotohama?

86
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:31,330
I'm Ushio Kofune.
I just came home to my own house!

87
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:35,042
Then... why were you hiding?

88
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,127
That's because you were with Mio.

89
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:38,962
{\an8}You are...

90
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:41,840
-Do you know about shadows?
-Do you know about shadows?

91
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,425
-You're the shadow.
-You're the shadow.

92
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,386
<i>Huh? What is this?</i>

93
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,016
{\an8}Wait a second. If shadows really exist...

94
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:56,563
Shiori's shadow is
somewhere on the island too!

95
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,149
I have a bad feeling.

96
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,192
Huh?

97
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:05,197
Didn't Shiori say she first saw
her shadow on Mt. Takanosu?

98
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:08,158
Shouldn't we check it out?

99
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:11,995
I guess. I'll deal with you later.

100
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,627
Why are you following me?

101
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,671
You're the one who's following.

102
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:26,426
I promised Shiori I'd look into this
so that she can stop worrying.

103
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,138
Make any strange moves,
and I'll finish you!

104
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:32,182
Got it?

105
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,606
<i>There are no leads.</i>

106
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,735
<i>I'm out of time today.
I need to hike down before it gets dark.</i>

107
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:44,736
Come here.

108
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:46,655
KEEP OUT

109
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,783
Look. There's a trail ahead.

110
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:52,160
This totally makes me want to go in.

111
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:53,704
I know, right!

112
00:07:59,042 --> 00:07:59,960
Ah...

113
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:05,382
Oh, this must be the old clinic
Sou's family had.

114
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:06,300
HISHIGATA CLINIC

115
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:08,927
<i>Rumor says
that this old clinic is haunted.</i>

116
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:13,348
<i>Everyone is afraid of it,
so they stay away.</i>

117
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:19,605
So scary! I hate ghosts!

118
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:20,522
You too?

119
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:26,194
Yet, you seem eager to go inside.
Aren't you scared?

120
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,990
I'm scared, but I have a feeling...

121
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:30,907
PRESCRIPTIONS

122
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,577
like I've been here before.

123
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,748
Who is it! Who's there?

124
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:11,114
<i>That's the shadow? It's got my face!</i>

125
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:16,620
Watch out!

126
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:18,914
What was that...

127
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:25,128
Let go! Damn! What is this?

128
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:26,838
Damn.

129
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:32,761
Let go of her! Let go!

130
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,698
What's happening?
It wasn't my leg that was stabbed!

131
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:55,158
Oh, I get it now.

132
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,204
<i>It's the shadow's weakness.</i>

133
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,876
<i>I know. My body clearly felt it.</i>

134
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:14,177
I am not human.

135
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,014
You're not getting away!

136
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,601
<i>My true body is the flat shadow.</i>

137
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,021
<i>This image of the body...</i>

138
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,571
<i>is a device to protect the true body.</i>

139
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,126
You...

140
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,378
What was that?

141
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,089
I...

142
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,468
That was amazing, super cool!

143
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,389
I know, right?

144
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:07,022
Wow! It healed.

145
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:10,066
I copied the data of your right foot.

146
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,735
So it's like data?

147
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,739
I don't know how to put it,
but it's like that.

148
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:19,159
But this copied data
will probably disappear.

149
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:22,537
If the original is deleted,
the copy becomes the original.

150
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:26,208
Deleted? Does that mean killed?

151
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,002
Will you disappear unless I die?

152
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,672
I just have that feeling in my head.

153
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:35,759
Normally,
I guess I'm supposed to kill you.

154
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:41,097
So that's why people say you die
once you see your shadow.

155
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,809
Shiori is in danger.

156
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,395
We have to do something about it.

157
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:52,692
JULY 20

158
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,784
So you must be with my shadow now.

159
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:06,456
<i>What will Shinpei think
when he finds out that I am fake?</i>

160
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,543
-By the way, can you tell which one is me?
-By the way, can you tell which one is me?

161
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,962
-Hey! I'm talking here!
-Hey! I'm talking here!

162
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:14,840
That doesn't matter.

163
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:17,717
We are both me.

164
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,900
Ushioh. You two tried to save Shiori.

165
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,365
I remember. I remember now!

166
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:42,325
Your memory...

167
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:44,077
Has it come back?

168
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:47,622
It's not just my memory.
My power came back too.

169
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:49,082
Power?

170
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:53,169
I want you to see the truth
of the end of my life.

171
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:57,007
I'll recreate it from my memory data.

172
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:04,347
Let's go to the private beach
on July 21st!

173
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,647
<i>This place...</i>

174
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,650
Hey, Shinpei, look!

175
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:18,570
I'm so glad it's sunny!

176
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:19,613
Right!

177
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:22,574
It is the perfect weather to study.

178
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,326
Perfect weather for swimming!

179
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:29,456
Hey, Shiori! I heard you can't swim.
How lame!

180
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,334
Hamaji, you can't even eat mushrooms!

181
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:35,837
I can't eat mushrooms,
but that's not lame!

182
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:37,631
Is that...

183
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:41,259
No doubt. That's us from the 21st.

184
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:44,554
Oh, I need to stop them! Hey!

185
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,056
It's pointless.

186
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,894
{\an8}This is just an image from the past.
We are just watching a recording.

187
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,147
We can't touch or speak to them.

188
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,690
Right, Ushioh?

189
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:56,608
Yes.

190
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,068
{\an8}Damn.

191
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,612
Where were you at this time?

192
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:02,113
Come with me.

193
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:09,663
One, two, three, four, five.

194
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,377
Have I put on some weight?

195
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:18,046
Don't say that. It's been bothering me.

196
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,007
This is where you copied the swimsuit.

197
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:22,676
Just watch.

198
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,054
I can't get near Shiori like this.

199
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,557
I have an idea. Can you turn into this?

200
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,018
Sure.

201
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,899
Okay. Well?

202
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,150
Perfect!

203
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:43,947
I turned into the shell necklace
and Ushio wore me.

204
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:48,410
I took off the real necklace
and put it in my pool bag.

205
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:50,370
Hey, Mio.

206
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:57,085
How can I be a good swimmer like you?
I want to learn!

207
00:14:57,168 --> 00:15:01,881
You will!
Let's do a swimming lesson today!

208
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:04,926
Who wants to learn how to swim?

209
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,011
Me!

210
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:08,263
<i>Shiori.</i>

211
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,265
That's the spirit!

212
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:12,100
Huh? Ah.

213
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:16,229
I'll protect you, no matter what.

214
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:19,691
Huh? What's that?
It's like a marriage proposal.

215
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:21,484
What?

216
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:23,528
What's wrong?

217
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,405
Akari says she pooped.

218
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,364
Uh-oh.

219
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:29,951
{\an8}I didn't!
I just need to go, it's coming out!

220
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,328
You want me to take you?

221
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:33,246
Hurry!

222
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:34,873
It's okay, I'll take her!

223
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:42,047
Shiori?

224
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,550
What's wrong?

225
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:47,927
Shiori's gone.

226
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:50,138
Look! There!

227
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,143
Ushio, it's in the water!
I can feel a shadow!

228
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:59,731
Tokiko, take Akari! Come, Sou!

229
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:01,149
Sure!

230
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:08,865
Shinpei, did you see what
happened to Shiori?

231
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,075
Ah, no.

232
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:13,411
Sorry, this is a memory.

233
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:16,122
I can't recreate what no one saw.

234
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,040
Stay back!

235
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:21,002
Don't come! Leave this to me!

236
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,171
Sis.

237
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:25,632
Don't be a fool, Ushio!
What are you thinking?

238
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:27,884
Hang in there, Shiori.

239
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:43,066
<i>I see it!</i>

240
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,737
<i>It's Shiori's shadow!</i>

241
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,823
<i>Here I go.</i>

242
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,283
<i>Leave this to me.</i>

243
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,428
Wait.

244
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:19,185
I chose her. You can't take her.

245
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,777
<i>I can't move.</i>

246
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,864
<i>I am so close to the surface,</i>

247
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,824
<i>and Shiori is going to die.</i>

248
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,499
Go! Hurry, take Shiori!

249
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:45,545
Ushio!

250
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,963
<i>Dummy!</i>

251
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:54,053
<i>Don't stop! Just go!</i>

252
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,899
<i>How am I ever going to return
this kind of favor?</i>

253
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:10,862
<i>Go,</i>

254
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,364
<i>me...</i>

255
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:20,997
Stop.

256
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,669
I told you to stop.

257
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,520
<i>Heh, You're a defect.</i>

258
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,958
I feel someone coming. You lucked out.

259
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:29,274
Shiori.

260
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,617
<i>Sis!</i>

261
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,119
Ushio!

262
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:52,005
I'm sorry, Ushio. I couldn't save Shiori.

263
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:57,302
I will kill the shadows with Shinpei.

264
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:01,014
I will save everyone
at the summer festival on the 24th.

265
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:07,729
Is that enough to pay you back for this?

266
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:12,191
Yes, of course that's enough.

267
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:21,034
She pretended to lose consciousness
and took Shiori's place.

268
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:22,368
Yes.

269
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,872
{\an8}I can't stand that monster.

270
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:26,789
Yes.

271
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:30,460
I want to kill it with my own hands.

272
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:33,004
Yes. We killed it already.

273
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:37,842
Hey! How can you be so calm?

274
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:38,760
But...

275
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:39,677
Huh?

276
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:42,138
I should have done it.

277
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:47,852
Shinpei. I'm sorry.

278
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:52,315
Who should do what now?

279
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,948
Found you.

280
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:04,869
Hey, Ushioh. Isn't this just an image?

281
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,663
You said they can't touch or talk to us.

282
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:10,875
What's this? It's not in my memory.

283
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:14,212
This is bad. End this, Ushioh!

284
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:17,840
It took me a long time
to find you after that.

285
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:24,680
I won't let you get away this time.

286
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:41,823
Are we back?

287
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,117
Shinpei, look at your arm.

288
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,034
Huh?

289
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:53,334
That's where it grabbed me.
