1
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:32,489
{\an8}What is your name?

2
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,116
{\an8}ORIGINAL

3
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,577
{\an8}Mioh Kofune.

4
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,040
When were you born? How?

5
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:46,003
Yesterday.
Mother scanned Mioh at the wake.

6
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:48,005
Later that night...

7
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,595
<i>I was born in the cave.</i>

8
00:01:56,013 --> 00:02:00,517
When you say "Mother,"
you mean Heine in Shiori's body?

9
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:02,311
<i>Yes.</i>

10
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,566
Did you cut the brakes in Mio's bicycle?

11
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:08,776
Yes.

12
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:11,111
To kill me?

13
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:18,160
Not necessarily. It was just more
convenient if you were in the hospital.

14
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:22,581
It's more convenient to kill Mio
in the hospital and take her place?

15
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:27,586
Yes, since Dr. Hishigata is
an ally of the shadows.

16
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,505
Was that Heine's order?

17
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:35,135
No, I just wanted to do that.
But I failed.

18
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,224
I didn't know that
she was making Mio's shadow.

19
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:46,939
Don't worry, Tokiko. Now I don't even know
why I wanted to kill her.

20
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:51,902
Heine created you to find Ushio's shadow.

21
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,362
She is a traitor, after all.

22
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:57,449
I can't copy people. Can you?

23
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:00,369
There are two types of copying.

24
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:07,668
Taking the form of the person we copy,
or giving birth to a new shadow.

25
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:09,378
Giving birth?

26
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:14,091
We children can give birth
to a new shadow only once.

27
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:15,551
"Children"?

28
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:18,137
<i>Heine can give birth
as many times as she wants,</i>

29
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,391
<i>but since she has become weak,
it's no longer easy for her.</i>

30
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:27,146
<i>Shadows at the grandchild level
cannot give birth.</i>

31
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,232
{\an8}<i>Shadows can transform multiple times.</i>

32
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,277
{\an8}<i>Regardless of which type of copy we are,</i>

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,199
{\an8}<i>we have one week to erase the original,
or we turn into mud and disappear.</i>

34
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:44,288
<i>I have six more days to live,
although I don't really care.</i>

35
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:46,999
That's all I know.

36
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:52,129
Sorry, Shinpei.
I don't have much useful information.

37
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:53,630
Ah, no...

38
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:56,925
Y-You don't need to apologize!

39
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,678
Hey, that's a shadow, Sou.

40
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:02,514
What? Ah, but...

41
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,184
-Sou?
-Sou?

42
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,146
Ah, darn it! This is confusing.

43
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,068
Heine needs to consume
a lot of people for her to be revived.

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,987
She's giving birth to
build an army for that.

45
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:22,826
Father and I tried to revive Heine
for Mother.

46
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,955
We thought she needed the meals
for that purpose...

47
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:31,919
<i>but they had a different objective.</i>

48
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,756
And the old man knew everything?

49
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:40,427
Unbelievable.
He doesn't care if we all die.

50
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:42,179
Father.

51
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:50,104
It's hard to take it in, but Dr. Hishigata
must know Heine's true objective.

52
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:54,316
I'm meeting him tonight at 10 p.m.

53
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:59,321
Okay, then we know what to do next.

54
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:01,240
<i>We're going to the Hishigata Clinic.</i>

55
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:06,662
It's so itchy!
There are so many mosquitoes here!

56
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:08,330
Protect Mio.

57
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,292
Is that an order?

58
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:17,381
I don't know if it's an order...
Uh, I guess it is.

59
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:23,262
Shinpei, are you afraid of me?
You're so far away.

60
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:26,723
I guess I'd be lying if I said no.

61
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:29,476
You killed me over and over, you know.

62
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,982
That was in another world.
I haven't killed anyone yet.

63
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:39,027
Can I ask you something too?

64
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,946
Ah... sure.

65
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,407
Did you have a girlfriend in Tokyo?

66
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,660
-A girl--
-Girlfriend?

67
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,413
W-What are you asking him?

68
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:54,126
He sometimes has a Tokyo accent.
It's totally suspicious. Is it not?

69
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,462
I don't have a girlfriend.

70
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,881
People just don't understand
the Wakayama dialect in Tokyo.

71
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:01,800
I try to blend in with the locals.

72
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:06,680
I see. Well, I was just joking.

73
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:11,685
Have you ever wondered why
I don't call you "Brother"?

74
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:22,529
Listen. I'll follow your order
and protect Mio.

75
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:28,452
But you're the only one
who can really protect Mio.

76
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:33,290
I-I don't know what she's talking about!

77
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,833
Let's just go, Shinpei!

78
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:35,918
Okay...

79
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:43,550
HISHIGATA CLINIC

80
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:52,184
It's open.

81
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:59,191
What's going on?
Everything in our house is gone.

82
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:06,114
Our rooms are empty too.
Desks, closets, beds, everything.

83
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:08,951
Ms. Nagumo?

84
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:10,244
Yes.

85
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:15,707
There are no human stains.
It seems that only things were erased.

86
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,461
Was there anything that
they didn't want us to see?

87
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:22,756
Although it seems like
they erased everything.

88
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:28,637
They had to hide something,
but didn't know where it was.

89
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,639
That's my impression.

90
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:35,727
This has to be my old man!
That's why he's not here.

91
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:39,940
Our mother is gone too.
What the hell is happening?

92
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,316
Shinpei!

93
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:46,238
You felt a shadow over here,
didn't you, Ushioh?

94
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:47,948
Yes.

95
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:53,579
Ow! Don't squeeze so hard!
It cuts off the blood flow. You scared?

96
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:59,126
O-Of course, I'm scared!
I hate hospitals at night...

97
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:02,045
I hear something.

98
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:12,014
It's not coming. What's that sound?

99
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:15,601
Is something stuck in the door
at the basement level?

100
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,520
Bullet holes.

101
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,939
It looks like there was a fight here.

102
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:25,527
Be careful. I sense shadows below us.

103
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:27,904
What's in the basement?

104
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:30,866
The morgue.

105
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,951
The morgue?

106
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:34,453
It's fine.

107
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:40,042
The only thing down there is
Ushio's body that Father didn't cremate.

108
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,962
Oh, right.
I guess it isn't scary if it's my body.

109
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:45,130
Is that really the issue?

110
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,132
Feeling fear shows that

111
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,760
your survival instincts
are functioning properly.

112
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:51,762
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

113
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:56,808
Shadows are scarier than ghosts.
Brace yourselves.

114
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,572
That's our mother's wheelchair.
Why is it here?

115
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:11,782
Behind you!

116
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,787
MORGUE

117
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,538
Did you see their face?

118
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:19,623
No.

119
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,185
T-There's nothing here.

120
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,243
Seriously? I had no idea
this place was under our house.

121
00:09:58,328 --> 00:09:59,705
It's gone.

122
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:01,957
Ushio's body was here?

123
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:07,754
Yes. Ushioh can recover
if she scans the original, right?

124
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:12,217
He must have decided it was best
not to leave it here until tomorrow.

125
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:18,098
Want to restart?

126
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:22,894
No, let's keep going.
We need to find Sou's parents.

127
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,355
Understood.

128
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:28,233
What's this passage, Tokiko?

129
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:31,069
It connects to Hiruko's grotto.

130
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,488
There was an entrance here.

131
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:37,576
We use it to bring meals to Heine.

132
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:41,538
It's a different route than
the old path from the old clinic.

133
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:48,044
I feel a subtle presence of a shadow.
The one from earlier must've gone in here.

134
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:54,843
It's close. It's right there.

135
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:12,944
Mother?

136
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:20,410
{\an8}What is happening?

137
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,998
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot her!

138
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:27,083
But your father will die!

139
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,547
Ushioh!

140
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:36,968
It's okay, Sou. I'll bring her back.

141
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:44,810
Father!

142
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:53,401
He's not breathing.

143
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:10,418
Let me!

144
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,717
Come on, don't die on me.

145
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:25,559
Don't go without explaining yourself.
Wake up, old man!

146
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,114
Sou?

147
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:44,786
Stop keeping secrets. We're family.

148
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:48,748
How is Chitose... your mother?

149
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:53,253
I cut her link with Heine.
She'll wake up soon.

150
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:57,173
I see. I never thought...

151
00:12:57,883 --> 00:13:00,468
you'd reach this point so soon.

152
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:07,601
So Heine must've thought that I'd talk.

153
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:13,315
No point in hiding anything.
We can just copy your data.

154
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:16,776
Tokiko, kill them.

155
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,694
Father!

156
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:18,778
Kill them!

157
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:24,159
If you kill them,
Heine will trust me again.

158
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,246
No, Father. You've got it all wrong.

159
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:32,709
They have no intention
of keeping their promises.

160
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:37,422
I'm so disappointed in you, Tokiko.

161
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:41,259
Step back, Sou. Your gun is too close.

162
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:51,311
Hishigata...

163
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:55,398
What...

164
00:13:58,944 --> 00:13:59,778
You...

165
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,073
Too bad.

166
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:07,327
Do you think they'll be okay?

167
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:14,542
They've got Ushioh and Ms. Nagumo,
plus your shadow.

168
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:19,422
That's my biggest worry.
I still can't trust that thing.

169
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:23,385
I'm surprised you let it copy you.

170
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:30,225
When a shadow copies you,
it sees your whole body and heart.

171
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:31,476
Yeah.

172
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:35,563
I wanted you to know all of me.

173
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:39,150
I can't believe you can say that
with a straight face!

174
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,280
I'm done keeping secrets.

175
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,201
Mioh.

176
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:52,831
Do you trust me a bit now?

177
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,333
Yeah, thanks.

178
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:57,460
Really?

179
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,672
You can copy me
if you don't believe my words.

180
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,382
Never.

181
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:07,554
I don't want to know what's in your heart.

182
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:09,889
Sou.

183
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:13,768
You shot Tokiko! How could you do that?

184
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:16,396
Kill me.

185
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,608
You old fool!
Playing with people's lives...

186
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:21,943
Kill me.

187
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,698
Aren't you a doctor?

188
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,327
How can a doctor say "kill"
so easily? Tell me!

189
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:38,543
So you won't say anything. Fine.

190
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,546
Mioh, do it.

191
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:54,517
I can't copy him. He has immunity.

192
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:57,937
I see. Then he'll need to talk.

193
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:58,855
Wait.

194
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:03,943
That can't be! You can't copy me?

195
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:08,615
You already had a shadow, but it died.

196
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,620
People like you have immunity,
and you can't be copied again.

197
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:21,503
It can't be... My shadow can't be created?

198
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,588
That's what I'm saying.

199
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,469
Doctor...

200
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:34,933
Chitose, then what did I do
everything for?

201
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:40,063
Negoro.

202
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:47,445
Doctor, I will be leaving now.

203
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:50,782
I got what I came for.

204
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,120
She's beyond my range.

205
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:57,872
Doctor, I have a message from Shide.

206
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:02,210
"We appreciate the Hishigata family
for the support you provided."

207
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:06,464
"However, it is now over. Take care."

208
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:10,510
I also have a message for Shinpei Ajiro.

209
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:16,224
"It seems you didn't die.
I am fed up with your stubbornness."

210
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,601
"There's nothing you can do."

211
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:22,313
"Everything will end in two days."

212
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,023
Stop! Darn you!

213
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:25,233
Don't go!

214
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:30,488
Don't go after it.

215
00:17:30,572 --> 00:17:31,531
But!

216
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:35,785
It's using Ushio's body as bait
to lure us in.

217
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:40,540
It brought up the time limit
to provoke us.

218
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:42,500
If we take the bait, we're done.

219
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:48,798
But I can't just let it go, Shinpei.
That was the shadow we saw in the hall.

220
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,429
Calm down, Sis.
Shinpei feels the worst about this.

221
00:17:56,848 --> 00:18:02,604
You can't just let your emotions
drive your actions.

222
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:08,443
Step back from yourself and turn
your anger and regret into weapons.

223
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:11,237
Shinpei.

224
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,326
Dr. Hishigata, does it mean anything
for you to keep quiet any longer?

225
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:22,999
Get my daughter. Bring me the real Tokiko.

226
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:34,010
Are you awake?

227
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,888
Ah... Sei.

228
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,599
W-Where am I?

229
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:47,315
I gave Chitose
the same memories I showed you.

230
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,737
I'm sorry, Chitose.

231
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:57,700
<i>Sou's mother did not realize
that she was a shadow herself.</i>

232
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:01,454
<i>She was created that way.</i>

233
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:08,962
You are trying to stop the ceremony,
but should you really kill Heine?

234
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,464
What do you mean?

235
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:15,301
All the shadows will die with Heine.

236
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:19,973
That means your Ushioh will die too!

237
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:26,729
Ushioh.

238
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:31,567
It's fine! I died two days ago anyway.

239
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:37,365
I'm just lucky to have
this bonus time being alive.

240
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:41,369
I want to use the time
to help save everyone.

241
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:45,456
Defeating Heine will solve
everything, right?

242
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,211
That's good news!
In that case, I'll happily defeat Heine!

243
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:55,925
<i>She's right. I'm embarrassed
that I even hesitated.</i>

244
00:19:56,718 --> 00:19:57,552
Right?

245
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:58,720
Yeah.

246
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:04,434
Dr. Hishigata, what is Heine planning
after being revived?

247
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:09,439
She just wants to go back.

248
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:15,987
<i>Back to where she came from,
in the deep and dark ocean.</i>

249
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:24,454
<i>No being from this world can reach
that place, unless it's a shadow.</i>

250
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:31,919
<i>Heine wants to just take shadows.
Just the family that she chose.</i>

251
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,047
But that's...

252
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,633
It is possible if she regains her power.

253
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:41,095
<i>It is a land without time.</i>

254
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:46,100
<i>Chitose and I were going to
become shadows and live forever.</i>

255
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:51,689
{\an8}Sou and Tokiko were also
supposed to become shadows.

256
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:55,902
{\an8}That's why you thought
it was okay if you killed us?

257
00:20:57,278 --> 00:21:00,990
Are you a fool? That's the reason?

258
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:06,829
{\an8}You're so self-centered and hopeless.

259
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:13,252
Thank you for saving me.

260
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,423
Chitose...

261
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:22,387
{\an8}But we need to finish this. Sou, Tokiko...

262
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,308
I am so glad to have
seen you grow until now.

263
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:33,606
No, Chitose.
I have no reason to live if you die.

264
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:37,193
{\an8}No, you have our children.

265
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:41,823
{\an8}You have the people of this island
who need you.

266
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:46,285
{\an8}Like Shinpei said, this isn't over.

267
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:49,330
{\an8}You can still make up for your mistakes.

268
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:05,805
What is this?

269
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:12,937
This is the clinic's secret records
that Tokiko hid for me.

270
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:20,111
<i>Diagnosed with Capgras syndrome,
or the local disease of shadow sickness,</i>

271
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:24,949
the people on this list are actually
those whom Heine has consumed.

272
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,329
Your parents' names are
on the list, Shinpei.

273
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:36,878
But my parents' boat accidentally sank
when they were working.

274
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:42,341
They found Hiruko's grotto and
planned to make it public.

275
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:46,554
That's why they were killed, and the thing
made to look like an accident.

276
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:52,143
Shide killed them,
and I switched the bodies to feed Heine.

277
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:54,353
I'm sorry.

278
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:57,023
What? Is that all you have to say?

279
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:59,692
You know the true identity of Shide,
don't you?

280
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:04,113
Yes. Look at this photograph.

281
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:09,744
Shide is Heine's protector
and the first child she bore.

282
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,956
The original's name was
Shidehiko Hishigata...

283
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:22,089
{\an8}the founder of the Hishigata Clinic
and its first director.

284
