1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:04,527
Ah! Are you making curry? Shinpei's curry?

2
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:09,240
Ushioh?

3
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:14,161
Again? Quit looking like you saw a ghost.

4
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,373
You're only supposed to
appear on the 24th!

5
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:19,834
What? Why do you know that?

6
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,043
What?

7
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:25,005
Listen, Shinpei.
You might not believe this,

8
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,716
but something terrible happens
on the 24th.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,555
Everyone gets swallowed up by
some black shadow monster and disappears.

10
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:35,182
Wait… You…

11
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:39,103
Did you come from that festival too?

12
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:42,606
What? Did you too?

13
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,819
I washed my eyes
so I feel a bit better now.

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,072
Wh-What?

15
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:52,449
That smell! Are you making curry?

16
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:53,993
Y-Yes.

17
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:57,288
Ah, I should've thought of that.

18
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:02,751
Shinpei! Your stomach growled
so loud! Just like Sis.

19
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:08,424
Thank goodness.
That means you're feeling better.

20
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:09,758
I guess so…

21
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:14,930
<i>Calm down, and focus on making the curry.</i>

22
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:19,393
<i>This situation is not good.</i>

23
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:26,525
<i>Ms. Nagumo… this isn't just
a small difference.</i>

24
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:33,282
Ah, sorry Shinpei, it took so long
for me to come back.

25
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:36,285
That Mr. Karikiri sure can talk.

26
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:38,954
Welcome back. It's almost done.

27
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:40,539
-Mio.
-Yes?

28
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,125
Why aren't you helping?

29
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,669
My job is eating!

30
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:50,841
Smells great. Ushio used to love that.

31
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:55,095
<i>In five minutes, Alain goes to
the washroom, Mio goes to the bathroom.</i>

32
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,765
<i>Go to my room. Don't be seen.</i>

33
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,227
-Got it!
-<i>Does she even understand this situation?</i>

34
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,479
{\an8}FAKE CALL TO TOTSUMURA
TELL SOU I'LL CALL HIM TOMORROW

35
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:05,439
{\an8}All done!

36
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:07,066
Hey, where are you going?

37
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:10,152
Well… I'm going to eat in my room.

38
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:11,946
Two plates?

39
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:16,200
W-Well, I'm super hungry.

40
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,924
Curry!

41
00:03:56,008 --> 00:04:00,679
-<i>This is… the curry chant!</i>
-Curry, hm-hm-hm!

42
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:04,141
-Shinpei's curry!
-<i>Damn it. Why is this happening?</i>

43
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:07,436
Don't let the words and the appearance
of shadows affect you.

44
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:10,606
Wow!

45
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,525
Can I eat?

46
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:14,443
Sure.

47
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:17,279
Yay! Thank you for this meal!

48
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:22,951
<i>Somehow, this shadow Ushio
looped back with me.</i>

49
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:25,329
-Yum!
-<i>That has to be it.</i>

50
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,791
How did you get here?

51
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:31,210
What? I walked.

52
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:37,341
I woke up on Omotohama Beach.
Don't worry. No one saw me.

53
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,718
It's a monster!

54
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,554
I'm like a monster.

55
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:45,599
I'll make sure no one sees me again.

56
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:48,352
Monster? No…

57
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:50,938
That's not true.

58
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:59,363
Oh! What was that? It tickled!
Did you do something?

59
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,907
Ah… no. Sorry.

60
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,493
Ugh, I got goosebumps.

61
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:08,956
<i>I can kill it. Just stab its shadow.</i>

62
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:13,377
Mmm, it's so good!

63
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,839
<i>Look, it's not even a bit on guard.</i>

64
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:23,095
<i>But it did save me that time.</i>

65
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,806
Yummy!

66
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,057
<i>It…</i>

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,019
Tokyo?

68
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:33,605
Alain's friend is in Tokyo.

69
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,733
I'm going to stay there
and go to culinary school.

70
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,902
I won't go to a high school in Wakayama.

71
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:40,112
What?

72
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:41,530
I made up my mind.

73
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,615
You never told me.

74
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,201
It's not like I need to tell you.

75
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:49,538
How can you make such
an important decision by yourself?

76
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,124
Why can't I decide for myself?

77
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:55,586
I'm not a Kofune.

78
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,922
I need to start earning my own living.

79
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:02,801
I hate constantly being a burden
on you and Alain!

80
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:04,303
A burden?

81
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,222
Do you hate it here?

82
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,057
What? Why are you asking that?

83
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,684
<i>No, Ushio.</i>

84
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,147
-Enough! I didn't even need to tell you!
-<i>I…</i>

85
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,107
-I'm the one who's had enough!
-<i>love you.</i>

86
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:28,368
<i>I don't want us to become
family like this.</i>

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,334
Hey, Shinpei. Today's your last day.

88
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,794
I want your curry for dinner.

89
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:41,215
{\an8}What? I need to pack.

90
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,008
I'll make it for you next time.

91
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:47,429
You dummy.

92
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,604
<i>There was no next time.
At one point, that's what I thought.</i>

93
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,776
You finally made it for me. I'm glad.

94
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,695
I got to eat your curry again.

95
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:05,948
I'm glad I'm alive.

96
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:10,786
Is it good?

97
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:12,496
I want seconds!

98
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,208
It's not as good when Dad makes it.

99
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,919
I really like yours the best.

100
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:23,131
<i>This is Ushio. She's Ushio.</i>

101
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:26,843
I see. I'm glad.

102
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:32,641
<i>Hey, Shinpei. Will the same thing
happen on the 24th?</i>

103
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:35,852
<i>Yes. I'm trying to stop that.</i>

104
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:37,521
I'll help too.

105
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:42,776
I can't stand that monster ruining
Hitogashima Island's summer festival.

106
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:46,154
And I definitely can't let
Mio and the others disappear!

107
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:49,533
Right. Me too. Let's stop it, together!

108
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:50,450
Okay!

109
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,161
Can you copy humans?

110
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:55,122
Ah! Let's see…

111
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:58,375
I guess not.

112
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:05,549
It is currently 8:45 p.m.
Shadow Mio should appear in 10 minutes.

113
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:08,093
<i>How does your location look, Nezu?</i>

114
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:11,847
No issues. Just a little breeze.

115
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:16,685
There's enough light in town.
Any contact from Shinpei?

116
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:17,728
<i>None.</i>

117
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:21,440
<i>Don't rely on his foresight
too much, Ryunosuke.</i>

118
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:26,111
Prey never moves the way we expect it to.

119
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:30,407
Hunters always need to adapt.

120
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:31,867
Roger that.

121
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:35,245
ANY ISSUES?

122
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:40,250
<i>It's from Ms. Nagumo.
Should I mention Ushioh, or lie to her?</i>

123
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:41,710
But…

124
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:43,920
-Shinpei?
-Oh, yeah.

125
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,007
Why are you still dressed like that?

126
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,426
It's weird to wear a swimsuit
in the house.

127
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,679
Huh? Oh yeah. Why…

128
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:56,266
Why didn't it bother me until now?

129
00:08:58,185 --> 00:08:59,311
Hey!

130
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,773
What did you do?

131
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:04,274
It wasn't me!

132
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:08,362
My swimsuit disappeared! Why?

133
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,197
Is it because you copied the swimsuit?

134
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,658
Whatever! Just give me something to wear!

135
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:21,750
What? Mio's shadow is coming?
Did you lock up?

136
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,293
We're fine.

137
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,173
Although, locking up
probably won't help much.

138
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:32,636
It only takes a tiny gap
for a shadow to slip through.

139
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,305
Really? Let me try!

140
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,021
Don't worry. It hasn't come in here.

141
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,690
Not once.

142
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:47,651
Shinpei?

143
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,319
It's Mio! Hide!

144
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,741
Are you finished eating?

145
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:58,203
I wanna wash the dishes.

146
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:00,497
Ah, the dishes. Sure.

147
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,793
You all done? What? You used two spoons?

148
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:06,753
Two glasses too.

149
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:11,466
Is that so strange? Nope, not at all!

150
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,928
Why sound formal all of a sudden?
Sis isn't here, is she?

151
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,392
You made this bowl for her, didn't you?

152
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,478
I'm sure she's here.

153
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:30,026
<i>On Hitogashima Island,
souls return home as guardian spirits.</i>

154
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,237
Mr. Karikiri always said that.

155
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,201
Ah… You can leave the bowls.
I'll wash them later.

156
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:41,455
Okay. Thanks for the meal, Shinpei.

157
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,710
Yikes. That was a close one.

158
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,087
Mio does have good instincts.

159
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:51,047
Ah! Whoa!

160
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:54,009
What is it? Forgot something?

161
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:56,428
<i>What the…</i>

162
00:10:58,305 --> 00:10:59,181
<i>It's not…</i>

163
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:07,898
Ushioh!

164
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,067
That hurt!

165
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:41,264
<i>I can't beat it in a fight.</i>

166
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:47,312
<i>But if I'm going to die anyway,
I'll try everything I can do!</i>

167
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:54,486
Come on then, Mioh. I'll take you on!

168
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,405
Sh-Shinpei.

169
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,661
Sis, why are you on his side?

170
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,914
He's with Nezu and Minakata,
who kill shadows.

171
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:09,376
So the fake doesn't have
the same instincts.

172
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:14,965
I love Shinpei. What's wrong with
helping someone I love?

173
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,055
But you died.

174
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,266
Sis died.

175
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,726
You died!

176
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:31,022
Shin…

177
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,821
What did I tell you?

178
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:47,789
It hurts…

179
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:51,960
Why? Shinpei…

180
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:56,006
Shinpei… I too…

181
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,729
Ushioh. Hey, stay with me, Ushioh!

182
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:12,063
Coming in.

183
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:17,903
Ms. Nagumo…

184
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,575
Why get in my way?

185
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,953
I am glad you are safe, Shinpei.

186
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:30,165
But look at that. It's a shadow.

187
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,959
I'm going to kill it. Get out of my way.

188
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,420
I-I won't!

189
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,923
Did that shadow get into your head?

190
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,384
I told you they can trick you
if you keep talking to them.

191
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:48,099
I know you begrudge shadows
and want to kill them all.

192
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:54,064
But this one protected me twice,
sacrificing itself.

193
00:13:54,147 --> 00:14:01,029
It doesn't think before it acts.
It's Ushio!

194
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:06,576
So, please heal its injury…

195
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,956
like you healed my arm!

196
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,170
Unbelievable.

197
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:21,758
Letting it go is one thing,
but actually healing it?

198
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,928
If you side with shadows,
I'll kill you too.

199
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:25,887
Fine.

200
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:29,849
I'll just loop back
and persuade you next time.

201
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,019
Shinpei.

202
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:39,609
Where's Mio? Is the real Mio okay?

203
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:42,487
Oh… She's…

204
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,947
The real one is in the bath.

205
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,282
I checked.

206
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:47,659
Really?

207
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:50,870
I see. Great.

208
00:14:51,454 --> 00:14:53,331
<i>It's the same voice.</i>

209
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,417
<i>Nagu… Can… hear…</i>

210
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,336
<i>The voice that brought me to this island.</i>

211
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,007
Adapt? Fine.

212
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,550
Show me your injury.

213
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:07,971
<i>Ushio Kofune sent me that message.</i>

214
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:17,188
No way! Wait! My arm disappeared!

215
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:18,273
U-Ushioh?

216
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:19,899
Huh? It doesn't hurt.

217
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:23,486
That injury is a projection of the damage
felt by the actual shadow.

218
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:26,614
A normal method won't heal it.
So be careful of…

219
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:29,242
It's cool, if it doesn't hurt.

220
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,286
You got over that too quick.

221
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:33,830
You are so big now.

222
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:37,542
I am Hizuru Minakata.
You probably don't remember me.

223
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:40,420
<i>I used to come to Bistro Kofune a lot.</i>

224
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:44,049
Really? Sorry. I don't remember that.

225
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,342
Listen to this.

226
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:49,387
<i>Summer festival…</i>

227
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,556
<i>…everybody was killed by shadows…</i>

228
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:55,769
<i>Only Shinpei Ajiro… can stop…</i>

229
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,316
<i>Please help. Please.</i>

230
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,443
Do you recall this message?

231
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:07,155
What is that? It's my voice.

232
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:13,578
This is the reason I came here.
So you don't remember?

233
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:14,829
No.

234
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:18,666
I see. Fine, forget it.

235
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,293
There's a bigger problem.

236
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:24,506
Why did the shadow Mio go
inside the Kofune home?

237
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,842
The shadow Mio knew
that Shiori was defeated.

238
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:30,470
Apparently, they are sharing information.

239
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:34,474
Mioh was aware of us
and decided to eliminate us.

240
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:37,435
It was after Nezu and me before…

241
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,647
but now it knew that
Shinpei Ajiro was also with us.

242
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:44,943
So Mioh entered your house
to kill Shinpei Ajiro.

243
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:48,363
Is it because I went with you
to Koba Mart?

244
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:49,864
But how did it find out?

245
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:53,618
<i>We destroyed all of the shadows
that were there.</i>

246
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:58,289
In any case, I can't act with you anymore.

247
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:00,959
As long as you stay with Ushio's shadow.

248
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,757
Ushioh may have saved you
and doesn't seem a threat to us.

249
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:13,930
<i>However, if Ushioh is broken,
we don't know when she might get fixed.</i>

250
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:18,560
That is the most we can do.

251
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,025
Ms. Nagumo!

252
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,615
At three o'clock tomorrow,
Mio's shadow killed you in Shinju Forest.

253
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:35,952
We killed Mioh, but there may be others.

254
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,999
Please don't die!

255
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,880
Destiny can be changed.
This is a rare opportunity to prove that.

256
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,969
{\an8}BISTRO KOFUNE

259
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:09,611
Shinpei.

260
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,614
Good morning.

261
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:14,199
Oh… you were awake.

262
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:17,493
I'm hungry. And thirsty.

263
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,245
I'll bring you something.

264
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:20,830
Thanks!

265
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,291
Oh, yeah.

266
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:31,132
Yeah. Thanks, Tokiko. I feel better.

267
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:37,180
No, I'm sorry I kept you up. Bye.

268
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,852
Good morning, Shinpei.

269
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:47,815
I'm up already, so you don't have to
come wake me, okay?

270
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,525
Uh… okay.

271
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,487
<i>She can't come wake me if I'm already up.</i>

272
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,197
Wait, Shinpei!

273
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,160
Mio gave you this?

274
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:01,371
Yes. This is the original.

275
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,081
Original.

276
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:08,086
Does it make you remember anything?
Like before you died?

277
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,799
<i>Will you think about it?</i>

278
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:14,425
{\an8}<i>Where are you going?</i>

279
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,053
<i>We're opening the restaurant today.</i>

280
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,722
<i>I see. That sounds like Dad.</i>

281
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:26,145
<i>Yes, a restaurant is always there.
It has to stay the same.</i>

282
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:27,730
<i>Alain always said that.</i>

283
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:31,818
<i>I need to protect
this simple everyday life.</i>

284
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:38,116
Hi Shinpei. Sorry, was I too early?

285
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:42,203
Sorry for the wait.

286
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,788
-Hey.
-Here.

287
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:46,249
An umbrella? It's super sunny today.

288
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:47,250
Just take it.

289
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,212
What's with you? Such a weirdo.

290
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:00,305
I'll get straight to the point.

291
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:04,767
I need to tell you something
about Ushio's death.

292
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:06,769
Okay.

293
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:10,690
Ligature marks, right?
Someone may have killed me.

294
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:14,235
Right. Actually… Who are you?

295
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,738
Ushioh, you don't need
the disguise anymore.

296
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:19,282
Huh? Ushio?

297
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:22,452
Ah… No… It can't be…

298
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,413
Ushio!

299
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:26,331
Yo.

300
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:29,834
He's frozen.

301
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,254
<i>We told Sou everything.</i>

302
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:38,051
<i>Sou quietly listened to everything
we said.</i>

303
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:46,059
Sorry. If only I had done more
to save her. If only…

304
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:51,022
I know being sorry won't bring her back!
But please…

305
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:54,275
Hit me! If not, I…

306
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:56,652
What a kick!

307
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,614
Stand up, Sou. Feel better?

308
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:04,577
We are relying on you here. Quit whining!

309
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,751
The private beach behind
the elementary school.

310
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:16,047
So I died here.

311
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:18,800
She really doesn't remember.

312
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:19,926
No.

313
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:22,387
Ah, that's my phone.

314
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,515
I want to see inside, but it's locked.

315
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:29,185
What? The password changed.

316
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:30,686
It opened.

317
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,647
By fingerprint.

318
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,359
Open your email, memos, photos…
Anything could help.

319
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:40,029
What? Friday was the 20th, right?

320
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:44,367
There's a video file from the morning
of the day before I died.

321
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,284
That's it!

322
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:48,413
Hold on. I'll play it.

323
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
