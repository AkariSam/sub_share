1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,114
{\an8}JULY 23, AFTER 4:00 P.M.

2
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:10,074
You'll catch a cold.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,499
The body is in the morgue.
Did you contact her parents?

4
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:19,416
Not yet.

5
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:26,006
Since a famous author was killed,
the press will flood this island.

6
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,093
I cannot hide the stab wound on her chest.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,974
You don't need to.
This is murder, and I know who did it.

8
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:39,895
But... Just give me one more day.

9
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,523
-Okay. Fine.
-Thank you.

10
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:48,279
Sorry, you were saying?
It's hard to talk with this.

11
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:53,617
It's what you said
about there being two Shides.

12
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:58,497
He has lived for over 300 years
by transferring bodies.

13
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:02,251
I won't be surprised
if he had spares for emergencies.

14
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:06,130
So, Heine gave birth to multiple Shides?

15
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:07,423
<i>No.</i>

16
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:13,304
Shide preserved his past bodies,
but they all burned during the war.

17
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:15,598
My father once told me that.

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,891
Iwao.

19
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:19,935
<i>The body in the photo still exists?</i>

20
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:26,525
Iwao Karikiri died 40 years ago,
after the war.

21
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:30,821
It's a mystery how he preserves
or mobilizes the body.

22
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:32,281
A second account?

23
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:34,617
Cover your ears.

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,534
What?

25
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:42,124
It struck the ocean.

26
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,127
You... How did you know that?

27
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,225
That's what you think now, Sou.

28
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:27,855
{\an8}It would've taken forever to find shadows
if we were together.

29
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:31,191
{\an8}Then maybe we might not have saved
those three kids.

30
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:37,281
Hizuru died to save you and Mio.
It was Shinpei's choice.

31
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,618
He said it was his responsibility alone.

32
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:46,874
He always tries to carry all the weight.

33
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,960
It's not just his fault!

34
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,047
I just want...

35
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,593
to help him.

36
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:05,392
<i>We've lost Ushioh, Ms. Nagumo, and Rose.</i>

37
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,563
<i>We no longer have Nezu's rifle,
Ushioh's shotgun copy,</i>

38
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:12,900
<i>and Totsumura's gun.</i>

39
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:16,320
But Shide is still alive. What now?

40
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:18,655
Do we have a chance to win this?

41
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:19,865
About that.

42
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,286
What is in your pocket?

43
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,330
Oh, this?

44
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:32,711
It won't respond to me.
It's probably a fragment of Ushioh.

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,801
I knew it.

46
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:42,304
<i>This is why Heine escaped.</i>

47
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:43,263
What?

48
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:48,143
<i>It responds, Shinpei.
We shadows can sense it.</i>

49
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:50,646
<i>Sis was super mad.</i>

50
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,022
When?

51
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,983
When Shide threw a knife at you.

52
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,111
Sis is in here.

53
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:01,407
All her memories are here.

54
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,869
She transferred her memories
to this before disappearing.

55
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,331
But she has no body.
This can't move around.

56
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:14,044
That's why Heine thought
that Ushioh was still alive.

57
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:17,631
She's now just memories,
yet she protected you.

58
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,883
Can you scan these memories?

59
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:23,554
No, its memories are made
so that no one can read them,

60
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,722
just like Mother's.

61
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:29,768
Maybe it's because she didn't want
the enemy to access it.

62
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,938
So only Sis can read that data.

63
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,986
But Sis is already...

64
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,625
She'll be back.

65
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:55,919
What?

66
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:57,379
That's right!

67
00:05:57,963 --> 00:06:01,049
Tomorrow, during the fireworks,
at that beach!

68
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:05,846
<i>Ushioh before she knew anything
will appear again!</i>

69
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:11,894
I see.

70
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,898
We can get her to
scan this shell tomorrow.

71
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:19,860
Yes, it'll work. That's why she left this.

72
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:21,820
Ushioh...

73
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,158
will be reborn!

74
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:30,746
Ushio...

75
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,085
{\an8}We had been pseudo-looping
with your memories,

76
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:42,549
which means Mio saw that scene.

77
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:45,802
Sou.

78
00:06:45,886 --> 00:06:47,513
Whoa, M-Mio!

79
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,139
Do you know where Shinpei is?

80
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:50,807
Uh, no...

81
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:52,768
-Okay.
-Wait!

82
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,728
What?

83
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:58,023
I...

84
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:01,860
-I'm still in love with--
-I'm shadow Mio.

85
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:07,282
You really won't give up.
You already know my answer.

86
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:10,744
So, it won't change?

87
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:12,913
It won't.

88
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:15,499
I see.

89
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:19,795
You like Shinpei, don't you?

90
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:22,256
Ah! W-Why do you say that?

91
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:24,925
It's obvious. You're not the shadow.

92
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:29,555
You'll stick to your answer?

93
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,019
Are we still friends?

94
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,314
Yes.

95
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:41,024
And that won't change?

96
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:43,986
Yes.

97
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,780
I see. Good.

98
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:50,659
Shinpei said he was going to the roof.

99
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,038
Shinpei.

100
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:57,249
Yeah?

101
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,625
What are you doing?

102
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,085
Practicing.

103
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,339
Do you remember what I said
when you left this morning?

104
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:07,217
You wanted to tell me something.

105
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:10,721
Will Sis really come back tomorrow?

106
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:14,433
Ushioh must've put her data
in the shell for a reason.

107
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,146
She may have scanned Shide
before she disappeared.

108
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:22,858
Looks like you've come up
with another good strategy.

109
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:27,654
We'll see. I'll tell everyone later.
Is this what you wanted to talk about?

110
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:31,283
Uh, yeah, well...

111
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,791
I like you.

112
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,837
R-Really.

113
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,674
I'm in love you, Shinpei.

114
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:49,926
Oh...

115
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:52,095
Okay.

116
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:54,473
That's it?

117
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:57,559
No. Thanks.

118
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,520
Did you know?

119
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:03,148
Yeah.

120
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:09,404
Don't be weird about it, okay?
I just wanted to get it out there.

121
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:13,200
We might die tomorrow,

122
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:17,788
and I didn't want to go
without telling you how I felt.

123
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,750
I wanted to get it off my chest.

124
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,543
I see.

125
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:27,422
Yeah.

126
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,803
Sorry, Mio.

127
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,811
I don't feel the same. I love Ushio.

128
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:43,605
Yeah.

129
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:47,025
You're my precious little sister.

130
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:53,323
Yeah. Thanks for being honest.

131
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:57,661
Ah! I feel so relieved!

132
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:03,458
Now I can die without any regrets!

133
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:12,426
Let it all out, Mio. You were brave.

134
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:15,137
I'm so proud of you.

135
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,639
Tokiko...

136
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,099
It's okay.

137
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:24,146
Sis might come back tomorrow,
but she's still a shadow.

138
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:29,526
She'll disappear once we beat Heine.
Can't he get with you then?

139
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,069
I can't hope for that!

140
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,780
Shinpei doesn't easily
change his mind like that!

141
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:37,492
Time to focus! Tomorrow is the big day!

142
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:43,915
No matter what happens,
tomorrow, July 24, is the last day.

143
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,042
CAUTION: GASOLINE SPILLAGE

144
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:56,928
<i>Shide said that I had the power
to observe parallel worlds.</i>

145
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,638
Parallel worlds?

146
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:02,517
If a time traveler goes back
and changes the future,

147
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:08,356
the timeline splits and creates
a world parallel to the original one.

148
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,402
{\an8}So there's a world where Mio and I die,
and another where we live.

149
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:13,320
{\an8}Yes.

150
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:19,242
So when Shinpei dies, the world is copied,

151
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:23,538
and only his consciousness moves
to one of them.

152
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:28,210
Then the past world will be gone.

153
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:33,673
I get that, but what about Ushioh?
How do you know she will appear?

154
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:34,800
Right.

155
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:42,265
I met Ushioh in the third loop
and she came with me.

156
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:48,480
She came to the fourth-loop world
with both consciousness and body.

157
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:54,027
I see. The fourth-loop world
had its own Ushioh,

158
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,488
<i>which means two Ushiohs existed
at this point.</i>

159
00:11:56,571 --> 00:11:57,948
Exactly.

160
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,617
Right now at this time,

161
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,453
<i>Ushioh is floating in the sea.</i>

162
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:06,623
<i>She's recovering from the damage
from trying to save Shiori.</i>

163
00:12:07,374 --> 00:12:10,627
<i>If she were like Heine or me,</i>

164
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,714
<i>her consciousness would transfer
to her body in the sea during a loop.</i>

165
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:19,845
<i>So two Ushiohs exist right now:
the ninth-loop Ushioh in the sea,</i>

166
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:23,557
and the third-loop Ushioh
who traveled with me.

167
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:26,852
Shide and Heine must be aware of this.

168
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:32,315
Ushioh read this in Shide's mind,
so she thought of a way to revive herself.

169
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:37,571
That's why she left her memories,
hoping we would figure this out.

170
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:42,450
Stop, these are just theories.
Just wishful thinking.

171
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:48,832
This is the first 24th since we started
looping with Ushioh. It's possible.

172
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,878
I think Ushioh knew.

173
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,088
How can you be sure?

174
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:59,217
It was wishful thinking before,
but now I'm certain.

175
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:01,928
Watch.

176
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:08,226
It's moving.

177
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,730
It's slight, but no matter where I put it,
it tries to move south.

178
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:13,440
Since when...

179
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:17,944
It moved the most at three this morning,
but it's weaker now.

180
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,988
Oh? The tides!

181
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:25,952
{\an8}<i>Ushioh must be in the Kii Channel,
neither in Osaka Bay nor in Setonaikai.</i>

182
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:29,623
Yes. This shell is reacting to Ushioh.

183
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,917
That means she was close by earlier.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,128
Low tide and high tide occur twice a day.

185
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:38,340
The second high tide is
around six in the evening.

186
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:42,302
<i>Then Ushioh will drift closer
to this island again.</i>

187
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:48,266
One is already a threat to Shide,
yet there may be two Ushiohs.

188
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,563
He won't risk that.
Shide will come at full force.

189
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:57,442
But they don't know
Ushioh's exact location.

190
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:01,905
Heine said that Ushioh was defective,
and she couldn't sense her.

191
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:06,117
We know where she is.
That is our key to victory.

192
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,581
<i>If we miss this chance,
we'll lose Ushioh forever.</i>

193
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,124
Let's go get her.

194
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,042
Yes.

195
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,252
I see a glimmer of hope now.

196
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:22,133
Okay, everyone. Let's get moving.
We can do this.

197
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:23,927
{\an8}JULY 24

198
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,639
{\an8}<i>This </i>mikoshi<i> shrine will be carried
to Omotohama Beach.</i>

199
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:30,809
<i>Load all the collected garbage on it.</i>

200
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:37,899
It may be garbage but it's still divine,
so it will be brought back here.

201
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:42,362
<i>You can walk along this </i>mikoshi<i>,
then enjoy the Omiokuri.</i>

202
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:46,449
Hiruko will bring you good health.

203
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:49,703
At night, we can enjoy the fireworks.

204
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:53,498
Longevity to all of us, you and me!

205
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,794
It's quiet.

206
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:03,383
Yes. It's been quiet.
Shinpei's strategy must be working.

207
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:04,467
Yeah.

208
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,805
I didn't think we'd talk again, Ryunosuke.

209
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:12,809
Sis was grateful to you.

210
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:14,019
What?

211
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:17,480
<i>You saved her 14 years ago.</i>

212
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:22,402
Hizuru wrote to me sometimes.

213
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:27,323
I was shocked when she said
her novel became a movie.

214
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:30,493
I didn't even know she was an author.

215
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:33,329
You were really the only person
who knew that.

216
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,582
What's with her? Was she shy?

217
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:41,087
You're the only adult who believed
her story about shadows.

218
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:44,049
Because of that,
people thought I was crazy.

219
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:46,968
I guess I'm used to that, though.

220
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:52,682
We trust you, Mr. Nezu. Both Sis and me.

221
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:57,395
You don't need to say that.

222
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:00,315
It's time.

223
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,069
A festival without Ushio seems so somber.

224
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:07,238
She was always leading the <i>mikoshi</i>.

225
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:10,033
I'll carry it for the both of us.

226
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:13,161
Stay until the end this year, Alain.

227
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:18,333
You know I'd love to,
but I have to prep for tomorrow.

228
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,459
Tomorrow?

229
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,419
What is it?

230
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,216
Nothing. I hadn't planned for tomorrow.

231
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:33,598
In the search of the Kii Channel,
are any strays ignoring my signal?

232
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:35,433
Why do you ask?

233
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:39,562
Two hours have passed
since I lost Shinpei's location.

234
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:41,272
What do you think this means, Shide?

235
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,483
Did he erase the mark?

236
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:49,948
No. It can't be erased.
I burned it onto his very presence.

237
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:55,662
However, he can block his presence,
just like you in the mud.

238
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:59,374
I gave him too many ideas.

239
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,338
<i>Most strays were sent to find Ushioh.
If Hiruko's grotto is invaded now...</i>

240
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,799
That won't happen yet.

241
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:11,928
<i>They came to my burrow once,
and nearly got destroyed.</i>

242
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:17,600
<i>They won't attempt it again,
unless they are certain.</i>

243
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:20,812
Then why hide?

244
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,067
Here is my theory.
It's the Ushioh he has with him.

245
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:30,029
It can sense Ushioh's location
in the Kii Channel.

246
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:33,032
He is hiding his own location,

247
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:38,037
so that he can get to Ushioh
without revealing her position.

248
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,789
I would do that if I were him.

249
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:46,296
<i>Find Ushioh before they do
and get rid of her.</i>

250
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:53,344
<i>Be fruitful.</i>

251
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:56,306
Oh, god of harvests.

252
00:17:57,265 --> 00:18:01,603
<i>In the open fields of
Kyushu, Miyasaki, Tachibana,</i>

253
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:06,816
the purification shall occur.

254
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,818
<i>Oh, god of harvest.</i>

255
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,446
-Heave ho!
-Heave ho!

256
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:16,451
<i>Cast away the disaster,
famine, and destruction.</i>

257
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:20,872
{\an8}-<i>Cast away, purify, light the way...</i>
-Step back!

258
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:26,044
<i>Shide, you hide leaves in a forest.</i>

259
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:31,674
<i>Shinpei will come, hidden among strays.</i>

260
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:35,345
<i>I told the strays to go near you.</i>

261
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:39,849
<i>Look around.
Find a stray separated from the flock.</i>

262
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:42,393
Found you.

263
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:45,104
<i>One stray is drifting away into the sea.</i>

264
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:52,445
She's really close.
I'm getting stronger responses.

265
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,618
<i>He found me.</i>

266
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,036
Hurry, Gil!

267
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:08,670
<i>There.</i>

268
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,134
<i>I found her!</i>

269
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:21,724
I'm coming, Ushioh!

270
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:33,653
<i>So dark. I can't see anything.</i>

271
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,698
<i>Where am I?</i>

272
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:41,035
<i>What was I doing?</i>

273
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:45,248
Shinpei?

274
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:52,088
You really won't go to say goodbye?

275
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,673
Shinpei is leaving.

276
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,049
Let him!

277
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:57,760
I don't care about him anymore.

278
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:03,766
<i>Wait. No, don't go!</i>

279
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,937
<i>Shinpei... I miss you.</i>

280
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:10,982
Ushioh!

281
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:18,114
Huh? Who's that?

282
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,827
Is someone calling me?

283
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,246
Ushioh!

284
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:26,706
Shinpei?

285
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,253
Wh-What the heck? Whoa!

286
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:48,102
A-A baby? What are you?
Where'd you come from?

287
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:49,937
Got you.

288
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:56,110
Why are you here? Shinpei? You came back?

289
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:57,528
Yes.

290
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:07,497
I came to get you.

291
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:09,457
What?

292
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:36,025
I remember now. I knew you'd come through!

293
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:38,152
You're back.

294
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:39,612
Yep.

295
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:46,035
Ushioh! Don't let them grab us!

296
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,497
No worries! Piece of cake!

297
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:55,002
I'm back and better than ever!

298
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
