1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,612
You came back.

2
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:12,201
But Ushioh's presence disappeared.

3
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:15,955
I am so happy
that little pest is finally gone.

4
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:51,592
{\an8}MADE IN BLACK

5
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:54,678
Heine.

6
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:01,143
Darn it.

7
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:09,276
Akari!

8
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:17,243
You can take the boy away.
He's not that tasty anyway.

9
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,119
<i>Immunity?</i>

10
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:25,084
You know,
since you just came back, Shinpei...

11
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,044
You're right on the edge.

12
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:34,260
<i>The event horizon.
I'm right on the edge after looping.</i>

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,430
<i>It's all over if I die here.
This is bad. She was targeting this.</i>

14
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:41,308
<i>Did she turn into a crow
and watch me the entire time?</i>

15
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:00,494
<i>It's useless.</i>

16
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:04,581
<i>I can't defeat even one alone.</i>

17
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:06,375
Brother!

18
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,921
It's okay, Akari. I'll protect you.

19
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:12,756
<i>No good.</i>

20
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:18,220
<i>Don't give up. It's all over if I die.
Step back and assess the situation!</i>

21
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:22,725
Wait. Stop!

22
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,898
If you make me loop, you won't
have copied Akari either. Is that okay?

23
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:36,822
Or is it that you can pass over
the data you copied too?

24
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:41,994
Didn't you eat all those people
at the festival that day?

25
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,747
It's all your fault.

26
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,461
<i>I used my power to
chase after you that time.</i>

27
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:56,884
Your life ends here.

28
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,344
Darn it...

29
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:02,222
Bye-bye.

30
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,104
Wait.

31
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,445
<i>It stopped?</i>

32
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:19,406
You!

33
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,709
It flew away.

34
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:36,465
Does this mean the danger is gone for now?

35
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:41,845
<i>They disappeared? The strays too?
Why was I saved?</i>

36
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:47,476
This is...

37
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:52,106
Darn it...

38
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:53,273
What's wrong?

39
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:54,733
Nothing.

40
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,862
<i>I have to call everyone.</i>

41
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:04,868
But...

42
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,913
Ushioh died?

43
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:14,253
Yes. The situation has changed.
Let's meet and review our strategy.

44
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:18,132
Okay. Where?

45
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:25,055
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO
UNSTABLE CONNECTION. FIND BETTER SIGNAL.

46
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,517
<i>How about Torajima Island
on the northwest of the island?</i>

47
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:31,770
<i>That small island you can only reach
during low tides?</i>

48
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:37,067
Yes. The tide drops in 30 minutes.
I told Mio and Sou too.

49
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,987
I'll meet them at Bistro Kofune
before we head out.

50
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,782
<i>Understood. Let's meet
at Torajima Island in 30 minutes.</i>

51
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:47,870
Yes. See you then.

52
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,373
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO
UNSTABLE CONNECTION. FIND BETTER SIGNAL

53
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,584
Darn it. I can't reach them.

54
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,378
Let's get down quickly.
This place is dangerous.

55
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:57,296
Okay.

56
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,633
<i>I need to tell everyone
that Ushioh disappeared!</i>

57
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:02,718
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO

58
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:06,722
When did you copy that body, Heine?

59
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:11,435
Step back and think.
Ushioh had no memory of it.

60
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,271
A hole in their pseudo-loop.

61
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,482
Wonderful.

62
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:20,694
I will not allow Shinpei to survive
till tomorrow's ceremony.

63
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,405
Let's move, Shide.

64
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,241
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

65
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:27,367
BISTRO KOFUNE

66
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:28,827
We're back!

67
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,624
W-Where is Mio?

68
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:40,881
She went out with Sou to meet you
30 minutes ago.

69
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:43,258
Where? What place?

70
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,010
I didn't hear about it.

71
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,889
-Shinpei! What happened?
-Please watch those kids!

72
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,392
Are you hungry?

73
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:54,102
We...

74
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:57,773
I'll have some mixed juice, please.

75
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,192
<i>-They either do not have a signal...
-Meeting me?</i>

76
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:02,194
<i>-or have their phone turned off.
-Is there a shadow of me?</i>

77
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:06,281
<i>Why? I wasn't copied this time.</i>

78
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:11,370
<i>I already prevented my being copied
at the funeral and at Koba Mart.</i>

79
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:15,624
<i>No. That's not it!</i>

80
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:17,084
You want to copy him, too?

81
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:21,421
No, he is... Mother already copied him.

82
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:25,926
<i>It was Heine who copied me!</i>

83
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:30,514
<i>Heine came from the end of
the festival in the third loop.</i>

84
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:35,519
<i>My shadow from that time
is now being used.</i>

85
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:38,689
<i>How did she call them from my phone?</i>

86
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:43,735
<i>Even if she copied it,
she needed to eliminate the original.</i>

87
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,364
Shinpei?

88
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:49,658
<i>From my room?</i>

89
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:55,956
Why are you here?

90
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,834
Mioh! Who did this to you?

91
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,378
It can't be. That call...

92
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,592
Ow...

93
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,219
You should take them out more gently.

94
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,554
S-Sorry.

95
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:15,142
I will give you my memories.

96
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:17,853
Mio.

97
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:22,482
Sis died. So it's dangerous if
the hacking gets reversed.

98
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:27,070
Shinpei said it!
It might become an enemy again!

99
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:30,324
No way... Mio did it?

100
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:36,204
You called her and told her
Sis died. Is that true?

101
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:41,752
Yes. But I didn't call her.
My shadow tricked her.

102
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:43,420
Does it hurt?

103
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:49,009
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I couldn't protect Mio though.

104
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:54,389
<i>I knew there was a shadow of you.
I saw it in Sis's pseudo-loop.</i>

105
00:08:55,557 --> 00:09:01,063
I also heard you say
Heine copied you and created it.

106
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:07,944
Right. But I can't believe my phone and
a copy can work and exist simultaneously.

107
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:09,279
I was careless.

108
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:10,947
<i>I just remembered.</i>

109
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:15,827
<i>During the third loop,
it also copied my phone.</i>

110
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:20,123
<i>That was sucked
into Heine's body at the end.</i>

111
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,170
<i>I see. So Heine brought it over
to this eighth loop.</i>

112
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:31,635
This is bad. Heine knows Ms. Nagumo's
memories and her contacts.

113
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,261
Where did Mio and Sou go?

114
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,307
Ms. Nagumo.

115
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,225
Hello?

116
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,142
<i>Yo.</i>

117
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:41,061
<i>It's me.</i>

118
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:42,104
<i>My voice.</i>

119
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:46,400
How does it feel to
get a call from yourself?

120
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:53,156
Heine? How do you have
Ms. Nagumo's phone? What happened?

121
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,868
Come see for yourself, Observer.

122
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,579
<i>Hizuru and the others are
on Torajima Island.</i>

123
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:01,665
<i>Mio and Sou are in Alain's field.</i>

124
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:06,795
<i>It's up to you
which group you want to save.</i>

125
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:11,133
W-Wait! Hello?

126
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:12,634
It hung up.

127
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:16,304
Calm down, Shinpei.
Think about different possibilities.

128
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:17,472
I know!

129
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:22,978
Heine is thinking as you now.
It's stepping back and thinking too.

130
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:25,313
<i>Think.</i>

131
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:31,069
<i>Why would Heine go through this effort?
Mio or Ms. Nagumo?</i>

132
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:34,614
She may be lying and everyone is dead.

133
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,409
Even still, I can't just do nothing.

134
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:42,372
It's better to regret doing something
than regret doing nothing.

135
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,296
{\an8}<i>Gather everything that can
be a weapon! Everything!</i>

136
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,507
TEN MINUTES EARLIER

137
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:54,301
ALAIN'S FIELD

138
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:55,969
Why are you here?

139
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:58,013
Mr. Karikiri.

140
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,557
Such impressive cucumbers.

141
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,894
Alain is so good at growing vegetables.

142
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,979
Right? Mio.

143
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:07,230
Step back, Mio.

144
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:10,484
I usually like rice bran pickles,

145
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:14,154
but I got the taste for vinegar pickles
after eating them here.

146
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,407
Nothing like the taste of France.

147
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,867
What did you do with Shinpei?

148
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:23,330
But Mother hates both.

149
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,374
Isn't that a pickle?

150
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,504
How do people taste?

151
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,592
{\an8}SIMULTANEOUSLY, 10:40 A.M.

152
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,261
{\an8}TORAJIMA ISLAND

153
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:40,847
What happened?

154
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:45,185
This terrain is dangerous.

155
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,354
Wh-What do you mean?

156
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:51,274
Hizuru, It really was Shinpei
on the phone, wasn't it?

157
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:55,779
Even Ryunosuke can't tell
if it's a human or shadow on the phone.

158
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,449
It certainly came
from Shinpei Ajiro's phone.

159
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:06,331
Ushioh was killed, right?
Maybe Shinpei was already killed too.

160
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:07,916
<i>Yes. That's possible.</i>

161
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,335
<i>Shinpei's loop may have been cut off</i>

162
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:13,672
<i>and we've entered the world
observed by Heine.</i>

163
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:19,886
That doesn't change what we must do.
Kill Heine. That is all.

164
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,805
Can you call Mio?

165
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,100
No. We don't have a signal here.

166
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:30,981
Alain said before that Mio and Sou
went out to meet Shinpei.

167
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,692
Hopefully, they're headed this way.

168
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:36,027
<i>Mio.</i>

169
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,823
I'll cross to Torajima Island alone first.

170
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,825
Can you target it from here, Nezu?

171
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:44,494
Just the south side of the island.

172
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:48,915
That's enough. I'll send you a signal
if Shinpei is a shadow.

173
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,919
Tokiko, charge in with Gil and Rose
when that happens.

174
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,421
I understand.

175
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:56,131
Then Totsumura...

176
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,467
Why are you here again?

177
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,719
What?

178
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,429
Whatever. Just survive.

179
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:08,643
Okay. What about your weapon?

180
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,315
I have this.

181
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,734
Don't let your guard down.

182
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:19,070
We'll come back here
once I confirm that it's really Shinpei.

183
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,280
Got it!

184
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,867
See you soon, Hizuru.

185
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,873
You're so tactless, old man.
Don't raise them death flags so quickly.

186
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,458
What? Flags?

187
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,252
I'll write a novel
about my experiences here

188
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,796
once this battle is over.

189
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,842
I've never written non-fiction before.

190
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:04,616
<i>Lightly, but surely, it echoes in my head.</i>

191
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:09,621
<i>A sound that grinds on the nerves,
like nails on a chalkboard.</i>

192
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:18,380
<i>I feel it. A shadow.</i>

193
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:22,092
<i>No. This is Heine.</i>

194
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:26,429
<i>I need to draw it toward me
for Nezu to have a shot.</i>

195
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:28,390
<i>Can it read my mind?</i>

196
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:32,852
Ms. Nagumo! I'm glad you're okay.
Where is everyone else?

197
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:37,357
Quit your lousy acting, Heine.
I can see you transformed.

198
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,818
Where is Shinpei?

199
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:48,994
<i>I said I would kill you
the next time we met 14 years ago.</i>

200
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:50,954
Right here.

201
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,126
Goodbye, Ryunosuke.

202
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:16,855
Impressive.

203
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:21,192
Are you Shide? Masahito Karikiri.

204
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:23,653
But you're human.

205
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:27,240
I don't sense a shadow in you.

206
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:31,578
Did you sneak up behind Ushioh
and kill her like that?

207
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,915
Oh my. This trick didn't work.

208
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:40,670
You have good detection capabilities,
Ryunosuke Minakata.

209
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:45,341
So you knew my secret.

210
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:50,180
I copied Ryunosuke Minakata 14 years ago.

211
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:53,641
<i>However, my personality at the time</i>

212
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:58,104
<i>could not face the guilt of
eating my friend's brother.</i>

213
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:01,566
<i>Ryunosuke's data exploded from me.</i>

214
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,278
That was a serious accident indeed.

215
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:09,074
Coordinates were slightly off
when they got printed.

216
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:11,659
Coordinates? Ow.

217
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:14,454
Not of position, but coordinates of time.

218
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,124
There is a two-second gap, to be precise.

219
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,417
Oh my.

220
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:24,589
He is moving Hizuru's body
from two seconds in the future.

221
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,717
Is that right, Hizuru?

222
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:32,806
I know you can hear me, Hizuru.

223
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:36,768
You approached Heine and confused her.

224
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,230
<i>It is your fault that
Heine was deeply hurt.</i>

225
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:46,069
<i>She got weaker. Now she can
only survive here for a few months.</i>

226
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:50,615
This is your fault, Hizuru.

227
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,912
Your precious brother's death
is the whole reason Heine must leave.

228
00:16:56,412 --> 00:17:00,416
This is all your fault, Hizuru!

229
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,502
What did you say?

230
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:06,339
I won't let you hurt Sis anymore!

231
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:10,176
You can't beat me, Ryunosuke.

232
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:16,724
Heine's eye can observe
the next two seconds and tell it to me.

233
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:21,104
This means your two-second advantage
is meaningless.

234
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,439
This is mud.

235
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:29,320
Formerly shadows, but now just nothing.

236
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:37,495
I will tell you about my abilities.
Games must be fair to be interesting.

237
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:41,958
This changes shape as I will it.

238
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:46,296
How disgusting.
How many people are in that?

239
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,424
What would Sis call that?

240
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:52,886
Globs of corpses? No.

241
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:57,473
Because it is no one, it has no weakness.

242
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,310
An armor of corpses.

243
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,150
It's time to take this seriously.

244
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:17,994
<i>I knew it.</i>

245
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:24,751
<i>Sis was right. You want to make me dodge
and then strike me after.</i>

246
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:29,214
<i>But Shide cannot see
where I am two seconds ahead.</i>

247
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:33,259
<i>Heine sees it and tells Shide
through telepathy.</i>

248
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,428
<i>There is a tiny time lag.</i>

249
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,805
<i>I need to move quicker.</i>

250
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,310
<i>Even quicker!</i>

251
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,855
<i>I just need to move quicker!</i>

252
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:37,573
Amazing. You can move like that
with a human body.

253
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:41,786
But it appears
you pushed yourself too far.

254
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:45,164
You opened your wound.

255
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:49,377
I gave you that wound last night.

256
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:54,632
<i>You had to cover Shinpei.</i>

257
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:57,593
<i>That isn't it.</i>

258
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:03,933
<i>There was a fracture in my right arm.
My muscles are also torn.</i>

259
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:07,770
<i>Sis's body can't take more than this.</i>

260
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:13,109
<i>As much as it pains me,
I need to run away. I sent the signal.</i>

261
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:18,448
<i>If I can get into Nezu's range,
he can provide me some cover to escape.</i>

262
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:19,449
<i>Wait.</i>

263
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:27,165
Sis?

264
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:31,711
Don't run away. Don't run away, Ryunosuke.

265
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:33,921
Is that Hizuru?

266
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,551
What? Why am I awake
while Sis is taking the body?

267
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,554
I'm talking with Sis in real-time
for the first time!

268
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:46,601
No way! Is this a dream? Hey! Why? Wow!

269
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:48,144
Jeez, just shut up!

270
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:51,481
This is an emergency. It can't be helped.

271
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,193
Sis! I'm so glad.

272
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:58,071
Listen closely, Ryunosuke.

273
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,114
We can win.

274
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,080
As long as Shinpei Ajiro may be alive,
we need to fight.

275
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:09,457
We'll just die tomorrow if we run.

276
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,375
But...

277
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,420
Don't think. Let me do the thinking.

278
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,550
You saw it. That material goes
beyond common sense.

279
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:24,097
However, he is just a human
if we can remove that armor.

280
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:29,310
Listen. You're the only one
who can pull this off.

281
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:38,945
I'll give you control of the body.
Stay focused, Ryunosuke.

282
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:45,618
You're holding back to avoid
harming me, aren't you?

283
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:51,874
I don't care if my body is destroyed.
Use it to the fullest!

284
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
