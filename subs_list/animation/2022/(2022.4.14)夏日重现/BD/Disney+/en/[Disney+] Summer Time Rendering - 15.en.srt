1
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:09,406
Shinpei!

2
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:36,100
Shinpei.

3
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:40,563
A sniper shot from
outside the window. A rifle.

4
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:44,525
No! They got to Mr. Nezu.

5
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,486
I didn't sense any shadows.

6
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:53,242
A shadow bullet didn't kill you.
It was a real rifle bullet.

7
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,912
It was a mistake to let Mr. Nezu be alone.

8
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,084
He went beyond the range
that you can detect shadows.

9
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,171
This is all on me!

10
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:08,716
They found out that
Mr. Nezu was our sniper.

11
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:14,096
Darn it. I assumed
they'd just aim for me directly.

12
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:22,479
Wait, I thought they wanted
to capture you alive?

13
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:25,524
You'll just loop,
so why did they kill you?

14
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,152
They realized it…

15
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:32,781
probably because Heine is looping with me.

16
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:37,870
I told you that the starting point
gets later each time.

17
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:42,249
I can see it. My limit is getting close.

18
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,257
The ledge of time is
slowly but surely crumbling.

19
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:55,137
If I get killed at the same time,
most likely…

20
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:59,058
I can only loop one more time.

21
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:33,027
JULY 22
(SEVENTH LOOP)

22
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:37,239
{\an8}You have only one loop left?

23
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,407
{\an8}LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION

24
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,911
{\an8}If this is the limit,
I return to this point each time I die.

25
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,000
{\an8}<i>I can't go back past the limit,
so this is the starting point.</i>

26
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,084
{\an8}TIME - LIMIT: 6:40, DEATH: 7:55

27
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:54,715
{\an8}<i>Last time, I died at 7:55,
and my starting point was 6:40.</i>

28
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:55,632
LIMIT: 6:40

29
00:03:55,716 --> 00:04:00,220
<i>It's like I am steadily walking forward
from that point.</i>

30
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:05,184
<i>It is currently 7:20.
The limit moves forward as well.</i>

31
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:09,605
The limit can't catch up to me now
since it still moves slower than I do,

32
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,649
but it gets faster each time I die.

33
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:17,321
If you die now,
when is the next starting point?

34
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,200
Well, based on the past…

35
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,661
maybe a little past seven o'clock.

36
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,040
That was a few minutes ago!

37
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:35,464
If I die any earlier than the last time,
I probably won't get a ninth loop.

38
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,592
<i>While I'm treading in time…</i>

39
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:42,054
<i>the limit will pass me by.</i>

40
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:45,891
There would be nothing to return to.

41
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:49,436
<i>I would fall into the darkness below.</i>

42
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:56,652
Hey, are you serious?
It's not just your imagination?

43
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:00,239
He is an observer. It must be true.

44
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:04,660
<i>That cliff is an event horizon.</i>

45
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:11,792
If he falls, his death is fixed.
The world Heine sees will become reality.

46
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:16,547
Heine realized that and came to kill you.

47
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,464
That's horrible!

48
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,675
How did they find me?

49
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,929
Heine may have discovered
our strategy in the fourth loop.

50
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:31,061
I must have been scanned
when I was fatally wounded at the end.

51
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,606
They must have read my memory
leading up to it.

52
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:42,114
How do shadows exchange information?
Do they show their memories like you?

53
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:48,078
Yes, they can also talk or write.
Heine also uses telepathy.

54
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:53,709
Shadows experience pseudo loops
if they came in contact with Heine.

55
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:57,629
Hold it. Data is passed through loops.

56
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:01,508
Could they have copied my rifle?

57
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:05,596
If so, this place is not safe.

58
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,435
We're fine. A copied item will disappear
if it's too far from the printer shadow.

59
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:16,607
<i>Copied items can't exist
beyond a 50-meter radius from the shadow.</i>

60
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:24,031
{\an8}<i>So a bullet from the copied sniper rifle
will only have a 50-meter range.</i>

61
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,910
Then even an unlimited supply of bullets
would be meaningless.

62
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,497
The enemy won last time,
but we also learned a lot.

63
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:35,667
This mark means Heine knows where I am.

64
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,963
Heine will definitely come here
to watch me die.

65
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,674
Let's finish this here tonight.

66
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,070
Shinpei, they're coming from the front.

67
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:14,331
You have quite a large entourage, Shide.

68
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:19,503
You've gathered many
to your side too, Shinpei.

69
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:25,175
I don't see them here,
so they must be hiding.

70
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,636
Is it a trap?

71
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,431
I'm not like you
to use any underhanded tricks.

72
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:35,894
Let's stop playing games
and fight face-to-face.

73
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:40,274
Oh? You sound so confident.

74
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:44,486
It would be our pleasure. Right, Mioh?

75
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:48,031
Yes. As I expected of Shinpei.

76
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,325
So cool!

77
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,625
What?

78
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:02,045
Sis?

79
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,966
<i>If they're after my life,
then I'll be the bait.</i>

80
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:07,175
He ran away.

81
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,927
What happened to a face-to-face fight?

82
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:12,139
Where are you taking Shinpei?

83
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:18,687
Shinpei Ajiro, you dirty rat.

84
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:25,068
That Shide shadow has no weakness.
Is it invincible?

85
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:26,403
Hurry!

86
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,947
<i>Wait, Mioh.</i>

87
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,665
Excuse me.

88
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:45,881
What?

89
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,468
Papa and Mama, come with me.

90
00:08:54,389 --> 00:09:00,145
<i>We'll go after Shinpei and Ushioh.
Finish the hunter, Mioh.</i>

91
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:05,108
Yes. I understand, Mother.

92
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:12,074
Ryunosuke!

93
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:16,036
Leave this to me.

94
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,287
Please!

95
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,958
You won't be able to hear me now,

96
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:25,671
but I forgot to tell you
something important, Ryunosuke.

97
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:30,092
Thank you.

98
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:38,141
Darn it! It's coming! Your turn!

99
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,230
That's my shadow!

100
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,232
I got it!

101
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:51,279
What the… Darn it!

102
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:56,702
You're so dumb, Brother.
You get so fired up easily.

103
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,543
S-Sorry, Tokiko.

104
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,004
Rosencrantz.

105
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,382
Guildenstern.

106
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:15,887
Explode. Like a bomb. Quietly.

107
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:33,864
Hizuru…

108
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,198
Asako!

109
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:38,285
Go left.

110
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:42,706
That bullet should have hit.

111
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,886
I told you he'd take a hit for them.

112
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:00,223
<i>I see…</i>

113
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:01,683
Ryu…

114
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:06,563
<i>It can see how I move two seconds ahead.</i>

115
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,816
Bingo!

116
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:19,326
Nezu!

117
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:29,377
That old man doesn't even need the scope.
He's quite the shot.

118
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:32,964
Are you okay, Shide?

119
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:37,803
Go and hide. It's dangerous here.

120
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:39,846
Oh, my.

121
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,310
What is taking Mioh so long?

122
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:52,192
Tokiko?

123
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,070
Crush it, Gil.

124
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:03,703
<i>Stop. Your boss is no longer Tokiko.</i>

125
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:09,251
<i>Kill Tokiko!</i>

126
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,338
<i>Kill Tokiko!</i>

127
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:24,933
What's wrong, Heine?

128
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:28,770
That stray shadow's link with me
is cut off.

129
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:31,106
The only one who can do that is…

130
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:34,734
Ushioh.

131
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:37,779
I dare you to come get me!

132
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,490
Is this your doing?

133
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:50,834
Well, they are certainly making this fun.

134
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,907
<i>What a graceful body.</i>

135
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,576
<i>You were always athletic, Mio.</i>

136
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:30,332
<i>Oh, I would love to keep
watching you move, but unfortunately…</i>

137
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,546
Now, Sou!

138
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:58,902
You said you wanted
a face-to-face fight. Such lies.

139
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:05,367
This is sad. I believed you too.
I'm actually quite the trusting type.

140
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:10,372
I knew you would chase me,
even if you knew it was a trap.

141
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:12,832
You're just that cocky!

142
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,794
So you think you're above all of us?

143
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,591
Shinpei is even higher!

144
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:46,825
It's a sea of gasoline flames.
They have nowhere to escape.

145
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,208
<i>It's working.
Shadows really are weak to fire.</i>

146
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:06,344
I'm sorry, Papa and Mama. I know it's hot.

147
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:11,516
But don't worry.
I'll be back after I kill him!

148
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:14,602
Take this!

149
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:25,488
<i>If you're going to step back,
don't look away, Heine!</i>

150
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:30,368
This is for Ushio!

151
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:49,012
I got you.

152
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:52,474
I'll erase you.

153
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:58,188
Quit using Shiori's body, you fake!

154
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:02,901
Stop!

155
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:07,363
S-Stop. Please don't erase me.

156
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,909
I chose this body.

157
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,290
<i>I want to go home as her
and be with her family forever.</i>

158
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:20,335
Heine! Crying won't work on me!

159
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,088
Please…

160
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:26,966
<i>Don't erase me.</i>

161
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,224
N-No way! It's still alive!

162
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,392
Ushioh!

163
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,691
Shinpei!

164
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:55,912
Ushioh! Y-You cannot kill me with f-fire!

165
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:59,666
B-But y-you will die!

166
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:03,128
I w-was th-thinking.

167
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:08,299
Y-You and Heine carry data
into the next loop, d-don't you?

168
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:12,554
Th-That means y-you carry…

169
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:16,307
injuries and d-death too!

170
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:21,896
I-It will take a few minutes
for Shinpei to d-die.

171
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,649
I made sure not to hit his vitals.

172
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:31,948
W-What happens if y-you die b-before him?

173
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:37,871
I-I am so i-interested to see!

174
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:46,754
No…

175
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,844
No!

176
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:10,862
Sorry to ruin your experiment,
but I don't plan on dying!

177
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:16,034
How smooth. I didn't notice
you changing places.

178
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:19,329
I g-grabbed…

179
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:23,291
a dummy printed on a lock of hair.

180
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:32,634
You're not invincible. I'll erase you!

181
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:41,476
<i>It's a human hand. Someone is inside it!</i>

182
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:54,948
The flames disappeared.

183
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,247
I can't breathe… Heine…

184
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:06,668
What did you do…

185
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:28,856
What the heck happened?

186
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:32,986
They ran away.

187
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:37,323
I was so close to erasing it.

188
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:41,536
Ushioh!

189
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,918
<i>Shide, are you okay?</i>

190
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,421
<i>Yes. I can mold myself back together.</i>

191
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:54,465
<i>Where's Papa and Mama?</i>

192
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:57,802
<i>Shinpei is fatally wounded.</i>

193
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:02,598
<i>He'll die soon and enter his final loop.</i>

194
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,022
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

195
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:14,277
<i>I know.</i>

196
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,117
Ushioh!

197
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,413
I'm okay, Shinpei.

198
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:28,458
I'm just tired after copying so much.

199
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:34,047
But you're bleeding. Don't act so tough.

200
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,548
Shinpei.

201
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:40,511
This blood is just from the body
touching the glass.

202
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,056
Never mind me, your wounds are serious!

203
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:48,519
Bulletproof vest.
I found how to make it online.

204
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:59,364
Ow! That hurts! Stop!
My shoulder and side still got shot!

205
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:01,741
Thank goodness.

206
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:24,305
A flame caused by copied gasoline
and matches is just data.

207
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,310
Ushioh chose what burns by it.
It didn't harm the building nor us.

208
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:35,650
{\an8}Fire was effective on shadows.
Shadows made by Shide died instantly.

209
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,653
{\an8}It also slowed down Shide's movement.

210
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:44,700
{\an8}Ushioh's hacking helped us learn
that someone is inside Shide's body.

211
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:49,163
{\an8}However, Heine scanned the air
in the gymnasium and erased it.

212
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:55,294
{\an8}Outside air gushed into the building,
and Heine escaped.

213
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,006
{\an8}Ushioh was unable to scan
Shide's true identity.

214
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:03,052
The air…

215
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:06,013
We can copy gases and liquids too.

216
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:09,308
It just needs to be in some container.

217
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,729
{\an8}You were able to copy the gasoline
in the gas can.

218
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,150
{\an8}If you consider the gymnasium
a container, it is possible.

219
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:18,443
{\an8}Man…

220
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:25,408
{\an8}I hate to say it, but it's impressive.
I can't scan something so large.

221
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:27,535
I was so close.

222
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,414
{\an8}We did learn a lot from tonight, though.

223
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:32,331
{\an8}Yes.

224
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,501
{\an8}Everyone survived.

225
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,504
That's the most important thing.

226
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,174
Right.

227
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:42,383
Ushioh.

228
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:44,260
{\an8}Come with me.

229
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,429
{\an8}Like we planned?

230
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:47,722
{\an8}Yes.

231
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:50,516
{\an8}Let me ask this again, Ushioh.

232
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,689
{\an8}If you cut that link to Heine,
will it really be safe?

233
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:59,650
It worked with Rose and Gil.

234
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:02,278
Yes. I'll tweak its mind a bit.

235
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:05,656
{\an8}It'll basically be like me.

236
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:11,412
{\an8}We can kill it easily right now.
Are you sure, Mio?

237
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:15,124
{\an8}Yes. Do it, Sis.

238
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:21,797
{\an8}Make my shadow an ally.

239
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
