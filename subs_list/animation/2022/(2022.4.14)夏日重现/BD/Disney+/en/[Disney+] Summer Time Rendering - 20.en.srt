1
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:06,779
You think you can win? Hilarious.

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,075
<i>She's quick.</i>

3
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:24,505
<i>She moves faster than Ushioh,
maybe even faster.</i>

4
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:34,056
<i>Pulling out all the stops
for the final battle, Hizuru?</i>

5
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:18,410
That was a close one.
Come on, Shide. Wake up.

6
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:26,043
Up and at 'em. All right.

7
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:32,007
You're pretty good at handling
my sacred treasure, Amenonuboko.

8
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:38,472
Ryunosuke is a shadow, after all.
He can't copy, but he's good at imitating.

9
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:42,101
The wrath in each strike is shocking!

10
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:46,438
I've known you since you were a baby.

11
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,941
You hate me that much?

12
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:54,613
Why go so far?
Why risk your life to fight?

13
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,866
What I hate are your words.

14
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,326
Words?

15
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,291
Humans have language.
Human nature determines how to use words.

16
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:11,213
You'll never understand,
no matter how long you live.

17
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,676
I have one question for you.
Why did you come back, Hizuru?

18
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:22,433
Only a fool would come only to die.
It's not like you.

19
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:28,230
You should know the answer.
The last time, you scanned my mind.

20
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:33,193
Oh, perhaps it's just beyond
your comprehension?

21
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:40,284
Why don't you scan me again?
Ask my shadow to answer.

22
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,495
I'm not falling for that.

23
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:48,584
Hizuru, you must be immune.
Mioh could've done that.

24
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:53,172
You just want to destroy this body
the moment I flash.

25
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:54,298
<i>Is it that obvious?</i>

26
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:57,551
You think you can defeat Shide
if it weren't for my eye.

27
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:02,931
Then it would be easy to destroy
my real body that's underground.

28
00:04:03,015 --> 00:04:03,849
Heine.

29
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:09,605
Just wait. So answer me!
Was it because of the message?

30
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,316
That's typical of Shinpei Ajiro.

31
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:19,573
While stepping back logically,
he persists on getting answers.

32
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,450
What's with all this talking?

33
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:25,537
It's perfect to buy time.
Just let me handle it.

34
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:32,711
At first, it was curiosity.
Now I think I'd been waiting for this.

35
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,380
It's my chance to make it up to him.

36
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:36,882
Make it up to him?

37
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:41,553
Shide is right.
Ryunosuke died because of me.

38
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,974
<i>Ryunosuke's death was treated
as an accident.</i>

39
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:51,230
<i>No one blamed me.
My friends and parents consoled me.</i>

40
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:56,860
<i>I became this pitiful child
who lost her twin in an accident.</i>

41
00:04:57,861 --> 00:05:01,740
But the truth is, it's as if I killed him.

42
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:06,703
It was a miracle that I met his shadow,
and it let me apologize to him.

43
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:13,210
But that doesn't mean he's alive again.
There's one thing I can do now.

44
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:18,674
I can at least save the lives
that would otherwise be lost.

45
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,050
Yes.

46
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,803
So I will save them. I must.

47
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,723
You want to make it up to him?
So that's the reason.

48
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:32,312
How pathetic.
You risk your life for strangers?

49
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:38,152
I hate people who believe
that they're doing the right thing!

50
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,237
The right thing?

51
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:42,197
The right thing, you say?

52
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:44,658
Me?

53
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,213
You need to step back more, Heine.

54
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,968
Do you actually think
he's acting for your benefit?

55
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,011
What?

56
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:10,642
Your goal of going home and his words
in the third loop contradict.

57
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,521
You said that it was your ending.

58
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:18,442
What did you mean by that, Shide?

59
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,152
Ending?

60
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:26,116
The man only thinks of himself.
He cannot go beyond his own perspective.

61
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:30,579
Ending, huh? I'm lost.

62
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:36,376
It's nonsense, Heine.
She is trying to trick us with words.

63
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:37,711
Yes.

64
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:42,007
That means she has nothing left.

65
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:45,469
Enough of this pleasant conversation.

66
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:50,432
<i>I didn't want Heine to see,
but I can't ask for much.</i>

67
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,893
<i>The rest is up to you, Tokiko.</i>

68
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:57,356
<i>Shide's armor is no one.
It's empty inside.</i>

69
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:00,359
<i>So...</i>

70
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:06,615
<i>You can get inside it.</i>

71
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:10,369
<i>Ryunosuke, you know well
how to possess people.</i>

72
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:13,622
<i>Get into his armor
and destroy it from the inside.</i>

73
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,458
<i>What the...</i>

74
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:29,888
You...

75
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,729
<i>So this was up your sleeve, Hizuru.</i>

76
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:41,692
<i>Copying Ryunosuke's data to Shide's armor.</i>

77
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:44,361
<i>It's born?</i>

78
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:54,746
We really did it.

79
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:01,336
Sis!

80
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,058
Stand back, Shinpei. It's dangerous.

81
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:19,730
I was waiting for you.

82
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,690
Where are Mio and Sou?

83
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,403
So you did come see Mio first, Shinpei.

84
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:31,533
Stand back, Shinpei, I got him.

85
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:38,040
Shouldn't you kill Shinpei
rather than me, Mioh?

86
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,419
I sent Mio and Sou to Hiruko's grotto.

87
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:45,380
Mother is probably eating them now.

88
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:49,801
You were just a bit too late, Shinpei!

89
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:54,765
You have some guts, Shide.
You didn't run away.

90
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:59,853
I can't leave this to other shadows.
I don't want to lose any more allies.

91
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,731
A human like me can't be hacked.

92
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:04,107
What?

93
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:05,692
<i>He is afraid of hacking.</i>

94
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,153
<i>He must think Ushioh is alive.</i>

95
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:09,863
What's this?

96
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:14,326
<i>Wait. If he thinks she's alive,
I should let him.</i>

97
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,287
Oh, you got us.

98
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:24,002
Mioh, kill Shinpei and make him loop,
or it will be too late...

99
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:29,549
Okay. Well, I'll be reborn
in the next loop anyway.

100
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,387
So chatty.

101
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:44,523
Shinpei, what he said was true.
Mio just died.

102
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:45,732
You can tell?

103
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:48,902
I can feel if my original dies.

104
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:51,321
Want to go back?

105
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,199
<i>No. Not yet.</i>

106
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:58,578
We need to grasp the situation.
Search his memories.

107
00:09:58,662 --> 00:09:59,496
Okay.

108
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,381
Strange. He has no memories.

109
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,091
What do you mean?

110
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:18,348
There's no memory at all,
not even the conversation we just had.

111
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,102
What moved him around?

112
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:28,483
Shide has two bodies then.
Not shadows, but cloned humans.

113
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:32,946
He didn't have that burn on his arm.
There must be another.

114
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,407
He must be with Ms. Nagumo.

115
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:40,370
<i>She must be in danger.
Heine called from her phone.</i>

116
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,083
Shinpei. This way.

117
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:55,635
Tokiko!

118
00:10:56,636 --> 00:11:01,391
Thank goodness you're alive, Shinpei.

119
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:07,147
I came this far searching
for Mio's presence.

120
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:09,566
Tokiko. What happened?

121
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:16,323
Nezu and Totsumura let me escape.

122
00:11:16,865 --> 00:11:21,787
Go to Torajima Island. Please.

123
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:25,791
Ryunosuke is fighting Shide.

124
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,129
Save Ryunosuke, please...

125
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:45,769
She's dead.

126
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:48,897
These are Tokiko's memories.

127
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:57,906
Quickly. Let's go to Torajima Island.

128
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:05,831
<i>It's Dr. Hishigata's Derringer.
Tokiko had it.</i>

129
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:08,041
<i>One bullet left.</i>

130
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:10,919
Shinpei.

131
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,713
Okay. I'm not going.

132
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:22,055
Ryunosuke and Ms. Nagumo might be dead.
I couldn't tell from Tokiko's memories.

133
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,975
I don't have time to go and confirm it.

134
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:30,814
<i>We know that Mio is dead.
The event horizon is getting closer.</i>

135
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:33,942
If we don't hurry,
Mio's death will be set.

136
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,820
There is still time to save everyone.

137
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,700
If I loop now, it'll be around 10:10 a.m.

138
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:46,454
Oh, I was leaving Mt. Takanosu
with the kids.

139
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:47,372
You can see?

140
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:49,833
Yes, vaguely.

141
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,879
<i>But I can't stop Heine's call
at 10:10 a.m.</i>

142
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,798
First, I'll hurry back to Kofune.

143
00:12:58,341 --> 00:12:59,718
I have to save you there.

144
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:03,013
Then I'll go after Mio and Sou
to stop them.

145
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,682
Once we loop, we have to move quickly.

146
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:11,938
Follow me.
We'll save both Mio and Ms. Nagumo.

147
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:15,317
It's a battle against time.

148
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:24,034
I'm going now.

149
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,339
28 MINUTES AFTER NINTH LOOP START
10:39

150
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:41,968
-Oh!
-Whoa!

151
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:44,596
You guys.

152
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,890
Why are you here? Shinpei?

153
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:51,645
I made it in time. Mioh ran through
the sewers from Kofune to get us here.

154
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:54,189
You saved Mioh?

155
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:55,357
She's alright.

156
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,234
Why are your phones turned off?

157
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,569
What?

158
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:05,033
You told us to turn them off
in case a shadow might call.

159
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,994
Fool. That was a shadow telling you.

160
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:19,339
Sorry, Shinpei, I should have known.

161
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:24,302
It's okay. We don't have much time.
I'll head to Torajima Island with Mioh.

162
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:29,224
I'm sorry I shot you.

163
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:32,185
It hurt, but it's okay.

164
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:36,898
I just copied you and healed my wounds.
It did hurt a lot though.

165
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:38,608
I'm sorry!

166
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:42,570
Don't worry. I would've done the same.

167
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:46,992
Sou and Mio, go back to Kofune
and watch the kids.

168
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:48,201
Leave them to us!

169
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:54,457
Shinpei.

170
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,671
Save Tokiko and the others.

171
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,173
Yeah, I got this.

172
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,970
Let's go, Mioh. To Torajima Island.

173
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,807
<i>According to Tokiko's memories,</i>

174
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:14,936
<i>Ms. Nagumo sends the signal at 10:45.</i>

175
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,854
TORAJIMA ISLAND

176
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:18,398
<i>Let me get there in time. Please!</i>

177
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,031
We don't have time to fight, Mioh.

178
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,074
I'll jump. Don't bite your tongue.

179
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,425
We made it.

180
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:55,935
<i>That is Shide's attack
that I saw in Tokiko's memories!</i>

181
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,898
<i>What did it do? Rose was gone in a second.</i>

182
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:07,822
So this is how things can change.

183
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:09,115
Rose!

184
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:16,539
He's here. Quicker than I expected.

185
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:20,585
Shinpei!

186
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,087
Stand back, Tokiko.

187
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:24,380
You'll die.

188
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:29,803
I see. You looped,
so you know how this battle ends.

189
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,263
Tokiko must've told you after she escaped.

190
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:38,186
Oh, why so surprised, Shinpei?

191
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:45,819
Because you looped, we got to fight again.

192
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:49,072
No...

193
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:53,243
Thanks to you, it was an easy win.

194
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:56,121
Ms. Nagumo!

195
00:16:56,996 --> 00:17:00,500
You're too far.
Don't waste bullets, Totsumura!

196
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,876
What?

197
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:08,550
<i>Is that Heine?
Second time fighting this battle?</i>

198
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:12,679
<i>After the loop, it knew
my attack position. Darn it.</i>

199
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:17,267
<i>We've only got my hatchet,
Totsumura's Derringer,</i>

200
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,603
<i>Gil, and Mioh.</i>

201
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:26,025
<i>This isn't going to be pretty
if we fight now, Shinpei.</i>

202
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,777
We're all going to die.

203
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:28,820
What?

204
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:30,738
Shinpei. Mioh. Let's pull back.

205
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:31,865
Get on Gil.

206
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,242
Are you deaf, Shinpei?

207
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:37,704
I don't want to leave Ms. Nagumo!

208
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:43,585
Moron! We need to pull back!
Don't waste her sacrifice!

209
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:48,464
<i>This is...</i>

210
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,852
Let's go, Shide.

211
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,939
We're outnumbered. This is enough for now.

212
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,568
I understand.

213
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:20,163
W-We're safe.

214
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:24,083
Ms. Nagumo! Stay with me!

215
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,381
I-Is that you, Shinpei...

216
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:31,549
Ms. Nagumo.

217
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:39,432
I-I'm sorry. I said I would save you.

218
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:41,684
It was a promise...

219
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:46,022
But I don't think I can keep it.

220
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,025
That's not true! Not at all!

221
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:51,486
Totsumura! Give me the gun!

222
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,071
Oh, here!

223
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,033
I'm going back.

224
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,076
No.

225
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,954
I'll save you next time.

226
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,414
Stop. It's too late.

227
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:14,259
You know more than anyone.
The loop ability is reaching the limit.

228
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,971
You can't save both of them.

229
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,646
We need to take her to the hospital.
I'm sure Mioh can...

230
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:30,650
Listen closely.

231
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:37,282
Heine is just a child.

232
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,826
<i>She may be a monster,</i>

233
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:46,124
<i>but her original personality
is shy and wants to be loved.</i>

234
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,460
<i>She's just a child.</i>

235
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:54,966
Shide's aim is not the same as Heine's.

236
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:00,847
Heine is probably just
being used by Shide.

237
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:04,392
Shide is the one in charge.

238
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:14,736
Shinpei, please free Heine.

239
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:18,239
I will. I promise.

240
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:22,869
Enough. Don't talk anymore, Hizuru.

241
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:28,750
It's not such a bad way to end.

242
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,463
Stop being so gloomy.

243
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:38,468
It doesn't matter how long I've lived...

244
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:44,307
but how I used my life to the fullest.

245
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:11,584
I'm putting my brother in your care.

246
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:16,464
What a comeback story this will be.

247
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:47,537
Hey, Hizuru?

248
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:53,042
Hizuru!

249
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
