1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:05,236
This is not the first time
you are living July 22nd.

2
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:08,072
You must have repeated the day many times.

3
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:12,910
In other words, you are a time traveler.

4
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:15,121
Yes.

5
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:19,875
I see, but the one who told you my name
was probably not me.

6
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:22,545
Did you meet my brother?

7
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:34,140
<i>Next up, we have a report
from Kinokawa City.</i>

8
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:39,395
Let's hear about delicious
Wakayama treats for the summer.

9
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:41,564
Please tell us all about that--

10
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:47,278
{\an8}KOBA MART
YOMOGIMOCHI

11
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:50,406
It's time, Ryunosuke.

12
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,256
THIRD LOOP
JULY 24 (TUESDAY)

13
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:34,718
{\an8}Very interesting. It could even be
the plot of my next novel.

14
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:39,431
It's so confusing.
It went right over my head.

15
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:44,687
This book is proof that you believe me.
<i>Swamp Man</i> is a true story.

16
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,565
The Swamp Man in this story
is exactly like the shadows…

17
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:51,485
and the protagonist has
the same name as you.

18
00:02:56,407 --> 00:03:01,578
Fourteen years ago, I met a shadow
on this island. It killed my family.

19
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:08,544
That's the reason why I believe you.

20
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:10,838
But… That's…

21
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:14,675
I won't say anything more.
It would reveal who I am.

22
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:20,139
If I told you and you were copied,
a shadow could learn who I really am.

23
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:22,850
Shadows go after the family.

24
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,603
Since Hizuru returned to this island,
they'll be after her too.

25
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,605
<i>Fa-Family.</i>

26
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:34,528
<i>Is that why Ushio, Mio, and I
were targeted? Wait…</i>

27
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:35,571
What about Alain?

28
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:39,366
Don't worry, I already took care
of Alain's shadow.

29
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,828
His shadow will
no longer be able to return.

30
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:46,081
It's just like chickenpox.
You develop an immunity.

31
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:51,754
If your shadow is killed,
you'll never get shadow sickness again.

32
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:56,717
So if you kill your own shadow,
you can't be copied again.

33
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,762
Yes. That's why I got immunity.

34
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:05,184
My shadow won't exist. You can trust me.

35
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:11,023
But Ms. Nagumo, you have no immunity.
Why did you risk coming back?

36
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,484
I can't tell you that, either. However…

37
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,071
I came to save you, that's for sure.

38
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:19,948
Although you might not want
to trust me too much.

39
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:21,909
No, I…

40
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,830
What is your plan?

41
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:31,794
We have 54 hours until everyone is killed
at the summer festival.

42
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,129
That four-armed shadow…

43
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:37,299
It seemed to control
all the other shadows.

44
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,843
My sister Mio is in danger.

45
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,930
Will you help me defeat Mio's shadow?

46
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:49,478
Your notes said Mio's shadow will appear
at Bistro Kofune at 9 p.m. tonight.

47
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,396
Yes.

48
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,358
Fine. But I need to handle
one thing before that.

49
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,443
The Kobayakawa family, right?

50
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,781
You're bound to fail.

51
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,491
What?

52
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:07,454
<i>I saw Shiori's shadow
on the grounds on the 24th.</i>

53
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,167
You're saying that I will fail
to kill Shiori today.

54
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:17,673
Yes. So let me come with you.
It is my enemy too.

55
00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:22,136
Even if we fail again, I can find out why.

56
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,102
Okay. However, I will be
the only one who will enter the house.

57
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:33,522
KOBA MART

58
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:37,484
What is she doing?
She's been listening to something.

59
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:41,738
She doesn't have any memories
of being Hizuru.

60
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,616
Roger that. Sis.

61
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:51,081
<i>The famous Arakawa peaches
grown here in Momoyama,</i>

62
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:55,961
<i>loved by people all across Japan,
are in season now!</i>

63
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,673
Hi, Hizuru!

64
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,718
Hey, did I catch you at dinner…
I mean, excuse me.

65
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:05,137
I had some gifts from Tokyo to give you.

66
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,098
Oh! You shouldn't have!

67
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:09,308
<i>Let her in.</i>

68
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,060
Oh, come in.

69
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:13,228
Thank you.

70
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,940
This is my husband Tatsuo
and my daughter Shiori.

71
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:19,109
Hello, make yourself comfortable.

72
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:22,821
I hope I'm not interrupting, Asako.
Can I open my luggage here?

73
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:26,867
Of course.
Hizuru, why don't you stay for dinner?

74
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,994
We have so much catching up to do.

75
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:31,538
I was wondering…

76
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:32,456
What is it?

77
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,417
Does Ms. Nagumo have a split personality?

78
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,797
No thanks, I won't stay long.

79
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:52,100
<i>The shadow itself is flat,
so a body blow will not hurt it.</i>

80
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:54,311
Mama?

81
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,773
<i>It is merely the eyes of the body
that is looking at me.</i>

82
00:06:57,856 --> 00:07:02,486
<i>If they knew I could kill them,
they would be cautious and avoid me.</i>

83
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,363
<i>So it's best to kill them both
at the same time.</i>

84
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,366
Asako!

85
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,326
<i>I only reeled in one.</i>

86
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,247
Split personality? Why do you say that?

87
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,210
She asked if I met her brother.
That has to mean…

88
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:21,672
Well, you aren't too far off,
but that's not it.

89
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:26,885
Can she really handle this alone?

90
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,887
We wait here.

91
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:32,808
Ryunosuke has the power to battle shadows.

92
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:34,977
Ryunosuke?

93
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,980
Yes. Ryunosuke's a tough one.

94
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:45,362
Let me be clear.
I don't get your loop or whatever.

95
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,281
But if you go inside,

96
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:51,702
it might change the reason
to let Shiori's shadow escape.

97
00:07:56,164 --> 00:08:00,085
Ryunosuke is trying to find
the cause of the failure.

98
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,347
Listen up. She trusts you.

99
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:19,813
You said she's not dying today.
If that was a lie, I'll never forgive you.

100
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:21,565
Yes.

101
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:23,859
<i>Ms. Nagumo was certainly strong.</i>

102
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:28,614
<i>It was Ryunosuke.</i>

103
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:34,202
Mr. Nezu, can you tell me about Ryunosuke?

104
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:38,040
I guess it wouldn't take much to find out.

105
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,961
<i>Hizuru had a twin younger brother.</i>

106
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,339
His name was Ryunosuke.

107
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,093
He was found dead
in Mount Takanosu 14 years ago.

108
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:56,558
<i>I heard Hizuru scream, so I ran over.
It was a hideous sight.</i>

109
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,019
Papa! Mama!

110
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,442
This can't be real… Why? Why kill them?

111
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:09,946
He was eaten.

112
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:16,870
Chunks of his body were bitten off.
People thought it was wild dogs.

113
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:20,707
Hizuru claimed that it was murder.

114
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:27,923
Along with those bite wounds,
he had strangulation marks.

115
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:30,759
<i>I missed.</i>

116
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,179
<i>No, I felt a hit.</i>

117
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:39,393
But no one believed Hizuru.

118
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,478
The body was cremated that same day.

119
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,898
Mr. Nezu, that's like Ushio's…

120
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:49,903
Yeah, wasn't it similar?
All this could be related.

121
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,531
<i>There are monsters on this island.</i>

122
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:56,785
<i>I want to kill every single shadow
on this island…</i>

123
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:58,787
even if it costs me my life.

124
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:02,666
Can you say the same, Shinpei?

125
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,334
Yes.

126
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:11,508
You're dangerous. You know how to kill us.

127
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,969
Is that traitor on your side?

128
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:17,681
I see you could follow
Mama and Papa's movements…

129
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,058
and you move quicker than shadows.

130
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:21,560
Are you really human?

131
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:28,525
Copy me and create my shadow,
and then you ask it.

132
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:33,238
So smug. Fine, I'll do that.

133
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:36,199
After I kill you.

134
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:44,624
You old hag! How dare you stab yourself
just to hurt me!

135
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:52,716
<i>Did I not strike deep enough?</i>

136
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,220
<i>Strange, that first hammer strike
should've been fatal.</i>

137
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,055
<i>Something is different about that shadow.</i>

138
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:04,227
<i>Sorry, Sis, I hurt your body.</i>

139
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:07,189
<i>So it went to the third floor.</i>

140
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,941
<i>It's exactly like Sis said.</i>

141
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:13,069
{\an8}It's from her.

142
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:15,697
CHANGE TO PLAN B

143
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:16,740
Plan B.

144
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:21,077
Now it's our turn. Here.

145
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:27,375
Let's see how serious you are about this.

146
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:42,849
{\an8}BEDROOM 2 (KIDS' ROOM)
NORTH BALCONY

147
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:46,812
<i>Third floor, north side window.</i>

148
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,194
DIARY
SHIORI KOBAYAKAWA

149
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:01,117
It's useless.

150
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:06,122
After you release the light to copy,
you cannot move for a few seconds.

151
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:13,296
I guess it takes quite an effort
to scan information on one human.

152
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,341
Do you think I'll waste those few seconds?

153
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:21,638
The moment you try to copy me,
I'll kill you.

154
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,432
It'll be for sure this time.

155
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:26,893
No fun.

156
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:36,778
Bye-bye.

157
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:50,208
It's Plan B.

158
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,088
The third shot…

159
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,387
Bring it!

160
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,809
Running away? Get over here!

161
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:10,520
Damn it!

162
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,157
Shinpei!

163
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,578
No… Stop…

164
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:29,372
You… Did you do it?

165
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:31,249
Get off me, you scum.

166
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,710
Did you kill Ushio?

167
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,254
Ow!

168
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:41,301
That's enough. Let it go, Shinpei.

169
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:44,763
It can't move an inch anymore.

170
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,436
One or two won't do it.
We nail it down in three spots.

171
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,857
Then the shadow gets stuck in place.

172
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,985
In other words, you can capture it.

173
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:01,529
Capture?

174
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:04,741
That was your intention from the start?

175
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:05,659
Yeah.

176
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:07,035
I didn't know!

177
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:10,497
Well, I didn't tell you.
I didn't expect you to be helpful.

178
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,961
<i>This is huge that we captured Shiori.
It will change the future.</i>

179
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:21,675
Once the body is pinned down,
I guess the shadow can't escape.

180
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:26,429
This is a new discovery, Shinpei.
Thanks to you, we didn't lose it.

181
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:31,518
If it were just the two of us,
we would have failed.

182
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:35,772
You've got some guts for a youngin'.

183
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,607
Good job.

184
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:44,990
What's so funny?

185
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:51,705
This shadow is different from the others.
I chose Plan B to examine it.

186
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,665
Different?

187
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:57,419
First, let's get it to answer
Shinpei's question.

188
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:02,632
Did you kill Ushio Kofune
and create her shadow?

189
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:09,764
Oh. Big Sis Ushio, huh.

190
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,475
Yes. I killed her.

191
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:15,437
I strangled her to death.

192
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:25,572
Killed her… Why? Why kill Ushio?

193
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:33,079
You kill people and take their places.
What do you want?

194
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:41,296
It's the end.

195
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,216
It'll be done after this summer.

196
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:51,973
We're going home.
Our whole family is going home.

197
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:56,352
What? What are you talking about?

198
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:01,149
Don't be so afraid.

199
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,861
You misunderstand me, Shinpei.

200
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:08,406
My human self was killed by a shadow,

201
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,328
but the shadow made a perfect copy
of my body, mind, and memories.

202
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:18,291
So I am Shiori Kobayakawa.
I was just born again.

203
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,127
Don't lie! You're not Shiori!

204
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:24,756
You killed Shiori and her family!

205
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:34,599
I wish you'd become a shadow soon too.

206
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:36,059
Come with us.

207
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:40,480
Become my big brother, will you?

208
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:58,498
Enough. Talking to a shadow
for too long can confuse you.

209
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,547
D-Damn it!

210
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,424
It was a tough one.

211
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:11,553
How did you kill Asako
and Tatsuo's shadows?

212
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:13,888
The usual way with one strike
using the hammer.

213
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:19,644
If we strike a blow to a fair percentage
of the flat shadow, it is fatal.

214
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:23,857
We don't have enough samples
to prove my sister's theory.

215
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:28,570
It was saying strange things
about its family going home.

216
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:37,996
Copies acting like the same humans?

217
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,707
It said it was reborn.

218
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:44,669
How is a perfect copy different
from the original person?

219
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:48,548
That was a theme in <i>Swamp Man</i>.
Right, Ryunosuke?

220
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,383
What do you think?

221
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:55,096
I told him about the split personality.

222
00:17:56,181 --> 00:18:00,018
Is that right? Nice to meet you.

223
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:04,397
I'm Ryunosuke Minakata.
I was Hizuru Minakata's brother.

224
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,235
So, are you the author of your novels?

225
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:14,324
Oh, no, it's my sister.
I'm not a good writer.

226
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:19,787
I come out when she's in an interview,
or when she has to be social.

227
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,333
You've read her books, haven't you?

228
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,084
Well, actually…

229
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,253
He's a nerd. A total Nagumo nerd.

230
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:32,884
Is that right?
That wasn't in the recorder.

231
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,636
I guess she was embarrassed…

232
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,681
What are you doing?

233
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:45,104
Don't get the facts messed up.

234
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:49,442
I am not embarrassed,
and I am not hiding anything.

235
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,195
I just leave out unnecessary information…

236
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:54,030
Ms. Nagumo, your nose is bleeding!

237
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:55,573
You okay?

238
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,992
I'm not okay. You have no vocabulary.

239
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:00,954
<i>Does letting down her hair
bring her back to Hizuru?</i>

240
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:04,374
Don't let the words and the appearance
of shadows affect you, Shinpei Ajiro.

241
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:09,879
They might appear as a friend
or a family member, but don't hesitate.

242
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:13,132
Contemplate about
the sameness of copies and originals

243
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:14,676
after we're finished with everything.

244
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,347
It was too late for the Kobayakawas.

245
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,809
However, there is still time for you.

246
00:19:26,104 --> 00:19:28,690
Can you really kill Mio's shadow?

247
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:35,697
We'll wait outside until it's time.

248
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:40,910
Let's exchange numbers.
Tell me if something unexpected happens.

249
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:46,040
Act the same as you did before
and assess the situation.

250
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,626
You are an observer.

251
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,254
Yes.

252
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:54,549
I'm home!

253
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:57,885
Sorry for being late, Mio…

254
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,432
Welcome home, Shinpei.

255
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,979
N-No way.

256
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:15,194
What is with this onion?
It's making me cry so much!

257
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,531
I can't see anything!

258
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,325
What? Are you cooking?

259
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:26,080
Isn't it obvious? I wanted to
stir-fry some onions and chicken.

260
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:27,832
Oh, be careful!

261
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:32,545
<i>This is strange.
Mio never cooked in the past loops.</i>

262
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,005
Why?

263
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:37,675
You didn't look too well in the morning,

264
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,929
so I thought I'd make something for you.

265
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,641
I see. Thanks.

266
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:49,979
But leave the rest to me.
I don't want to see you cut yourself.

267
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:52,607
Don't worry. I feel fine.

268
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,401
I'll go wash my face!

269
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:59,155
<i>Thank goodness, Mio isn't a shadow…</i>

270
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:02,492
<i>and I can still make curry with this.</i>

271
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,495
<i>She can be so cute.</i>

272
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,248
<i>What am I thinking? Nothing can change.</i>

273
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:13,461
<i>The way I acted already changed
Mio's behavior tonight.</i>

274
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,174
<i>I'll make curry,
and everything will be the same.</i>

275
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,553
<i>Well, aside from Ms. Nagumo and Mr. Nezu
waiting outside, armed and ready,</i>

276
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:24,639
<i>that's different…</i>

277
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,813
<i>but besides killing the shadows,
I need to do exactly the same things.</i>

278
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:36,818
<i>Any changes will affect the others
to change too. It's all connected.</i>

279
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:39,320
<i>The future I've seen becomes useless.</i>

280
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:46,994
Hey, Mio. That was a loud rumble.
Are you really that…

281
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,248
hungry?

282
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:55,002
Yes.

283
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,009
