1
00:00:05,236 --> 00:00:09,490
<i>Narezushi</i> is not too common
on Hitogashima Island.

2
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:17,039
I haven't tried it yet. Have you?

3
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:19,166
Huh?

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,251
<i>This woman…</i>

5
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:22,253
<i>I saw her on the ferry!</i>

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,425
The shadow…

7
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:30,845
<i>It's gone!</i>

8
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:55,369
Amazing. Do you have eyes
behind your head?

9
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,381
Why…

10
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:17,933
<i>I-It can't be. Did she really
defeat a shadow?</i>

11
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:23,898
Nice to meet you, I guess.

12
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:34,491
I lived here as a child,
but I've never had <i>narezushi</i>.

13
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:38,245
I wonder how it tastes.

14
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:41,916
Who are you?

15
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,127
Oh, how rude of me.

16
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:52,885
I'm Ryunosuke Nagumo.

17
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:56,889
Nagu… Huh? Ryunosuke?

18
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:59,516
I came to save you.

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,187
I'm sorry I took so long.

20
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,064
Shinpei Ajiro.

21
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,452
{\an8}Na… Nagumo…

22
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,454
Oh. This way!

23
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:47,833
Wh-What?

24
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:50,502
It's a shadow.

25
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,097
<i>Ushio!</i>

26
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,976
<i>I told it to stay put!</i>

27
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:10,898
Wait. It's too dangerous up there.
Shadows are gathering there.

28
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:15,778
C-Can you tell which are human
and which are shadows?

29
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:22,951
Shadows only wear a lump of flesh
in the shape of a human.

30
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,334
Look at the ground. Their true form is
the flat shadow on the ground.

31
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:34,213
They hate it when people
walk on their shadow.

32
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,634
If you try to step on it,
just the shadow will move.

33
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:44,723
I don't know this for sure…

34
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:48,769
but I think shadows use light
to scan humans and absorb information.

35
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,900
My theory is that they use this
in order to feed.

36
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:58,362
Shadows live by consuming
information about humans.

37
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:02,866
However, they need to directly eat
the flesh for the flavor.

38
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,247
Look. That stain is from
when they ate a human body.

39
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:16,839
We happen to be targeted by these shadows.
This goes for you too.

40
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:22,636
The shadows keep increasing,
no matter how many I take down.

41
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,682
It feels as if they're being controlled.

42
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:30,018
Like they're all moving
towards a single goal.

43
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:34,440
<i>A goal.</i>

44
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:39,653
<i>"In no time, Mother will wake up."</i>

45
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:43,532
What was that light?

46
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:50,956
You can kill shadows
with that gun, right? Ms. Nagumo.

47
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:56,295
That's your name, right?
You're the writer.

48
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,006
Ah… Yes.

49
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:03,135
I knew it! Please help me!

50
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,347
I have a lot I want to ask you
another time. But now…

51
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:11,518
Mio and my friends are up there!

52
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:19,902
Shinpei Ajiro.

53
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,865
Will he really save everyone, Sis?

54
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:33,665
Tokiko!

55
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,376
Shinpei?

56
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:42,466
Thank goodness. Where is everyone?
Where is Mio?

57
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,926
Tokiko…

58
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:50,474
I'm so sorry.

59
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,520
Not this…

60
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,025
I didn't get my hands dirty for this.

61
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:05,739
Tokiko.

62
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,622
Stop. Step back.

63
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,015
It is almost nine.

64
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:39,690
The festival is finished.
I shall bring this final day to an end.

65
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:51,285
<i>On the shrine grounds,
the humid night air…</i>

66
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:54,746
<i>was polluted with the rank odor of blood.</i>

67
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:59,293
<i>A mountain of corpses
of villagers and tourists.</i>

68
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,920
You shall not impede me.

69
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:05,841
<i>One… three…</i>

70
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:10,053
<i>Five… seven… nine…</i>

71
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:12,097
<i>Eleven…</i>

72
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:15,100
<i>I couldn't help but count.</i>

73
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:19,479
<i>Even my frozen brain could do that.</i>

74
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:25,360
<i>And…</i>

75
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,869
Sou!

76
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,495
Mio…

77
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,040
R-Run away.

78
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:40,959
Well, ain't this moving!

79
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:48,091
Sacrificing his life for you.
I sure did love you!

80
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,552
N-No.

81
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:55,724
But you were always the same.
Shinpei this, Shinpei that.

82
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,185
Sou.

83
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:16,828
Mio!

84
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,959
What?

85
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:43,105
Dangerous, isn't it?

86
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:47,818
Interfering with this holy ceremony.

87
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:51,613
So you defeated Mio.

88
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,827
So you're the boss.

89
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:59,955
Wh-Who?

90
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,332
Who are you?

91
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,678
Your right eye.

92
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:19,391
I knew it. The right eye
of your long-deceased mother.

93
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,936
Why do you have the original one?

94
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:28,400
Perhaps it is possible to
reproduce time with that.

95
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:32,028
L-Let go of me!

96
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:36,283
Come on, now. What is this?
Don't struggle.

97
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,285
You're on our team.

98
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:42,998
No! I'm a human! Ushio Kofune!

99
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,459
Idiot. You're no human.

100
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:49,171
Humans don't instantly recover
from broken arms.

101
00:10:55,719 --> 00:11:01,308
In order for the boss to defeat the hero
who can restart from a save point…

102
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:05,312
the only solution is to cut off the power
to the game console.

103
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:13,028
What if a virtual game boss understood
a real concept such as electricity?

104
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:19,201
Watch closely. Shinpei.

105
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:24,873
Watch the moment I cut off the power.

106
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:30,921
No! Let go! I'm not one of you!

107
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:35,258
Shinpei! Take care of Mio!

108
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,552
Mio!

109
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:47,103
M-Mio…

110
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:53,109
Mi…

111
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:57,906
Shinpei.

112
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:01,827
Wait for me.

113
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:03,995
Now…

114
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:05,831
Shinpei.

115
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,082
Go…

116
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,607
No! Mio!

117
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:37,279
Mio! No!

118
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:45,704
Mio!

119
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:50,709
No! Don't touch her! Leave Mio alone!

120
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,836
The last meal.

121
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,132
Please eat to your heart's content.

122
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,182
<i>That massive shadow.</i>

123
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:11,062
<i>Will I get swallowed up into it
just by touching it?</i>

124
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,278
I was the one that was useless, Ryunosuke.

125
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,990
It seems I was too late.

126
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:23,033
Ah.

127
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:34,294
Give your last ounce of strength to me.

128
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:39,758
Mother.

129
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:52,896
Nothingness lies ahead.

130
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:04,741
What is that, Mom?

131
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,243
What is that?

132
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:13,917
Huh? What is that?

133
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:36,606
It seems she ate a thousand humans…

134
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,441
and was revived.

135
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:44,572
Look.

136
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,577
The island shall be swallowed up
by the shadows.

137
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:04,801
Heine.

138
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,268
Ah. Delicious.

139
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,607
This is my ending.

140
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:25,071
S-Sorry…

141
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:33,538
Mio… Everyone…

142
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:42,213
I'm sorry, Shinpei.

143
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:47,927
<i>If I had only believed
that message earlier.</i>

144
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,306
I was too late.

145
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:53,433
Far too late.

146
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:57,187
No!

147
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:03,735
I should have done this back then.

148
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:07,655
Why did I say that?

149
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:13,078
All I had were regrets. Constant regrets.

150
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:18,875
But I have no regrets now. Not yet.

151
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,253
It's not too late yet!

152
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,923
-Ms. Nagumo!
-Ah!

153
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,257
Huh?

154
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:31,596
Shoot me! Kill me!

155
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,058
I can redo this if I die!

156
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,770
Shoot my head!

157
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:48,404
You really say some crazy things.

158
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:52,117
I can return to the 22nd!

159
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:55,078
It's futile.

160
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:59,332
This is my last shot.

161
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,002
Please trust me!

162
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:05,713
I'll just swallow you up too.

163
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,593
You…

164
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:15,140
Dummy!

165
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:23,273
If you really can go back…

166
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:27,527
tell me your name, and I will save you.

167
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,164
<i>Darkness.</i>

168
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,376
<i>All gone. No one is here.</i>

169
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:46,838
<i>Disappeared.</i>

170
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:49,424
<i>This scene…</i>

171
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:55,471
<i>Have I stepped back from myself again?</i>

172
00:17:57,098 --> 00:18:02,562
<i>Stop…</i>

173
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,199
<i>The island…</i>

174
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:19,662
<i>What is that red light?</i>

175
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:22,540
<i>A girl?</i>

176
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:26,878
<i>Our eyes met.</i>

177
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:29,923
<i>Shinpei.</i>

178
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:33,801
Huh? Ushio?

179
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,765
<i>Be careful. There's a limit to the power.</i>

180
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,851
<i>Everyone dies at the summer festival.</i>

181
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:46,231
I can hear you clearly this time.
Ushio! Where are you?

182
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:50,443
You're the only one who can stop them.

183
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:55,698
Take good care of Mio.

184
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:04,499
How's Tokyo? Been to Shibuya? Shibuya!

{\an8}JULY 22

186
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:13,549
Ah. Shinpei?

187
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,096
I'm back.

188
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:22,850
Shinpei?

189
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:27,063
<i>I did it.</i>

190
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:29,732
Did you get chills
from falling in the sea?

191
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,985
-<i>Mio is alive.</i>
-Did you hit something?

192
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,657
Shi-Shinpei?

193
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,159
Thank goodness.

194
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:44,163
I'm okay. Just a little seasick
from the ferry.

195
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,877
<i>My clothes are soaked.</i>

196
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:52,255
<i>Ah. Right.</i>

197
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:58,928
<i>I fell in the sea when I tried to stop
Mio's bike. She had to save me.</i>

198
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:04,517
You look pale.
Let's take a rest after we change at home.

199
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,520
Thank goodness our phones are okay.

200
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:12,483
We can't go to the funeral
all wet like this.

201
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:17,447
<i>Ushio told me that
there was a limit to the power.</i>

202
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:21,701
<i>Step back and look at everything
that has happened.</i>

203
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:31,294
<i>First time was on the ferry.
Second time was after landing.</i>

204
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:34,297
<i>Third time was after I met Mio.</i>

205
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:39,344
<i>The starting point for the loop
is gradually getting later.</i>

206
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:44,307
{\an8}<i>The events that happen before
I wake up become fixed.</i>

207
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,391
{\an8}THIRD TIME

208
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:49,187
{\an8}<i>In other words, there is no way
I won't fall into the sea.</i>

210
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:55,151
<i>If I wake up again,
it will be at a later time.</i>

211
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:58,279
<i>I can't fail endlessly.</i>

212
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:04,577
<i>If the starting point comes
after Mio and the others are killed…</i>

213
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,332
<i>I won't be able to save them,
even if I restart the loop.</i>

214
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,502
<i>Three days.</i>

215
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,547
<i>Three days until the summer festival.</i>

216
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:19,592
<i>Can I really solve this
in just three days?</i>

217
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:22,929
<i>No. What am I saying?</i>

218
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:26,891
<i>You're the only one who can stop them.</i>

219
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:30,353
<i>I will do it.</i>

220
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:51,749
{\an8}JULY 22

221
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,961
Huh?
