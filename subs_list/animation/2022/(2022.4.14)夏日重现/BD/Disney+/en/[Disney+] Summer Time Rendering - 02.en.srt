1
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:16,831
Hurry! Call an ambulance!

2
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:18,541
Ushio.

3
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:25,214
Ushio! Tokiko, go to the school
and bring the AED!

4
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:26,715
It's on the pillar by the entrance!

5
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:27,758
<i>Sou...</i>

6
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:29,051
-Okay!
-Run!

7
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,720
<i>-What is...</i>
-Stay with us!

8
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:32,888
<i>What is everyone doing?</i>

9
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:34,849
Ushio! Open your eyes!

10
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:36,433
Ushio...

11
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:41,522
Please! Come back!

12
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:44,400
Ushio!

13
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:51,448
What?

14
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,497
I'm so sorry!

15
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:02,501
I didn't mean to... I mean...

16
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:05,963
HITOGASHIMA

17
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:08,424
I-I am very sorry!

18
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,260
Are you okay?

19
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:12,720
Huh?

20
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:17,183
It seemed like you had a nightmare.
Was it a bad dream?

21
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,143
Dream?

22
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,567
<i>This woman.</i>

23
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:35,492
Have you ever been shot with a gun?

24
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,286
What?

25
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:39,914
Are you really okay?

26
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:42,374
Ah, actually... never mind.

27
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:46,837
<i>I feel like this woman
has slapped me before.</i>

28
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:51,550
Of course not.
I just dreamed about a movie.

29
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:57,223
July 22nd?

30
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:00,434
What is this?

31
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:05,606
<i>I went to Hiruko with Mio on the 23rd.</i>

32
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:09,235
<i>Mio was killed by another Mio.</i>

33
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:14,114
<i>No. Don't be ridiculous.
That had to be a dream.</i>

34
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:21,247
<i>SWAMPMAN</i>
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO

35
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,208
<i>Ryunosuke Nagumo. </i>Swampman<i>.</i>

36
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:30,673
<i>A horror mystery set in Wakayama.</i>

37
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:37,346
<i>The story is about a young girl
who becomes paranoid</i>

38
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,766
<i>that her family and friends
are being replaced by doppelgangers.</i>

39
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:46,605
<i>I was reading this before I fell asleep.</i>

40
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,899
<i>That's why I had such a bad dream.</i>

41
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,407
Right.

42
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:08,002
{\an8}JULY 22

43
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,472
{\an8}SHADOWS

44
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:53,732
<i>Wait a sec.</i>

45
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:56,026
<i>Calm yourself.</i>

46
00:04:57,778 --> 00:05:01,407
<i>At times like these,
I need to step back from myself</i>

47
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,450
<i>and calm down.</i>

48
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:10,916
<i>I'm home for the first time in two years
because my friend Ushio died.</i>

49
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:15,212
<i>But why does it feel like...</i>

50
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:18,298
<i>I just did the same thing yesterday?</i>

51
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:21,343
Hey!

52
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:24,096
Welcome home, Shinpei!

53
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:26,056
<i>No way.</i>

54
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,058
<i>Deja vu?</i>

55
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:31,520
-Hope you had a nice trip!
-<i>Is that what this is?</i>

56
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,398
Ah!

57
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:38,402
<i>She's even wearing the same panties.</i>

58
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:43,657
Use your brakes!

59
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:45,868
I did!

60
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:47,911
Come on.

61
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,666
That's weird.

62
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:08,932
<i>Everything after that was also a repeat.</i>

63
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:13,645
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

64
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,189
Dad!

65
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,317
Shinpei is back!

66
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,236
<i>Everyone acted exactly like in the dream.</i>

67
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:23,280
<i>Said the same things.</i>

68
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:25,574
Shinpei.

69
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:30,454
{\an8}You're so tall now.

70
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,665
You look a bit thinner.

71
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:45,093
<i>This isn't just deja vu
or a dream come to life</i>.

72
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:49,348
<i>I am reliving July 22nd.</i>

73
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,062
<i>My head hurts like it's splitting apart.
My eyes are having spasms.</i>

74
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,066
<i>What is happening, Ushio?</i>

75
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:05,197
<i>They found ligature marks on Ushio's neck.</i>

76
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:08,617
<i>Marks from someone strangling her.</i>

77
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,422
<i>What really happened to you?</i>

78
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:30,806
Ushio's body...
Dr. Hishigata did the autopsy.

79
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:34,685
Autopsy? That is serious!

80
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:37,271
<i>That flash again.</i>

81
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:40,440
Who was that? No photos in here.

82
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:47,364
<i>That is Shiori Kobayakawa.</i>

83
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,952
<i>The girl whom Ushio sacrificed
her life to save.</i>

84
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:56,873
<i>If I really went back in time,</i>

85
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,460
<i>her family will disappear tomorrow.</i>

86
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,089
<i>And if the same thing keeps happening...</i>

87
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:05,507
Shinpei!

88
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,969
You finally came back!

89
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:12,598
<i>...it would mean the shadow really exists.</i>

90
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,286
Thank you for this meal.

91
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,164
<i>If you see the shadow, you die.</i>

92
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,041
So yummy.

93
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,628
<i>Was Ushio killed by the shadow?</i>

94
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:45,172
<i>And Mio...</i>

95
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:48,967
Shinpei?

96
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,473
You look pale.

97
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:58,143
Sorry. I'm going to get some fresh air.

98
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:09,154
<i>This morning,
the brakes on Mio's bicycle were broken.</i>

99
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:14,785
<i>It seemed like someone cut
them intentionally.</i>

100
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,708
<i>If someone deliberately did that...</i>

101
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:29,257
<i>they were trying to kill Mio.</i>

102
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,135
<i>I can't...</i>

103
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:36,181
<i>I can't step back from myself.
I'm so confused.</i>

104
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:38,433
<i>I feel sick.</i>

105
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,560
Huh? What's that?

106
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:41,978
<i>Totsumura?</i>

107
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:43,522
What are you up to, Mio?

108
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:49,111
Staring at your own house.
You get into a fight with someone?

109
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:55,575
<i>Mio?</i>

110
00:09:56,535 --> 00:10:01,039
<i>What is she doing outside
in her school uniform?</i>

111
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:12,884
<i>No.</i>

112
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:15,345
<i>No.</i>

113
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,305
<i>No.</i>

114
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,141
<i>No.</i>

115
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:20,350
<i>No.</i>

116
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:21,601
<i>No.</i>

117
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,729
<i>No. No! No! No!</i>

118
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:28,650
<i>That's not Mio!</i>

119
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,069
<i>It's a shadow!</i>

120
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,037
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

121
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:26,458
<i>A shadow?</i>

122
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:29,461
All right then.

123
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,643
You are now the police officer
Tetsu Totsumura.

124
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:56,196
I am Tetsu Totsumura. 34 years old.
No girlfriend. No promotion in sight.

125
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,156
That's none of your business!

126
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,993
Mio. Looking cute as usual!

127
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,245
Give me your gun.

128
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:07,082
What? You haven't switched places yet?

129
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:09,167
I failed this morning.

130
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:14,047
It would have been easy
if she had been hospitalized.

131
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:17,467
{\an8}It's unlike you to go through
all that trouble!

132
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:22,222
Go take care of it now! You've got a gun.

133
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:26,726
A gunshot on a quiet night like this
would create a scene.

134
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,145
This isn't America.

135
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:30,772
Fair enough.

136
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:36,152
I'm just checking things out today.

137
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:48,748
<i>No way. Is this real?</i>

138
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:50,876
<i>My phone.</i>

139
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:52,711
SOU HISHIGATA

140
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:55,213
<i>Sou! Not now!</i>

141
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:57,674
Damn!

142
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,435
So this is where you were, Shinpei.

143
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:16,234
Eavesdropping ain't polite, Shinpei.
You get the death penalty.

144
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:18,111
You want to copy him, too?

145
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,033
No. He is...

146
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:27,120
<i>Is this my blood?</i>

147
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:33,668
<i>So red... Oh, I'm dying.</i>

148
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:38,798
<i>I can finally step back from myself.</i>

149
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:42,844
<i>What?</i>

150
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:47,891
<i>What is this?</i>

151
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:51,770
Shinpei.

152
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:52,938
Who is that?

153
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:54,898
Be careful...

154
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:01,655
What? I can't hear you!

155
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:02,739
Shin.

156
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,869
Take good care of Mio.

157
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:29,057
{\an8}JULY 22

158
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,935
{\an8}JULY 22

159
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,812
{\an8}<i>I'm back, again.</i>

160
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:40,443
<i>Did I die?</i>

161
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:44,698
<i>Why did I come back?</i>

162
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,869
Hey! Welcome home, Shinpei!

163
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:53,790
<i>Step back from myself.</i>

164
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,002
<i>You heard it.</i>

165
00:14:57,585 --> 00:14:58,712
<i>Ushio's voice.</i>

166
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:01,172
<i>She asked me.</i>

167
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:03,633
<i>To take good care of Mio!</i>

168
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:06,094
Ah! I can't stop!

169
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,055
Leave it to me!

170
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,515
Stop!

171
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,144
Crap!

172
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,312
Shinpei!

173
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:19,024
<i>I can't swim.</i>

174
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,121
Shinpei! Breathe!

175
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:36,124
Mio... Are you okay?

176
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,376
Yes.

177
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:41,671
Thank you, Shinpei.

178
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,342
RECORDING

179
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:47,552
It's me.

180
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:50,555
It is July 22nd at 1:02 p.m.

181
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:54,267
I have been in Hitogashima
for 1 hour and 37 minutes.

182
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,854
I ate <i>narezushi</i> before boarding the ship.

183
00:15:58,438 --> 00:15:59,647
<i>Narezushi</i>

184
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:04,027
is a traditional dish made by pickling
mackerel with salt for over a month.

185
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,071
It is quite exquisite.

186
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:10,825
Try it when you come to Wakayama.
I'd love to know what you think.

187
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:16,206
By the way, you asked me why
I hang upside down.

188
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,920
It's because when blood runs to my head,
it helps me think clearly.

189
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:29,803
You should try it.
It'll help that clouded brain of yours.

190
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:35,475
The rest is in the report.

191
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:44,359
They're everywhere. Unthinkable.

192
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:47,821
I'll just observe for now. That's all.

193
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,167
{\an8}<i>GAME PLAYBOY</i>

194
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,628
{\an8}Hello? Ally of justice here.

195
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:07,632
Huh? What?

196
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:09,759
<i>A violent outburst?</i>

197
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:10,844
Yes.

198
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:12,512
<i>Is this Shinpei speaking?</i>

199
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:14,806
-Yes.
-<i>Are you okay?</i>

200
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:17,016
-Yes. By the shopping area.
-<i>Shopping area?</i>

201
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:19,561
-It's a customer at the bar.
-<i>Oh, the bar?</i>

202
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:21,271
Please help!

203
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,738
<i>Step back from myself
and think about what I need to do.</i>

204
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:34,701
<i>I just have to survive today.</i>

205
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:41,624
Do you think I'd be in trouble?

206
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,671
The fake report would keep Totsumura
away from here.

207
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:51,009
He'd be a little pissed that it was fake,

208
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:54,846
but the important thing is
that he is safe, right?

209
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,182
<i>For Sou,</i>

210
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,475
<i>I texted that I would call him tomorrow.</i>

211
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,481
<i>I'll also erase unnecessary apps
and photos.</i>

212
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:09,861
<i>Now I have seven gigabytes of storage.</i>

213
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:12,322
<i>Plenty of space to record video.</i>

214
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:17,118
<i>Turn on airplane mode to silence
incoming calls. Fully charge the phone.</i>

215
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:19,287
<i>I'll connect my mobile battery, too.</i>

216
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,668
<i>Thankfully, I know what time it will come.</i>

217
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,504
<i>Begin recording.</i>

218
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:34,969
<i>I'll film Mio's shadow and get proof.</i>

219
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:41,476
<i>I won't go outside,
no matter how sick I feel.</i>

220
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,102
<i>Then I'll be okay.</i>

221
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:49,525
<i>I wasn't killed on the 22nd
the first time around.</i>

222
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:55,615
<i>The color of my right eye is different.</i>

223
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:57,450
<i>Since when?</i>

224
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,296
Mio is in there, right?

225
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:14,676
Mio...

226
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,728
Mio!

227
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:34,112
Jerk!

228
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:35,822
<i>-Step back from myself...</i>
-You pervert!

229
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:38,074
-What were you looking at, Shinpei?
-Sorry.

230
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:41,035
<i>Mio is safe. Good!</i>

231
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,620
What was that?

232
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:56,426
Perfect.

233
00:19:57,385 --> 00:20:00,179
{\an8}I totally got it on video.

234
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:02,807
{\an8}JULY 23

235
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:10,940
Good morning, Shinpei.

236
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:12,984
Mio. Can we talk?

237
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:22,410
It showed up in front of our house
last night at nine.

238
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:27,415
{\an8}It looked upstairs for five minutes,
then walked into the mountains.

239
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:34,297
Who is this? Me?

240
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,593
No. You were taking a bath at this time.

241
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:44,140
They call it a shadow.

242
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,563
Mio, you've heard of
the shadow sickness, right?

243
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,816
It came here...

244
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,777
to kill you.

245
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:59,238
I came to kill myself?

246
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:02,283
Zoom in to the hand.

247
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,204
It can't be.

248
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:12,085
So the shadow sickness wasn't
a superstition. I knew it.

249
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:16,547
Ushio also saw a shadow, right?

250
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,842
Three days before she died.

251
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:26,516
Right. I guess she told you
about the shadow.

252
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,977
<i>Well, I actually heard it from you.</i>

253
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:35,983
And I saw it too.
I saw your shadow... yesterday.

254
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,742
Hey, Shinpei.

255
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,456
My sister may have been killed...

256
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,749
by a shadow.

257
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,051
