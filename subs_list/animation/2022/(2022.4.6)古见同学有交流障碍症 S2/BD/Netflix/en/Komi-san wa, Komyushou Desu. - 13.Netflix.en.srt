00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,496
He sat down!

181
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,457
<i>Deep breaths, deep breaths!</i>

182
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,417
EXHALE

183
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,424
-<i>She's still staring!</i>
-TOO SCARED TO MOVE

184
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,095
<i>Everyone usually looks away</i>
<i>when I meet their gaze.</i>

185
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:24,266
<i>But this might be the first time</i>
<i>someone looked me in the eyes.</i>

186
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,060
<i>Oh, right!</i>

187
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,271
Even Monkeys Can Talk <i>chapter 4, page 116!</i>

188
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,566
<i>"Get your feelings across</i>
<i>by looking people in the eyes!"</i>

189
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,778
<i>That's why this person</i>
<i>is looking me in the eyes!</i>

190
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,615
<i>It means she wants to communicate, right?</i>

191
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,618
<i>Okay! I can do it too!</i>

192
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,999
-They're glaring at each other.
-It's a stare-down!

193
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,460
SCARED

194
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:53,921
SCARED

195
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:54,839
TREMBLE

196
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,048
Uh.

197
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,218
Um, you're Katai. Aren't you?

198
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,636
Huh?

199
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,680
<i>Aaah! No!</i>

200
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,224
<i>My voice changed and now it's super low.</i>

201
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:09,353
<i>If I don't make it higher,</i>
<i>I sound like I'm really mad!</i>

202
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,691
<i>Now he thinks I'm a jerk.</i>

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,820
You were out of school
for a long time, right?

204
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,282
If you want, I can show you around!

205
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,408
Huh?

206
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,750
I'd… like that.

207
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,514
This is the music room.

208
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,765
<i>W-Wow.</i>

209
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,810
-<i>This is the power of eye contact.</i>
-STARE

210
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,270
-Here is the library.
-LIBRARY

211
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,983
<i>Walking through the school,</i>
<i>just the two of us.</i>

212
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,860
<i>We're like real friends!</i>

00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,111
-GRIN
-SQUEAL

214
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,988
Are you listening?

215
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,198
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

216
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,577
<i>She was staring in order to tell me.</i>

217
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,038
The Master of Communication.

218
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:15,002
She's Commu, the Master of Communication!

219
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,253
<i>Go get 'em!</i>

220
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,463
Commu?

221
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,132
COMMU

222
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,175
-Bang!
-COMMUNICATION SKILLS

223
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,888
MISSION 46
"IT'S JUST STUDYING AT NAKANAKA'S."

224
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,099
That's all everyone. See you tomorrow.

225
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,060
Let's go out for ramen.

226
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,311
Sounds good!

227
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,523
-It's winter!
-A SNOWMAN POSE

228
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,775
Maybe I just won't ask.

229
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,111
I thought you hated winter.

230
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,488
I can't stand the cold.

231
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,616
But there are lots of fun winter events.

232
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,954
Christmas, gift money, skiing,
cozy rooms, the Ekiden race! And…

233
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,164
Term finals!

234
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,334
-Tests. You're always the same.
-TERM FINALS

235
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,504
Standing between me and my fun.

236
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,130
How dare you!

237
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,843
Oh yeah! We can study at Nakanaka's house!

238
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,055
<i>They just want to play games.</i>

239
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,306
NAKANAKA RESIDENCE

240
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,519
Anyway… You are welcome at my castle.

241
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,979
But what's up with her?

242
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:19,149
Who's she talking about?
We don't know, do we Komi?

243
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,234
It's you! You!

244
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,946
Why? We're friends aren't we, Nakanaka?

245
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,491
<i>Forgetting me and inviting Komi?</i>
<i>Unacceptable!</i>

246
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,952
I don't remember being friends with you.

247
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,413
<i>You're just jealous that Komi came over.</i>

248
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,581
<i>You harlot!</i>

249
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,666
RUMBLE

250
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,628
<i>These two are not very compatible.</i>

251
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,547
Thanks for having me!

252
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,923
Good night!

253
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,633
Asleep!

254
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,802
<i>What was the point of this visit?</i>

255
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,554
So, Komi.

256
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,099
Sit next to me.

257
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,894
There's a physics formula
I don't understand..

258
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,062
N-No! You should sit here.

259
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,898
That cushion is of poor quality!

260
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,027
<i>This is how Yamai and Nakanaka</i>

261
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,572
<i>sparked off their battle for Komi's heart.</i>

262
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,782
WILD GIRLS
BEAST EARS, THE MOVIE

263
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,999
I know, Komi! Want to play a game?

264
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,459
Last time was hard, right?

265
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,170
I've gathered some games
with easier controls.

266
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,174
<i>Nakanaka's attack:</i>
<i>"For Komi's Benefit."</i>

267
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,801
<i>I thought we came to study…</i>

268
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,929
Of course she doesn't want to play.

269
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,680
-That's such a boyish activity.
-HEH

270
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,391
-What?
-<i>But it was blocked!</i>

271
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,226
Girls like romance!

272
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,145
Komi, who's your crush?

273
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,521
Mine is you.

274
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,231
<i>"Practically a Confession!"</i>

275
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,485
YAMAI'S ATTACK: PRACTICALLY A CONFESSION!

276
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,487
<i>It's not very effective…</i>

277
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,197
Um, what about studying?

278
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,661
That reminds me…

279
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,956
I noticed when I entered this room.

280
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,543
The whole interior is black and you have
so many anime and movie posters.

281
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,505
It's like an otaku boy's room.

282
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,589
Urgh!

283
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,007
<i>It's super effective!</i>

284
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,884
Alright then.

285
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,054
What do you consider a girly room?

286
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,722
That's easy.

287
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,224
You need a big mirror.

288
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,644
Make-up, perfume, pink items,
antique-style furniture.

289
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,854
And serve jasmine tea, not barley…

290
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,816
How basic.

291
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,151
<i>It's super effective!</i>

292
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,822
Your nails are filthy!
I'm not interested in your opinion.

293
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,449
You're the one with damaged hair!

294
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,535
Since you change the color often.

295
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,454
You live at home,
so I bet you can't even cook!

296
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,914
So unfeminine.

297
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,165
-Femininity!
-GIRLS ARE SCARY.

298
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,210
Don't judge me on something
you can't even quantify!

299
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,547
According to our star charts,
I'm a better match for Komi!

300
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,424
There you go being basic again!

301
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,092
There's no evidence!

302
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,428
Why do you talk like that?

303
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,514
You do it because
you're an internet addict, right?

304
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,517
You're as good at
finding information as my mom!

305
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,228
-How old did you say you were?
-<i>Komi is…</i>

306
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,479
-Let's calm down…
-Huh?!

307
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,856
Oh, nothing.

308
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,067
Komi, which of us is a better friend?

309
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,320
<i>And now the spears point at Komi.</i>

310
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,958
YOU'RE BOTH IMPORTANT TO ME.

311
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,178
-SECRETLY HAPPY
-FIDGETY

312
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,597
Y-Yeah, but!

313
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,433
If you had to choose, who would it be?

314
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,145
Why not see who gets a higher test score?

315
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,480
Shut up.

316
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,648
<i>They're in perfect sync.</i>

317
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,361
<i>We can't keep asking Komi.</i>

318
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>She'll hate me if I'm aggressive.</i>

319
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,824
<i>Have you ever not been aggressive?</i>

320
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,788
Isn't there something?
Some way to settle this?

321
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,331
Games.

322
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,085
We have video games!

323
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,881
Yeah.

324
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,300
Let's do it!

325
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,761
-Games!
-Me too!

326
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,890
Hang on! Don't put a banana there!

327
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,894
-I'll let my strategy speak for itself!
-Yes, that's it!

328
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,396
Scoundrel! You're aiming
that red carapace at me!

329
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,857
Must be your imagination!

330
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,567
Take that!

331
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,028
The R button on the right…

332
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,281
Take that! And that!

333
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,242
Boom!

334
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,702
Finish!

335
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,164
Yay! I win!

336
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,668
That means Komi's best friend is me!

337
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,419
BANG

338
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,173
<i>Najimi, why do you have to be like that?</i>

339
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,801
<i>They competed on their tests too.</i>

340
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,886
A draw?!

341
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,848
You've all cleared your desks, right?

342
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,891
You've got your writing tools?

343
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,811
If you drop anything
I'll get it, so let me know.

344
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,855
Now, start!

345
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,544
WOBBLE

346
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,216
POP

347
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,430
<i>Komi only prepared two pencils.</i>

348
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:50,522
HAS TO SAY SHE DROPPED HER PENCIL…

349
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,401
<i>Komi is too shy about standing out</i>
<i>so she can't say it.</i>

350
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,366
<i>Huh? Komi's…</i>

351
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,243
<i>not writing…?</i>

352
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,828
PLOP

353
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

354
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,920
<i>Around there.</i>

355
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,259
Teacher? I dropped my mechanical pencil.

356
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,137
-Huh?
