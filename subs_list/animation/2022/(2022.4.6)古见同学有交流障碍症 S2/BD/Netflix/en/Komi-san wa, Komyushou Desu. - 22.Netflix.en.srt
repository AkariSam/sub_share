00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,806
Yes. You may thank me.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,062
Get your cringey Chrysanthemum

Alright, see you later.

Good morning, Komi.

Okay. Want to come over

I make treats for my family every year.

63
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,055

It's because she's shy.
Don't pester her too much!

133
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,511
Shaa?

134
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,678
Not shaa.

Yay! Thank you!

186
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,655
Just a single Chirori Choco
and my investment pays off big-time!

187
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,700
It's a great day, Valentine's.

188
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,952
INCORRIGIBLE…

189
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,995
Komi, good morning!

190
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,038
<i>She's here…!</i>

191
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,794
I made some chocolates just for you!

192
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,421
Take them!

193
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,922
OMINOUS

194
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,676
Yeah, eat it. Eat my face…

195
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,720
Lick me, suck me, eat me…

196
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,434
And then I'll be a part of you forever…

197
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,060
SLIDES

198
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,831
Y-Yamai?!

199
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,791
Hey, Yamai! Are you okay?

200
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,210
<i>Everyone's excited for Valentine's Day.</i>

201
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>Letting themselves be manipulated</i>
<i>by an event created by a corporation.</i>

202
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,924
<i>Fools, all of them.</i>

203
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,510
<i>For me, it's just another day.</i>

204
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,971
<i>Watch me behave as if nothing has changed!</i>

205
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,974
<i>Admire my normalcy. Bow to…</i>

206
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,728
SUPER HAPPY

207
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,731
T-Thank you very much!

208
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,733
MAKERU'S VS. KOMI'S CHOCOLATES

209
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,861
Sorry about yesterday.
Take this as an apology.

210
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,281
Are you giving
true love chocolate to anyone?

211
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,870
<i>Makoto Katai has come to school.</i>

212
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,456
<i>Today is Valentine's Day.</i>

213
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:17,463
<i>These days, even boys give each other</i>
<i>so-called "rival chocolate."</i>

214
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,803
<i>I-I did bring some chocolates</i>
<i>but I'm too shy to go first.</i>

215
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,015
<i>I-I wonder if Tadano has something for me?</i>

216
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,225
He's in deep.

217
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,727
Chiarai, here.

218
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,938
So you know, it's just obligatory.

219
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,065
I expect triple on White Day!

220
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,316
Oh! Thank you!

221
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,069
Y-You should act happier!

222
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,446
Don't move.

223
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,990
The thing at your back is the real thing.

224
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,575
S-Stop.

225
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,583
BULLET-SHAPED CHOCOLATE

226
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,670
<i>The real thing.</i>

227
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,923
Hm? Valentine's Day?

228
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,091
What's that?

229
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,886
-I don't… need anything…
-Chocolates? To someone you like?

230
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,179
Wow.

231
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,684
I have some brown sugar treats. Want some?

232
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,857
<i>All fantasies.</i>

233
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,483
Katai!

234
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,195
<i>Sasaki! Are you trying to die?</i>

235
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,072
Go on, go!

236
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,367
N-No! Everyone's looking!

237
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,494
-I already called him.
-KATAI IS SCARED

238
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,039
Um, uh. Here.

239
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,750
Y-You don't have to give me anything back.

240
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,503
W-What?!

241
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,134
-That's his response?!
-PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T GET ANY

242
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,762
<i>What is this package? I'm scared!</i>

243
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,267
-<i>So cool…</i>
-<i>My mentor has chocolates? Why?</i>

244
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,021
<i>What does this mean?</i>

245
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,647
DIDN'T GET CHOCOLATE FROM KOMI

246
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,858
<i>Yes, I shouldn't wait.</i>

247
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,651
<i>I should be proactive!</i>

248
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,486
-<i>You are so right!</i>
-MENTOR IN HIS HEART

249
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
<i>You can do it!</i>

250
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:11,035
DIDN'T GET CHOCOLATES FROM KOMI

251
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,083
Are you giving chocolates
to all your friends?

252
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,961
I-I see.

253
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,302
AFTER SCHOOL

254
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,809
I-It's rival chocolate.

255
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,980
Thanks Katai.

256
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,025
I don't have anything for you now.

257
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,069
I'll get you something on White Day.

258
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,198
<i>Whi… That's like true love chocolate!</i>

259
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,201
KOMI COULDN'T GIVE CHOCOLATE TO TADANO.

260
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,960
PEBBLE

261
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,299
<i>On that day, Tadano was unconcerned.</i>

262
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,427
-I don't expect true love chocolates.
-THIS MORNING: HITOHITO TADANO (17)

263
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,848
But I'll get some friend chocolates from
my female friends, for sure.

264
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:19,311
<i>Yes! Normally, Tadano is careful</i>
<i>not to get too confident,</i>

265
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,688
<i>but look at him.</i>

266
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,690
<i>Valentine magic!</i>

267
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,442
<i>But in reality…</i>

268
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,366
<i>Zero. Zero chocolates.</i>

269
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,619
<i>This number does not include</i>
<i>chocolates from boys.</i>

270
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,705
<i>Sorry Katai, but that's how it is.</i>

271
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,541
<i>Komi was a given,</i>
<i>but even Onemine and Otori.</i>

272
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,377
<i>Nothing from the girls he's friends with.</i>

273
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,380
<i>Unpopular! Tadano's unpopular!</i>

274
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,757
Oh, you're back.

275
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,175
Get any chocolates?

276
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,802
Hey!

277
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,928
<i>Zero chocolates.</i>

278
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,307
<i>The truth of this was enough stress</i>
<i>to bring Tadano to his knees.</i>

279
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,601
I didn't think you were the type?

280
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,562
Honey, what are you doing?

281
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,938
Here's your chocolate.

282
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,275
<i>Chocolates from Mom doesn't count!</i>

283
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,194
<i>Also, Tadano's mom calls him Honey!</i>

284
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,866
Hey, cheer up.

285
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,577
Mom and I both gave you chocolates.

286
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,246
You got some
from your friend too, didn't you?

287
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,916
From… a boy…

288
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,173
He got chocolates from a boy.

289
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:33,343
Really? I don't know him,
but he must be a nice boy.

290
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,931
BZZZT

291
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,434
Hey, go buy some ice cream.

292
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,270
Huh? No way. What a pain.

293
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,938
It's cold out. Why ice cr--

294
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,231
Just do it.

295
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,109
Winter is a popular season for ice cream.

296
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,112
It's warm inside
so people crave ice cream.

297
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,656
Sales figures are rising every year.

298
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
-Winter ice cream is a thing.
-What?

299
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,952
TADANO GRUMBLED BUT DECIDED TO GO.

300
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,458
Ooh it's cold.

301
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,126
BUMP

302
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,885
Komi?

303
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,596
-Some bouillon too, Honey.
-DOESN'T WANT KOMI TO HEAR

304
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,223
Oh, bouillon? Okay!

305
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,101
L-Let's go to the park!

306
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,487
Are you okay where I hit you
with the door?

307
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,784
Oh, good. Sorry.

308
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,704
Anyway, what's up?

309
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,998
Today, uh.

310
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,377
<i>Chocolates? Is it chocolates?</i>

311
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,881
MEETING NOTES
FOR GARBAGE COLLECTION

312
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,761
What's this?

313
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,389
"We had a student council meeting today.

314
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,768
Najimi said to give this to you,
since you didn't come."

315
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,021
-Oh no! Thanks for bringing it to me.
-WHY DIDN'T YOU COME?

316
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,440
-BYE THEN.
-BOW

317
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,525
You're leaving?

318
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,485
Uh, take care!

319
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,751
<i>I don't know what I was expecting.</i>

320
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,504
<i>It's perfectly normal to not get anything.</i>

321
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,386
<i>It's Komi's choice whether</i>
<i>she gives some to me or not.</i>

322
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,472
<i>Yeah! I expected too much!</i>

323
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,017
<i>What am I doing?</i>

324
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,271
<i>Even so…</i>

325
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:59,656
<i>I hope she doesn't hate me…</i>

326
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,090
Ta… Tadano!

327
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,224
Uh, yes?

328
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,523
Yes?

329
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,333
H-Here…

330
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,758
I-It's friend chocolate.

331
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,969
Oh, okay!

332
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,763
Of course! Of course it is!

333
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,520
FOR TADANO

334
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,527
I'm embarrassed to say, but…

335
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,740
All day I've been wondering
if I'd get some chocolates.

336
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,286
You gave some
to all of your friends after all.

337
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:32,457
But I didn't get any, and I gave up…

338
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,668
Um…

339
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,379
What am I trying to say?

340
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,132
Anyway!

341
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:46,722
Getting chocolates from you
makes me feel much…

342
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,226
happier than I imagined!

343
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,231
FLAP FLAP

344
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,071
T-Those chocolates…

345
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,866
T-They're the ones that…

346
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,995
t-turned out best.

347
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,665
Aw, you didn't have to.
Thank you very much!

348
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,712

S-Suddenly? Komi?

352
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,636
I-It's dark! I'll walk you home!
