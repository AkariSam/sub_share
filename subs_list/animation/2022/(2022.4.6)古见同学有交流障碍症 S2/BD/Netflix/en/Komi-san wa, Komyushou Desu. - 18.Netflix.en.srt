<i>It's a new year. January 2.</i>

2
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,725
You're sleeping the day away!

3
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,059
It's already noon.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,269
Shut up.

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,566
Huh? Hang on. Why are you here?

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,942
Huh?

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,998
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

8
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>they struggle to communicate with others.</i>

9
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>Bear in mind,</i>

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,133
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

11
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>It doesn't mean they don't want to.</i>

12
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,192
C'mon now.

13
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,778
Did you forget why I'm here?

14
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,614
We were up late last night playing games.

15
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,075
Oh, were we?

16
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,702
Yes, we were, Tadano!

17
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:46,374
New Year's means going to the shrine!
Yes, let's go to the shrine!

18
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,751
I'm eating lunch now, so wait.

19
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,962
-Stare…
-Don't watch me.

20
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,175
So we'll invite everyone
and we'll all swarm the shrine!

21
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,635
There's street stalls too!

22
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,637
They've probably already gone.

23
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,473
It doesn't matter
how many times we go. It's fun!

24
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,767
-Hello, Komi?
-That was fast.

25
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,102
Do you have time now?

26
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,981
Yes, yes, everyone's going to the shrine.

27
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,482
Yeah! Ha-ha!

28
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,068
Okay. See you at six! Bye!

29
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,361
Couldn't get through.

30
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,530
Huh? What was that performance for?

31
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,490
YAMAI'S NEW YEAR'S

32
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,452
NAJIMI

33
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,580
Hello?

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,499
<i>Hi, Yamai. Let's go to the shrine!</i>

35
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,461
Ah-ha, Najimi. Sorry.

36
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,838
I'm in Hawaii right now.

37
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,506
Truly sorry.

38
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,050
She's so obnoxious!

39
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,718
Oh yeah? Too bad!

40
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,511
-Since Komi's coming.
-A LIE.

41
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,015
Now, who should I call next?

42
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,935
I think you did the right thing.

43
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,895
NAKANAKA'S NEW YEAR'S

46
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,402

47
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,738
<i>Here we go! Only 30 seconds left!</i>

48
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,323
<i>It'll be a close call!</i>

49
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>I'm in the zone!</i>

50
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:03,826
NAJIMI

51
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,246
Nakanaka said she will come.

52
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,830
R-Really?

53
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,792
-AGARI'S NEW YEAR'S
-How many mochi is that?

54
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,293
Hm?

55

NAJIMI

56
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,090
AGARI IS CHOKING ON MOCHI.

57
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,550
Agari?

Hello? This is Makeru Yadano's brother.

66
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,864
She's busy being a sore loser.

67
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,242
Oh, I think she can go to the shrine.

68
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,744
<i>Everyone's timing is so bad!</i>

69
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,497
Not fair making me do all the work!

70
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,499
Tadano, you call someone!

71
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,751
You're the one who wanted to go.

72
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,961
I'll do it though.

73
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,258
-Hi! This is Kazuya Onemine, age five!
-ONEMINE'S NEW YEAR'S

<i>Little twerp!</i>

00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,513
<i>Don't answer my phone! I already told you!</i>

77
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,515
<i>Ow!</i>

78
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,434
Tadano?

79
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,104
Uh, um. Do you want to go
with us to the shrine today?

80
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,481
The shrine? Yeah!

81
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,858
Shut up!

82
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,326
Spade!

83
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,618
So long…

84
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:34,125
Hello? This is Otori.

85
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,460
Oh, Otori?

86
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,255
We're all planning on going
to the shrine today.

87
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,884
Ah, that sounds nice.

88
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,890
Huh? Is it already the new year?

89
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,683
Hm? Yes.

90
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,644
Oh, I see.

91
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,735
I've been watching the
fireplace video since Christmas.

94
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,701
I can't leave him out.

95
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,620
-I'll allow it.
-Hm.

96
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,704

Yup!

You've got it in you! Go! Go!

108
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,736
<i>W-Who's that girl?</i>

109
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,698
<i>She's keeping pace with the runners!</i>
<i>For over fifteen minutes!</i>

110
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,285
<i>The popular,</i>
<i>life-loving group's New Year's.</i>

111
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,080
They're just at Wac, eating or whatever.

112
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,289
They'll come.

113
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,293
Is that really loving life?

114
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,129
I'm bored.

115
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,298
Alright! We've called nearly everyone!

116
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,468
-I could call 4,000 more people.
-No!

117
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,146
M-Maybe we should
try calling Komi one more time.

118
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,397
GRIN

119
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,399

-Everyone will be expecting her!
-THOUSAND-ARMED TADANO

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,530
And anyway, if Yamai comes
all the way from Hawaii,

122
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,115
she'll find out you lied.

123
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,117
I'm not saying you shouldn't.

124
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,926
Hurry and call!

125
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,428
-KOMI
-A call!

126
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,846
It's from Komi!

127
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,724
Hello hello! Sorry you had to call back.

128
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,976
Oh, you were in a tunnel! I see.

129
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,229
-Are you embarrassed?
-We're going to the shrine.

130
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,565
Yeah. See ya!

131
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,403
<i>I-Insufferable.</i>

132
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,906
Everyone's here!

133
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,493
Now then… we're off!

134
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,120
To the shrine!

135
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,247
It's not that kind of event.

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,169
Oh. Happy New Year.

137
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,881
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

138
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,798
Yeah.

139
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,968
Shall we head up?

140
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:39,727
RESTLESS

141
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,689
Do you want to run too?

142
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,365
<i>Off to the shrine.</i>

143
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,953
Tadano, let's get fortunes!

144
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,205
After we've paid our respects.

145
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,165
-Let's go big luck!
-SMALL LUCK

146

<i>Small luck.</i>

147
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,502
How is everyone else's?

148
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,046
This is my first fortune ever!

149
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,673
Komi, how is yours?

150
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,724
Why are you hiding it?

151
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,478
Komi? Um. Show me.

152
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,604
What?

153
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,608
KOMI'S FORTUNE
BIG LUCK

154
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,569
It's perfect.

-Your grinning is gross.

157
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,700
It's perfect!

158
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,410
EARLY TO BED, EARLY TO RISE

159
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,621
<i>Alright, I'm going to invite Tadano!</i>

160
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,373
The way you're sitting is gross.

161
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,793
<i>When we went to the shrine the other day,</i>

162
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,046
<i>I didn't really get to talk to Tadano.</i>

163
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,592
<i>That's the only time</i>
<i>I've gone out all break.</i>

164
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,176
<i>It's not healthy.</i>

165
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,637
<i>I do like staying home, but…</i>

166
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,640
<i>Alright, I'm going to invite Tadano out!</i>

167
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:00,975
TADANO

168
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,893
I-I did it!

169
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,979
Hello?

170
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,023
He answered!

171
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,442
Uh, I have to say my name.

172
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,446
Oh, but it's so embarrassing
to say my own name.

173
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,824
But I have to say something.
What else can I say?

174
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,327
-It's me.
-<i>The "it's me" phone scam?</i>

175
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,039
Um, Katai? What's up?

176
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,915
I have to say why I called!

177
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,336
First, I should ask
if he has time to talk.

178
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,297
-Hey Tadano. You have time to talk?
-IDEAL

179
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,675
-<i>I'm so nervous!</i>
-REALITY

00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,846
<i>Uh… Can I…</i>

181
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,431
<i>do it?</i>

182
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,141
D-do what?

183
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,895
-<i>Uh, you know… Let's uh…</i>
-KATAI'S ASKING IF IT'S ALRIGHT TO CALL.

184
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,855
-<i>Do it together?</i>
-KATAI'S INVITING HIM SKATING.

185
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,398
K-Katai?!

186
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,109
KATAI EXPLAINS EVERYTHING

187
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,613
Oh, I see. Ice skating! Sure!

188
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,199
<i>Tadano!</i>

189
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,036
Can I invite some other people?
If you don't mind.

190
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,580
Oh. Of course.

191
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,916
I did want it to be just us two!

192
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,045
But this'll be a good opportunity
to make more male friends.

193
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,672
Alright! I can do it!

194
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
Morning, Katai!

195
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,102
<i>Mentor!</i>

196
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,104
I invited Najimi too,

197
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,440
but they were already quadruple-booked.

198
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,152
-<i>Of all people! My mentor!</i>
-SCARED OF EACH OTHER

199
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,156
You ate lunch with Komi before,
so I figured it would be okay.

200
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,617
<i>Ah! That's right.</i>

201
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,495
<i>My mentor came because</i>
<i>she was worried about me!</i>

202
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,747
We're probably in the way here.

203
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,124
-Shall we go?
-<i>Okay!</i>

204
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,376
<i>I've got the perfect date plan.</i>

205
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,711
-<i>I'll show my mentor!</i>
-Katai? We're going!

206
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,386
<i>W-What kind of group is that?</i>

207
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,638
We've arrived.

208
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,979
<i>Alright!</i>

209
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,274
<i>I'll elegantly escort Tadano!</i>

210
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,988
Come with me.

211
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,869
Come with me.

212
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,207
<i>Oh no!</i>

213
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,919
<i>I've never gone ice skating before!</i>

214
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,255
<i>His perfect date plan broke down.</i>

215
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,718
K-Katai.

216
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,429
You've never gone ice skating?

217
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,431
I'm sor- uh, my bad.

218
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,476
Komi, do you have experience skating?

219
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,107
Is that right!

220
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,195
Well, let's start by
practicing at the wall.

221
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,322
KNOWS HOW TO SKATE

222
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,073
H-He's so cool!

223
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,746
First, put your hand on the wall
and practice walking.

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,708
Ah, a little lower.

225
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,836
Keep your center of gravity
over your ankles and knees.

226
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,423
If you walk like that,
you'll keep moving forward.

227
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,425
And you'll start skating.

228
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,970
Komi!

229
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,230
It's alright. I'll teach you
how to stop now.

230
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,943
Move one foot
in front a little, like this.

231
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,528
Very good!

232
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,239
Don't put it too far ahead.

233
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,825
If you do, you'll spin around…

234
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,415
Katai! How are you doing?!

235
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,671
<i>Oh, I see. Those two are…</i>

236
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,424
<i>Now I understand.</i>

237
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:08,722
<i>If he teaches me and we hold hands,</i>
<i>we'll grow closer as friends, Mentor!</i>

238
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,016
<i>A-Alright!</i>

239
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,020
<i>I'll hold hands with Tadano and skate too!</i>

240
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,607
Katai's working hard.

241
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,996
Oof.

242
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,499
Are you alright, Katai?

243
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,964
Yeah.

244
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,499
Yeah! I skated, Tadano!

245
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,440
MISSION 63
"IT'S JUST A COLD."

246
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,901
Are you really alright?

247
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,362
I'm worried.

248
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,865
I'm okay. I just have a little fever.

249
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
You'll be back tonight, right? Have fun.

250
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,870
Okay.

251
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,082
I'll buy you a souvenir
at the hot spring. Don't die!

252
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,625
I won't die.

253
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,418
See you later!

254
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,228
<i>It's worse than I thought.</i>

255
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,362
Ugh.

256
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,510
<i>Oh no. I think I might die.</i>

257
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,678
ABOUT TO CRY

258
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,681
-<i>Don't die, don't die, don't die.</i>
-AUDITORY HALLUCINATION

259
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,350
<i>I-I need some water.</i>

260
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,814
<i>Dead!</i>

261
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,566
<i>Death!</i>

262
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,942
<i>No, no, no!</i>

263
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,195
<i>If I can get to the fridge,</i>
<i>there'll be something to drink.</i>

264
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,952
<i>I can't stand! I'm gonna die!</i>

265
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,247
<i>I need someone to rescue me!</i>

266
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,920
<i>Najimi! This is a time for Najimi!</i>

267
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,049
-OSANA, OTORI, ONEMINE, KATAI, KOMI
-<i>Thanks Najimi!</i>

268
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,884
HASN'T ASKED YET

269
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,845
<i>Pick up!</i>

270
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,848
<i>Thanks Najimi.</i>

271
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,808
HASN'T ASKED YET.

272
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,770
Hello, Najimi?

273
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,189
I've caught a little cold.

274
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm sorry, but can you bring me
some Pokaru and something to eat?

275
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,285
Komi?

276
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,120
Komi!

277
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,708
I misdialed! Don't worry about it!

278
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,213
I'm really just fine!
I'm going to call Najimi now.

279
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,635
<i>I touched the wrong spot on the screen.</i>

280
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,136
<i>Get it together!</i>

281
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,764
-DOESN'T REALIZE HE'S STANDING
-Hello, Najimi?

282
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,275
<i>I have to go unlock the door.</i>

283
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,282
<i>I feel like I'm going to collapse.</i>

284
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,041
Thanks, Naji…

285
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,507
Komi?

286
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,302
Uh, um, I don't want you to catch my…

287
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,648
<i>K-Komi's here.</i>

288
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,074
CAN YOU DRINK?

289
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,242
Uh… Yes.

290
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,959
<i>It smells like ginger. It's good.</i>

291
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,878
I'LL BE USING THE KITCHEN.

Yes.

Ah.

296

Um, hang on.

297
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,841
No, uh. I can eat it myself.

298
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,388
KOMI IS EMBARRASSED BY WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

299
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,349
Thank you very much.

Huh? Komi! You're here!

305
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,448
Huh? You're not here?

306
