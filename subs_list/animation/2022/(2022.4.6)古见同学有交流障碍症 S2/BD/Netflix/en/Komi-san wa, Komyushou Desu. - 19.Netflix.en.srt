<i>Previously,</i>

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,095
<i>Komi took care of Tadano</i>
<i>when he had a cold.</i>

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,015
<i>While caring for him, she held his hand.</i>

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,267
<i>Then Najimi burst in.</i>

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,770
-Hey! Tadano, are you alive?
-INTRUSION

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,274
<i>Times like this, even if people with</i>

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>"What should I do? Was I seen?"</i>

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,948
<i>But they don't have</i>

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,951
FILLED WITH ANXIETY ON THE LAST DAY
OF WINTER BREAK

10
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,371
TRYING TO CALM DOWN

MISSION 64
"IT'S JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING."

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,511
NOT SURE WHY I DID THAT

13
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,022
Oh, so that's how it is!

14
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,315
Huh!

15
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,484
THAT'S HOW WHAT IS?!

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,571
I HAVE TO FIX THE MISUNDERSTANDING!

17
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>"Dear Najimi,</i>

18
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,701
<i>I want to avoid a misunderstanding.</i>

19
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,287
<i>I had absolutely no ulterior motive.</i>

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>It came from a place of friendship.</i>

21
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,375
<i>He was distressed</i>
<i>and I was moved to hold his hand.</i>

22
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,127
<i>So I did.</i>

23
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,713
<i>I repeat, there was no deeper meaning.</i>

24
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,007
<i>I have nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,802
<i>This letter is to help you understand…"</i>

26
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,721
LOOKS LIKE I'M APOLOGIZING
FOR SOMETHING SHAMEFUL!

27
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,972
AH

28
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>I don't know if I really was seen.</i>

29
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,977
<i>If I handed over a letter like this…</i>

30
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,648
Whoa, you did something shameful?

31
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,691
Huh?

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,075
<i>After all, I just held his hand.</i>
<i>Maybe it's not such a big deal!</i>

33
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,880
<i>For Komi, it was a big deal.</i>

34
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,299
-Good morning!
-THE NEXT DAY

35
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,261
SPENT ALL NIGHT WRITING IT

36
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,929
Ah, so beautiful.

37
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,223
I saw Komi on the first day back!

Hm? What are you doing?

42
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,655
TO: NAJIMI OSANA

43
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,117
Yay! A love letter from Komi!

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,535
WOO

45
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,038

<i>Seeing Tadano made her feel</i>
<i>more embarrassed than the letter.</i>

49
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,851
<i>Incidentally, the content of the letter.</i>

50
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,478
I WAS JUST TAKING HIS PULSE.
SHOKO KOMI

51
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,605
Pulse?

52
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,276
<i>That morning…</i>

53
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,490
-Can you go to school?
-Yeah, I'm better.

54
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:31,628
<i>I feel like Komi came over yesterday.</i>

55
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,422
-<i>I think she did come.</i>
-IT'S ALL SO HAZY

56
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,593
<i>But I was so sick,</i>
<i>it might have been a hallucination.</i>

57
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,596
<i>If it was a hallucination…</i>

58
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,306
Thanks for yesterday.

59
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,308
You helped me feel much better.

60
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,939
Uh, you came over yesterday, right?

EW

62
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,610
<i>So creepy!</i>

63
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,030
<i>Saying thanks for appearing</i>
<i>in a hallucination is too creepy!</i>

64
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,618
<i>I think she did come,</i>
<i>but I don't have proof.</i>

65
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,995
You're looking ill again!

66
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,832
<i>A-Anyway, if she did come</i>
<i>I do have to thank her.</i>

67
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,670
<i>But I can't ask her if she came.</i>

68
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,131
<i>It's too rude to say I don't remember.</i>

69
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,094
-<i>I do have evidence that Najimi came.</i>
-YOU OWE ME

70
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,805
<i>I should ask Najimi.</i>

71
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,604
-Yay! A love letter from Komi!
-WOO

72
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>I ran into Komi first.</i>

73
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,359
<i>It would be weird to avoid her.</i>

74
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,611
-Good morning, Komi.

HMPH!

<i>W-What does that reaction mean?</i>

80
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,255
<i>Why?</i>

81
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,133
IS YOUR COLD ALRIGHT?

82
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,385
<i>I guess Komi really did…</i>

83
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:08,099
<i>No, I accidentally called her,</i>
<i>so she knows I was sick.</i>

84
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,977
Ah, yes, thanks. Much better.

85
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,980
Sorry about yesterday.

86
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,567
<i>Alright! Now it's not clear</i>
<i>if I'm talking about the call</i>

87
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,986
<i>or when she came and took care of me.</i>

88
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,738
<i>It works either way.</i>

89
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,741

<i>W-Why is she looking away?</i>

92
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,459
<i>What should I do? I need more information.</i>

93
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,211
Anyway…

94
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,381
What did you do… after that?

95
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,552
AFTER THAT?

96
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,306

W-What's going on?

100
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,316
Morning, Tadano!

101
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,817
Oh, Najimi.

102
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,403
Do you know what Komi was doing yesterday?

103
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,155
Oh, Komi?

104
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,657
I WAS JUST TAKING HIS PULSE.
SHOKO KOMI

105
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,534
She was taking your pulse!

106
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,369
Huh? Pulse?

TREMBLE

108
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,457

111
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,508
<i>What is a narcissist?</i>

112
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,970
<i>The word comes from a Greek myth</i>
<i>about beautiful young Narcissus,</i>

113
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:33,893
<i>who fell in love with his reflection</i>
<i>in a pool of water.</i>

114

<i>And it's likely…</i>

115
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,067
<i>What's this?</i>

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,030
<i>While Narcissus gazed</i>
<i>at his own reflection in the pool,</i>

117
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,408
<i>he was surely fiddling with his bangs!</i>

118

126
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,894
I do love Justice Beaver.

-POINT #1
-Shows off taste for Western music.

128
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,527
-POINT #2
-Bangs his chair.

129
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,572
-POINT #3
-Blows on his bangs.

130
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,656
<i>Oh my.</i>

131
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,075
<i>I'm drawing attention to myself again.</i>

-<i>I'm so bad.</i>
-Nobody is watching.

133
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,496
<i>If I must…</i>

134
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,957
<i>I'll give you a little show.</i>

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,875
Nobody is…

00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,669
<i>Hey, is everyone gazing from afar?</i>

137
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>I could allow a quick chat!</i>

138
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,639

<i>But school started nine months ago.</i>

148
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,000
<i>And she hasn't spoken a word to me.</i>

149
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,128
<i>Perhaps Komi has social anxiety?</i>

150
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,214
He got that one right.

151
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,299
<i>No, not possible.</i>

152
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,468
<i>Her beauty is comparable to my own.</i>

153
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,762
<i>A flower waiting for a honeybee.</i>

154
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,141
<i>That's it. I've got no other choice.</i>

155
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,894
<i>Just know, my honeybee is huge!</i>

156
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,855
This statement isn't meant to be dirty.

157
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,028

158
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,827

I know your intentions, Naru-boy.

178
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,301
You're totally uncool.

179
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,928
Too self-absorbed.
You should get that checked.

00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,723
You're sick if you think you're on Komi's level

181
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,266
So cheeky I laughed.

182
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,602
Wash your sticky hair
before you go near her.

183
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,646
Baldy baldy baldy…

184
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,112
Oh! Komi, wait up!

185
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,325
Ko… Ugh! What is that?

186
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,660
<i>He continued to try to approach Komi.</i>

187
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,370
<i>Baldy… Naruse tried his best.</i>

188
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,373
If you want to pass,
you must first defeat me!

189
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,958
-CONCENTRATION GAME
-W-What a pain.

190
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,251
THROWING STAR

191
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,712
NINJA

192
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,883
NARUSE, BATTERED.

193
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,719
<i>The jealousy of my fans is amazing.</i>

194
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,471
That's how he is.

195
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:44,268
<i>Come on. You might love me,</i>
<i>but that's taking it too far.</i>

196
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:50,191
<i>Well, now I've got to go to the restroom</i>
<i>and gaze at my reflection to recover.</i>

197
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,901
<i>I don't feel well.</i>

198
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,903
<i>But I'm still popular.</i>

199
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,240
FLAP

200
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,625
<i>That's odd.</i>

201
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,336
<i>Usually, no matter how unwell I feel,</i>

202
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,381
<i>I recover as soon as I see my own face.</i>

203
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,345
<i>My chest hurts.</i>
<i>The world looks faded and dim.</i>

204
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,055
Stress.

205
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,124
And as I was saying,

206
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,251
uh, this goes like this,

207
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,503
-<i>Now I see.</i>
-And then that is like that…

208
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,088
<i>She's…</i>

209
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,756
<i>in love with me.</i>

210
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,925
<i>Is she looking at me now?</i>

211
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,051
She's not.

212
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,303
THE NEXT DAY

213
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,848
Actually, I did.

214
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,647
W-What?

215
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,865
W-What?

216
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,741
OFFERING TO TRADE NUMBERS

217
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,452
USER QR CODE

218
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,621
TAP

219
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,081
Huh?

220
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,176
<i>Komi didn't understand</i>
<i>what she was supposed to do.</i>

221
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,886
That's only natural.

222
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,937
He couldn't accept reality,

223
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,733
so he pretended he'd
been asking Tadano all along.

224
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,318
Huh? Me?

225
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,069
He's always like this.

226
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,572
But he's not a bad guy.
Go on and trade numbers.

227
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,449
Uh, yeah.

228
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,743
Tadano made a new friend!

229
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>Naruse started sending</i>
<i>Tadano a selfie a day.</i>

230
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,880
Alright. Tomorrow we're choosing
groups for the field trip.

231
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,924
Yay!

232
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,801
I was born to go on field trips!

233
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,053
That excited?

234
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,435
AFTER SCHOOL

235
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,686
Ah, Kyoto.

236
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,604
KYOTO

237
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,191
A fascinating wonderland where
the past and present interweave.

238
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,818
Heh. I can't wait.

239
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,737
Were you always such a Kyoto fan?

240
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,988
Tsk tsk tsk.

241
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,699
Tadano, the thing about travel.

242
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,285
It isn't where you go,
but who you go with!

243
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,370
Is that so?

244
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,081
But Kyoto's pretty nice.

245
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,500
-Temples and shrines.
-LOVES OLD BUILDINGS

246
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,627
The five-storied pagoda.

247
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,796
-Huh.
-<i>Totally disinterested!</i>

248
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,174
Komi, is there somewhere you want to go?

249
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,596
Komi?

250
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,854
SORRY. WHAT IS IT?

251
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,190
Um, is there somewhere you want to go?

252
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,780
I HOPE WE CAN GO TO THE ARCADE AGAIN.

253
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,991
Uh, I meant in Kyoto.

254
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,160
I WANT TO SEE GINKAKUJI.

255
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,371
Oh, very nice!

256
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,750
Kinkakuji is nice too,
but Ginkakuji is elegant.

257
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,837
The overall harmony,
the way the garden completes it…

258
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,171
How old are you?

259
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,383
-SORRY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-Oh, okay!

260
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,302
See ya later!

261
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,189
And it's like, was tofu always this good?

262
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,861
They just put it in hot water
and it transforms! Kyoto magic!

263
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,945
Huh.

264
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,199
Komi, where did you go
on your junior high field trip?

265
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,121
KYOTO

266
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,373
-Kyoto?
-It'll be your second time.

267
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,543
Kyoto's fun every time though.

268
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,337
It's Kyoto after all!

269
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,881
Why are you so keen on Kyoto?

270
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,967
Anyway, I'm quintuple-booked after this.

271
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,093
Q-Quin?

272
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,970
-What?
-Byeee!

273
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,642
Shall we go?

274
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,524
I'm looking forward to the field trip.

275
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,488
Najimi has over 100,000 friends in Kyoto.

276
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,698
What does that even mean?

277
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,542
Uh…

278
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,670
Are you alright?

279
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,884
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

280
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,885
Oh, uh.

281
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,722
You just seem a little down today.

282
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,812
IT'S ALRIGHT. I'M FINE.

283
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,814
Well that's good then.

284
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:26,568
But if something is bothering you,
you can tell me anytime.

285
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,280
I don't know if I can help or not.

286
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,492
But it might help you
feel better talking about it.

287
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,264
Okay, I'm going this way.

288
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,101
Take care on your way home.

289
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,270
See you tomorrow.

290
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,661
-VIBRATION
-Whoa!

291
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,455
-KOMI
-Komi?

292
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,166
Yes, hello?

293
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,836
Komi?

294
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,051
Um…

295
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,719
Yes?

296
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,433
I-I'm sorry.

297
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,269
Just now, I…

298
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,232
I told a lie.

299
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,110
<i>Actually…</i>

300
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,239
I have never been to Kyoto.

301
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,870
Actually… Actually…

302
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,251
Take your time.

303
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>In junior high,</i>

304
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,642
<i>we chose groups for the field trip.</i>

305
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,061
<i>And then,</i>

306
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,107
<i>I was the only one who got left out.</i>

307
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,526
<i>Naturally.</i>

308
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:37,533
<i>I-I didn't have anyone</i>
<i>close enough to call a friend.</i>

309
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,368
<i>And at that time,</i>

310
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,789
<i>I didn't have a way to communicate.</i>

311
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,582
<i>Naturally.</i>

312
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,003
<i>Then they started playing</i>
<i>rock paper scissors.</i>

313
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,466
<i>I joined the group that was left.</i>

314
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,137
<i>The faces of the people in my group…</i>

315
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,972
<i>I…</i>

316
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,684
<i>couldn't even look at them.</i>

317
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,689
<i>I thought they were surely</i>
<i>disappointed to be stuck with me.</i>

318
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,358
<i>They'd made this group of friends.</i>

319
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,028
<i>Or maybe they didn't care at all.</i>

320
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,825
<i>I would have been happier with that.</i>

321
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:25,038
<i>Maybe they welcomed me with smiles.</i>

322
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,665
<i>But…</i>

323
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,586
<i>I just couldn't…</i>

324
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,714
<i>raise my head to look.</i>

325
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:41,471
<i>On the day of the field trip, I didn't go.</i>

326
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,729
<i>I'm scared.</i>

327
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,483
But now you have friends.

328
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,194
Yes.

329
00:19:55,277 --> 00:20:00,782
But everyone has other people
they're closer to.

330
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:07,956
F-Friends who are
more cheerful and easier to talk to.

331
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,043
But you've got me!

332
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,505
And Najimi!

333
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,715
CAUTIOUS TADANO

334
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,972
<i>It's groups of three,</i>
<i>separated into boys and girls.</i>

335
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,933
TADANO = MALE
NAJIMI = UNCLEAR

336
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,101
I-I'm sorry.

337
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,687
That's all I wanted to say.

338
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,358
Thank you very much for listening to…

339
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,817
<i>Right.</i>

340
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:42,115
Well, if that's the case,
let's both skip out. On the field trip.

341
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,827
Huh? Uh, that's…

342
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,247
not okay.

343
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,166
I mean, I appreciate the thought.

344
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,879
But I know you're really
looking forward to the field trip.

345
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,008
In that case,
let's go by ourselves! To Kyoto.

346
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,343
Heh. Just kidding.

347
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,844
-CLICK
-<i>She hung up!</i>

348
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,472
Uh, Komi?

349
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,391
It was a joke! A joke!

350
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,768
I-It's alright.

351
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,312
I know.

352
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,855
-Really?
-SUDDENLY EMBARRASSED

353
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,945
Um… Thank you.

354
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,865
I feel much better now.

355
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,494
Oh, in that case, I'm glad.

356
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,957
And the field trip…

357
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,502
I can't wait.

358
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,380
Yes.

359
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,716
Me too!

360
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,347
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

361
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,559
<i>they struggle to communicate with others</i>.

362
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,060
It'll be alright.

363
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,604
Is everyone here?

364
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,607
We're going to choose groups
for the field trip.

365
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,068
Komi! Let's make a group!

366
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,029
<i>Bear in mind,</i>

367
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,489
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

368
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,078
<i>It doesn't mean they don't want to.</i>

369
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,413
LOTTERY

370
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,625
I figured that would happen,
so I made a lottery.

371
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,836
<i>What will happen to Komi?</i>

372
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,922
<i>Find out next time,</i>
<i>on the field trip episode!</i>
