T-Those chocolates…

00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,809
T-They're the ones that…

4
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,563
t-turned out best.

5
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:25,233
Aw, you didn't have to.
Thank you very much!

00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,651

Shoko!

12
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,748
It's time to go, isn't it?

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,711
What's wrong? Not feeling well?

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,920
Steamed bun?

15
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,048
You don't like the cold?

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,717
Did something happen at school yesterday?

17
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,928
SHE COULD GUESS.

18
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,388
SHAKE SHAKE

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,641
-Shoko! Go to school!
-PULL

20
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,272
You won't get
the perfect attendance award at this rate!

21
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,398
You don't mind?

22
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,905
She came out.

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,960
<i>When a person has extreme social anxiety,</i>

24
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,546

<i>Bear in mind,</i>

26
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,095
<i>they only struggle to form connections.</i>

27
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,849
<i>It doesn't mean they don't want to.</i>

28
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,204
Hey, good morning!

29
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,083
Thanks for the chocolate yesterday.
It was good!

30
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,796
-YOURS WAS GOOD TOO.
-Thank you!

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,176
But mine were baked.
You don't have to eat them all at once.

32
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,429
You got a lot of chocolate didn't you?

33
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,430
You'll gain weight.

36
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,645
Your chocolate was good!

37
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,023
-A sweet offering made by my sworn ally.
-WAS WAITING FOR KOMI.

38
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,108
It wasn't bad.

39
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,402
K-Komi!

40
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,365
T-The chocolate was v-very good!

41
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,952
Komi's chocolate had a higher cacao
content on the outside,

42
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,870
and a sweeter one inside…

43
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,670
I… I lost!

44
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,129

47
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,022
Good morning, Komi.

48

49
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,569
Uh, huh?

50
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,197
Why…

51
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,323
CREAK

52
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,326
Uh, never mind.

53
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,706
<i>I feel like I haven't</i>
<i>seen that face in a while!</i>

54
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,333
Tadano didn't dislike
the face she was making.

55
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,299
<i>But what's wrong, I wonder?</i>

56
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,552
<i>She doesn't seem angry…</i>

57
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,681
<i>Maybe because I ran after her yesterday?</i>

58
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>Or maybe I said something weird.</i>

59
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:15,690
There's also a good chance
it's not about me to begin with.

61
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,448

62
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,659
Oh, yeah. The chocolate.

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,870
It was very good.

64
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,039

Yes ma'am.

69
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>Hi! Ren Yamai here!</i>

70
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:56,147
<i>As always, I've got the seat</i>

71
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,859
<i>As always, she's godlike in her beauty.</i>

72
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,652
<i>You're dazzling, Komi.</i>

73
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,740
<i>The energy from her light causes</i>
<i>the moisture in my eyes to evaporate.</i>

74
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,951
<i>Or perhaps it solidifies the protein.</i>

75
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,497
<i>Oh! A rip!</i>

76
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:20,004
<i>N-No! Komi looks scandalous!</i>

77
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,465
<i>I… I have to take a video!</i>

78
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,176
<i>Just for me!</i>

79
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,514
<i>No! I can't let the rest of the class see!</i>

80
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,059
<i>For now, you can hide in my shadow, Komi!</i>

81
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,021
<i>I've got to hide it naturally,</i>
<i>so nobody notices!</i>

82
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,231
<i>Naturally!</i>

83
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,443
Y-Yamai?

84
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,987
<i>If I tell it to her straight,</i>

85
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,281
<i>Komi will surely be embarrassed!</i>

86
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,451
<i>But if I don't, she'll be</i>
<i>more embarrassed later!</i>

87
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,912
<i>I'll protect her on the way home too!</i>

88
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,706
<i>What should I…</i>

89
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,335
<i>No, Ren Yamai!</i>

90
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,046
<i>You were trying to touch the rip!</i>

91
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,883
<i>Y-You were subconsciously trying to</i>
<i>spread open the rip!</i>

92
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>I want to tear it.</i>

93
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,264
-<i>I want to tear Komi's tights to shreds.</i>
-Um…

94
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,891
<i>I want to see Komi in disarray!</i>

95
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,768
-<i>But no!</i>
-Yamai?

96
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,187
-Um…
-<i>No, Ren Yamai!</i>

97
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,606
-<i>I've got it!</i>
-Huh?

98
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,027
Komi.

99
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,741
Komi, there's a rip
in the left thigh of your tights.

100
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,293
It's alright. Don't worry.

101
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,754
I have some 80 denier tights
in the brand you use.

102
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,715

-Let's go!
-Huh?

106
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,519
Did the rip spread? Is it okay?

107
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,897
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,444
I should have told you sooner.

109
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,906
I was worried you'd be embarrassed.

110
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,202
It's even more embarrassing
if everyone sees. I'm sorry.

111
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,294
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.

112
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,131
Komi.

113
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,596
Oh, here.

114
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,223
I'll hold your old ones.

115
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,552
W-What is happening?

116
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,555
