Wherever you sit on the veranda,
one of the rocks will appear concealed.

119
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,534
There are many theories,

120
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:36,956
but adding 7, 5, and 3
to make the perfect number 15

121
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,125
and then removing one

122
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,336
is a message to look within oneself…

123
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,713
Hm?

124
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,424

Ashikaga Yoshimitsu is famous

Which anime would that be?

136
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,246
Yeah, here we go.

Well? You can't help but answer, can you?

139
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,214
Uh. What is it? I don't know.

140
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,594
It's a golden building
but it fades before my charm.

-…take a picture of us.

147
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,109
-Ah.
-Never mind.

148
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,988

00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,650
<i>That girl is always eating something.</i>

177
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,236
-<i>34, 35…</i>
-SHIMOGAMO SHRINE

178
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,655
<i>We're missing someone! Are they lost?</i>

179
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,490
Wow!

180
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>Oh!</i>

181
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,036
<i>My stomach suddenly…</i>

182
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,245
Um.

183
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,997
Paw…

184
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,457
-<i>Paw?</i>
-(WHERE IS THE) POW(DER ROOM?)

185
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,004
-<i>I'm exhausted.</i>
-Are you alright?

186
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,924
Oh, everyone.

187
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,136
On your left, you'll see the <i>Kyamo</i> River.

188
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,138
-Augh!
-KAMO RIVER

189
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:45,436
<i>It's alright. At any rate,</i>
<i>nobody is listening to me anyway.</i>

190
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,313
Here,

191
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,361
for some reason the couples who visit
sit the same distance apart.

192
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,155
That's what it's famous for.

193
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,284
They really are the same distance apart!

194
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,247
That's so interesting!

195
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,338
<i>Oh, yes. How could I forget?</i>

196
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:17,009
<i>If even one person takes an interest,</i>

197
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:22,515
<i>I've achieved my dream</i>
<i>of becoming the ideal bus guide!</i>

198
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:32,942
In spring and summer,
the river terraces make a stunning view.

199
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:38,030
I hope everyone will
come back to Kyoto again!

200
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,865
KIYOMIZU-DERA TEMPLE

201
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,661
"To jump from the Kiyomizu stage,"
is a famous figure of speech.

202
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,373
It's 13 meters above ground,
as tall as a four-story building.

203
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:52,044
There's a 90% survival rate,
but please don't try it.

204
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,672
Woo! From the Kiyomizu stage!

205
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,881
I will jump!

206
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,385
Hey there, Najimi.

207
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,683
From the right, they give fortune in
health, love, and academics.

208
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,476
Yamai!

209
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,067
<i>Hm? Those two aren't here.</i>

210
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,027
<i>Did they get lost?</i>

211
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,991
Oh!

212
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,744
Oh, you were here, Komi?!

213
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,289
-LOOKING AT THE ARCHITECTURE?
-Uh, yes.

214
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,083
It was made without a single nail.

215
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,836
Erecting such a big building on a cliff…

216
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,257
Every day thousands of people stand on it
and it doesn't fall apart. Amazing!

217
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,474
I spoke a little too fast.
That was weird, wasn't it?

218
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,766
Sorry.

219
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,354
I'M IN LOVE TOO.

220
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,947
WITH OLD BUILDINGS!

221
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,159
Yes, that's it.

222
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,952
<i>Get married already.</i>

223
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,913
<i>That's what she thought.</i>

224
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,123
-Um… Huh?
-RYOKO GAVE A PAW.

225
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,250
A traditional inn! A traditional hostess!

226
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,503
Our room is huge!

227
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,297
Hang on, are you in our room?

228
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,216
-Huh?
-Don't give me that.

229
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,386
Dinner was so good!

230
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,601
Each group gets 30 minutes
for the bath. Go now!

231
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,977
Okay!

232
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,314
Good evening! It's me, Ren Yamai!

233
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,732
This is it!

234
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,319
The biggest event of
the school trip! The bath!

235
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:45,866
<i>My goal for today is</i>
<i>to touch Komi's boo… her skin.</i>

236
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,036
<i>We're both girls so it's perfectly normal!</i>

237
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,747
That was a great bath!

238
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,667
<i>C'mon, let's go to the bath!</i>

239
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,377
WOMEN'S BATH

240
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,799
<i>Okay Komi. Your clothes… take them off.</i>

241
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:07,179
<i>C'mon and show me the breasts</i>
<i>I missed at the pool this summer!</i>

242
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,195
FIVE MINUTES LATER

243
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,406
-FOR YAMAI IT FELT LIKE AN HOUR
-<i>Why?</i>

244
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,367
-EMBARRASSED
-<i>Why won't you get undressed, Komi?</i>

245
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,952
Hey!

246
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,580
Hm? You haven't gotten in the bath yet?

247
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,998
Agari hasn't either.

248
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,252
It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?

249
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,254
To get naked in front of people.

250
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,302
In the bath during my junior high trip,

251
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,597
they called me "Meatballs."

252
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,393
T-That must've hurt.

253
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,813
If you hide yourself with a towel,
it'll be okay.

254
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,773
Here.

255
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,943
Oh, thank you.

256
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,820
Anyway, I'm jealous of you!

257
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,407
I'm super flat-chested after all.

258
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,536
Himiko, you're stacked!
You should feel confident.

259
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,123
<i>Himiko, Himiko…</i>

260
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,542
<i>This struck a chord with Agari.</i>

261
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,254
Y-Yes, Onemine!

262
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,139
DROOP

263
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,432
Meatballs.

264
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,439
<i>Those two ruined my view.</i>

265
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,152
<i>But I realized if I wait here,</i>
<i>I'll be able to see her.</i>

266
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,711
This seat is open.

267
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,609
It must be hard to have such long hair.

268
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,379
Komi.

269
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,590
Can I touch your boobs?

270
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,675
<i>So direct!</i>

271
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,136
<i>But wait.</i>

272
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,888
<i>Her eyes were clear.</i>

273
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,598
<i>As clear as crystal.</i>

274
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,687
<i>Clear as an alpine plateau.</i>
<i>Clear as a baby's eyes.</i>

275
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,399
<i>Yes. Ren Yamai had no wicked thoughts.</i>

276
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:10,237
<i>Komi's angelic naked skin had</i>
<i>washed away Ren Yamai's wicked thoughts.</i>

277
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,742
<i>Now, she was only thinking of</i>
<i>touching Komi's boobs.</i>

278
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,203
-<i>If that's not pure, then what is?</i>
-I WANT TO TOUCH KOMI'S BOOBS.

279
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,331
<i>But Komi still turned her down.</i>

280
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,964
Tadano.

281
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,923
Hm?

282
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,925
I have a riddle for you.

283
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,302
O-Okay.

284
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:41,101
It has four legs, but cannot walk.
I couldn't believe it myself, back then.

285
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,315
<i>T-This is…</i>

286
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,194
<i>This is the room where Tadano and I</i>
<i>and the others will spend the night!</i>

287
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,154
<i>I'm so nervous!</i>

288
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,658
-THE CLASS DELINQUENTS
-GLOOM

289
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,995
<i>We're stuck with</i>
<i>that weird guy in our room.</i>

290
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,872
<i>We can't goof off.</i>

291
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,083
<i>He's looking at us.</i>

292
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,294
<i>He's staring!</i>

293
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,758
<i>We'll be sharing a room.</i>
<i>I should say hello.</i>

294
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,428
TREMBLE

295
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,431
Evening, fellas.

296
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,642
-So we die tonight.
-THAT'S HOW IT SOUNDS

297
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,352
MEN'S BATH

298
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,564
They look so down.

299
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,067
Look upon my body and rejoice.

300
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,568
They won't rejoice.

301
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,613
Alright then.

302
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,877
Alright!

303
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,629
<i>Whoa!</i>

304
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,972
They rejoiced.

305
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,395
<i>Oh no, I left my lotion at home.</i>

306
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,065
<i>My skin gets so dry without it.</i>

307
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,608
-Katai.
-Hm?

308
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,280
Use this.

309
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:17,990
Katai.

310
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,909
You've got a great body.

311
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,954
Katai.

312
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,747
Take it off.

313
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,004
L-Like this? Is that alright?

314
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,966
Yes, it's good. Just like that.

315
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,427
-SAY CHEESE!
-Tadano, did you get the shot?

316
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,137
Uh, yeah.

317
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,390
It's a work of art!

318
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,393
H-Hey.

319
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,105
Can… we join in?

320
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,275
C'mon.

321
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,779
We'll make some art with
the Kyoto nightscape in the background!

322
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,072
Yeah!

323
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,374
-STARTING TO HAVE FUN
-More to the left!

324
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,960
The composition is perfect.

325
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,295
It's great! Wonderful!

326
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,006
Your bodies are like sculptures!

327
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,382
Washboard abs!

328
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,760
Wow, this is awesome!

329
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,681
F-Fabulous!

330
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,858
The fight for our sleeping spots!
We're holding a pillow fight!

331
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,068
The rules are simple!

332
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:41,281
The last person standing is the victor!

333
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,119
<i>I want to sleep near Komi!</i>

334
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,498
WAH!

335
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,046
BOFF

336
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,548
What are you doing, Komi?

337
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,883
You should jo--

338
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,163
Are you ready to give in yet, Najimi?

339
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,208
It looks like we've both
reached our limits, Yamai.

340
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,129
This is my final strike!

341
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,589
Last pitch!

342
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,475
Is everyone sleeping?

343
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,019
Good.

344
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,649
Yamai, are you asleep?

345
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,027
I could never fall asleep that fast.

346
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,820
So annoying!

347
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,327
TWITCH

348
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,304
<i>She was wakeful and couldn't sleep.</i>
