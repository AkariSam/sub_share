Happy birthday!

46

Huh? Isn't your birthday on the 25th?

47
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,631
It's a day early, but as a surprise…

48
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,758
-Huh?
-Hey, Tadano!

49
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,051
Not her birthday?

50
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,428
How dare…

51
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,515
It can't be a mistake! Maybe…

52
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,142
IT IS TOMORROW. THANK YOU.

53
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,476

Anyway, this is for you!

It's a birthday present from everyone!

58
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,822
Happy birthday and thanks for having us!

Happy Birthday, Komi.

H-Happy birthday!

-Thanks for having us.
-Happy birthday!

62
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,248
I'm finally going to be inside Komi!

63
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:34,625
Uh… Congratulations.

67
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,096
<i>it's hard to know</i>
<i>what sort of face to make.</i>

68
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>Times like this, I wish</i>
<i>I could say something reassuring.</i>

69
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,068
<i>"I think you can just smile."</i>
<i>Or something?</i>

70
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,822
Um… How about sending everyone
a thank you email afterwards?

71
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,533
<i>Typical Tadano response.</i>

72
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,789
Yes.

00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,543
<i>Christmas Party.</i>

74
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,378
<i>It may seem cheery at first.</i>

75
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,507
<i>Look closer and it's all</i>
<i>greed and strategy.</i>

76
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,218
<i>Everyone was thinking:</i>

77
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,560
<i>W-Where should I sit</i>
<i>so I can be next to Komi?</i>

78
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,270
-Augh.
-Oh no.

79
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,274
I'm gonna sit on the balance ball!

80
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,111
-<i>Some have no greed.</i>
-Can we just sit wherever?

81
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,863
<i>But the greedy ones.</i>

82
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,200
<i>The greedier they are,</i>
<i>the more their greed</i>

83
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,787
<i>stops them from being able</i>
<i>to decide where to sit!</i>

84
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,249
<i>Naturally, they look to Komi for a sign.</i>

85
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,625
SIMULATION

86
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,128
<i>Komi sits in a random spot.</i>

87
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,422
<i>Be the first to slide into</i>
<i>the spot beside her.</i>

88
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,094
<i>It's highly competitive, but the</i>
<i>chance of sitting nearby is also high!</i>

89
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,221
<i>It's the least risky method.</i>

90
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,266
<i>They all know this. They know it, however!</i>

91
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,979
<i>If Komi sits beside</i>
<i>someone who's already sitting…</i>

92
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,024
<i>That signifies a high degree</i>
<i>of Komi's affection.</i>

93
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,360
<i>The sense of defeat will be dreadful!</i>

94
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,573
<i>They are living within that risk!</i>

95
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,324
<i>Aren't they going to sit?</i>

96
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,535
<i>And then Komi.</i>

97
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,497
<i>Her first Christmas party with friends.</i>

98
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>She's never had so many friends over.</i>

99
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,669
<i>Uncharted territory.</i>

100
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,879
<i>Thus…</i>

101
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,258
<i>Her mind has gone completely blank.</i>

102
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,845
Shoko!

103
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,806
Could you carry the snacks and drinks?

104
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,184
<i>Here, Komi exits the scene.</i>

105
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,352
I'll help you!

106
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,770
I'll help, too!

107
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,857
<i>All at once,</i>
<i>the rock-paper-scissors begins.</i>

108
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,109
<i>Leave a spot around the table empty,</i>

109
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,987
<i>and guide Komi there.</i>

110
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,364
<i>They're deciding that seating now.</i>

111
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,661
<i>This strategy was communicated</i>
<i>in a single glance of solidarity.</i>

112
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,371
<i>United in friendship!</i>

113
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,333
Wow, I did it!

114
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,002
<i>I did it!</i>

115
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,547
<i>C'mon over, Komi.</i>

116
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,217

<i>I'll just sit on the floor here.</i>

121
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,698
I'll sit on Tadano's lap!

122
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,116
Hey, now what?

123
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,910
Wanna play Swamp Bros?

124
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,204
Hey, are we gonna have a toast?

125
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,457
-<i>Oh, I get it!</i>
-Hang on. I don't have juice.

126
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,503
<i>She was just too bashful</i>

Anybody want a juice refill?

00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,473
I'm already pretty full.

132
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,101
-Whose is this?
-I'll have the rest!

133
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,644
Well now!

134
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,313
Who's the king?

135
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,775
<i>What is the King Game?</i>

136
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,945
<i>Each stick either has "king" or a number.</i>

137
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,739
<i>The king says a number</i>
<i>and issues an order.</i>

138
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:38,703
<i>Often played at matchmaking parties,</i>
<i>it's an evil game of greed and strategy.</i>

139
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,204
Here! Here!

140
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,708
<i>Yamai suddenly started the game.</i>

141
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,043
I'm the king!

142
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,755
<i>Hasn't she been</i>
<i>holding that one all along?</i>

143
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,967
<i>Alright. I'm the king just like I planned.</i>

144
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,679
-<i>I paid off the ninja for Komi's number.</i>
-SIGNALS BY COUGHING

145
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,933

146
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,268
<i>Wait!</i>

147
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,520
<i>Should I exchange</i>

148
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,398
<i>Of course I've gotten it</i>
<i>from a secret source.</i>

149
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,816
<i>But it's not the same!</i>

150
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,527
<i>It's important that she asks me for mine!</i>

151
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
<i>That's proof that we're good friends!</i>

152
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>I haven't been able to ask until now,</i>
<i>so it's a good opportunity.</i>

153
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,079
<i>But I also want to make her</i>
<i>do something perverted!</i>

154
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,460
Me and number three.

155
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,961
Addresses…

156
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,379
Exch-ch-ch-ch…

157
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,506
A-Are you okay?

158
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,091
Who's the king?

159
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,093
-Me!
-So loud!

160
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,057
Me and number four dress as Santa!
I brought the costume!

161
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,558
<i>A new type?</i>

162
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,191
YAAAAAY

163
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,068
<i>The highlight of the party.</i>

164
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,236
Who's the king?

165
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,614
Uh, it's me.

166
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:01,494
Okay, how about number seven
massages the king's shoulders?

167
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,828
How about that?

168
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,040
Your shoulders are quite stiff, Tadano.

169
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,958
Yeah, I guess.

170
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,210
<i>Boring.</i>

171
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,379
<i>The lowlight of the party.</i>

172

Who's the king?

173
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,306
Oh… It's me.

174
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,266
Okay, what's your order?

175
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,395
Hmm. Let me see…

176
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,897
TWO MINUTES PASS.

177
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,818
It's hard to decide…

178
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,529
FIVE MINUTES PASS.

179
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,614
What should I do?

180
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,033
<i>In the end, it took ten minutes.</i>

181
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,160
Who's the king?

182
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,121
GRIN

183
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>Just say something.</i>

184
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,210
-MAKERU FAN CLUB MEMBER 3
-<i>Makeru will definitely try to compete!</i>

185
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,795
HEAVY BREATHING

186
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,215
<i>How will she manage to lose today?</i>

187
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,676
<i>The Makeru Fan Club has strange taste.</i>

188
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,053
Numbers one through thirteen.

189
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,722
Yes, everyone.

190
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,183
Say to me, "I lost."

191
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,436
<i>So that's how it's gonna be!</i>

192
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,105
Who's the king?

193
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,441
Oh! I-I-It's me!

194
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,445
Uh, um, n-n…

195
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,489
Number two treats the king like a dog!

196
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,657
<i>The opposite?</i>

197
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,909
Who's the king?

198
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,621
You called?

199
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,833
-<i>Your numbers.</i>
-Yamai, what number are you?

200
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,836
-<i>I can see them in the ornaments.</i>
-Not telling!

201
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,796
<i>Ren Yamai!</i>

202
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,548
So careless.

203
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,134
I'll sink you in a sea of shame.

204
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,305
I-It can't be!

205
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,766
Marsault Les Primavera's orders.

206
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,188
Number six. Spin around three times
before the king and bark like a dog!

207
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,406
Too bad, Nakanaka!

208
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,574
What?

209
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,160
She held her stick upside down!

210
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,705
-<i>I've been deceived by this woman!</i>
-COLORED CONTACTS

211
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,666
NUMBER 6

212
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,335
<i>What's this…</i>

213
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,921
Who's the king?

214
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,631
Me!

215
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,258
Since when?

216
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,261
I've joined in! Can I make an order?

217
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,346
Uh, sure.

218
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,848
Number four and nine kiss.

219
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,809
<i>She went straight for the jugular!</i>

220
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,229
-Uh… um…
-Kiss.

221
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,898
NUMBER FOUR

222
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,151
<i>Number nine… Who's number nine?</i>

223
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,903
Here.

224
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,197
<i>Shinobino.</i>

225
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,199
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

226
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,117
A-Alright, on the cheek.

227
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,911
H-Hurry up.

228
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,793
BLUSH

229
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,795
Why are you turning red?!

230
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,297
Who's the king?

231
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,761
Huh? Hm?

232
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:07,721
Huh?

233
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,223
Hey!

234
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,183
Who is it? The king!

235
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,395
Hm? There's really no one?

236
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,356
Huh? No, it can't be. Nobody?

237
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,529
Komi!

238
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,490
<i>W-What's her order?</i>

239
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,204
Y-Your order?

240
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,168
PLEASE KEEP BEING MY FRIEND.

241
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,172
<i>So heartwarming!</i>

242
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,632
Of course!

243
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,718
<i>The most touching moment of the day.</i>

244
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,220
<i>And after that.</i>

245
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:54,518
<i>Komi was in agony</i>
<i>remembering her embarrassing order.</i>

246
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,067
<i>Rewind the clock to noon on December 24.</i>

247
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,489
<i>Let's do something together</i>
<i>over winter break!</i>

248
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,783
<i>I said it.</i>

249
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,162
<i>But it's so hard to invite her out.</i>

250
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,831
<i>It might have just been, you know.</i>

251
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,625
<i>She was just being polite.</i>

252
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,753
<i>She probably doesn't want to hang out.</i>

253
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,883
-<i>Whoa. Komi's birthday is on Christmas.</i>
-SHOKO KOMI, BIRTHDAY DECEMBER 25

254
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,719
<i>Huh? What day was it today?</i>

255
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,262
THE 24TH.

256
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,388
<i>So, tomorrow is…</i>

257
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,599
THE 25TH.

258
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,142
Najimi!

259
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,020
Hey!

260
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:42,232
Tadano, I contacted Komi
and brought everyone along.

261
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,985
Oh, thank you Najimi.

262
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,447
I just can't get ahold of Yamai.

263
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,491
Even though it's Komi's birthday.

264
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,368
That's odd.

265
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh well, let's get going!

266
00:15:55,204 --> 00:16:00,334
Yeah! Let's go!
What should we do? I can't wait.

267
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,003
-She's already here.
-This won't suit Komi.

268
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,296
Oh!

269
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,424
-Wow, Yamai, you're here!
-ALREADY KNEW IT WAS KOMI'S BIRTHDAY

270
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,259
<i>Ren Yamai, secured.</i>

271
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,097
Alright! Now we have everyone.

272
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,099
Let's get started.

273
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,393
The Present Death Game.

274
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,686
Huh?

275
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,396
The rules are simple!

276
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,109
The one who chooses the present
Komi likes best is the winner!

277
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,111
The budget is 5,000 yen!

278
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,030
-Isn't that a little high?
-Ready? Go!

279
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,825
RECOMMENDED!
HIGHLY POPULAR

280
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,628
-Time's up!
-Yay!

281
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,630
Let's see what you got!

282
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,923
Who's first?

283
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,091
I'll go.

284
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,509
YAMAI'S CHOICE

285
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:55,139
I've known about Komi's birthday
since before summer.

286
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,016
Ever since then,

287
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,353
all I've been thinking about
is Komi's present.

288
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,273
A handmade cake.

289
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,858
A sculpture of Komi.

290
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,276
Sexy undies.

291
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,069
I thought of many things.

292
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,572
But none of them were perfect.

293
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,574
<i>None of them are any good!</i>

294
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:18,037
<i>In the long darkness, a beam of light.</i>

295
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,331
<i>The thing I really want to give Komi.</i>

296
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,625
<i>A heartfelt present.</i>

297
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,754
The answer is, "me!"

298
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,839
-Komi, take all of me!
-PRICE: PRICELESS

299
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,675
Can you not go there?

300
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,887
Heh. I chose this.

301
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,475
It's a digital society!
She needs digital cash!

302
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,226
That's not a present for girls.

303
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,936
You should be one to talk!

304
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,646
Here's mine.

305
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,732
Umeboshi?

306
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,027
They're tasty, never go bad,
and you can eat them every day!

307
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,862
Hmm.

308
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,947
Here's mine.

309
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:58,243
I need her to build up her body
so we can compete any time.

310
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,955
This is truly,
"sending protein to your enemy," right?

311
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,415
It doesn't even sound wise.

312
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,292
Here's mine!

313
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,711
-She'll never be hungry again!
-2KG OF ICE CREAM

314
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,379

00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,840
I-I chose…

-T-This book!
-<i>HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DOG</i>

317

00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,264
I chose…

319
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,475
this!

320
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,020
-Oh, those things you see in gift shops!
-OIL TIMERS, 3 FOR 4,480 YEN

321
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,148
These are so fun!

322
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:33,070
When I'm watching them,
before I know it the day is over.

323
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,822
<i>Why this?</i>

324

ONIGASHIMA, KISHI, SHINOBINO,

325
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:43,747
-<i>I couldn't think of anything.</i>
-NOTHING

326
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,250
I totally know how you feel.

327
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,501
What?

328
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,462
I expected this,
so I have a second selection!

329
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,964
Najimi's choice is this!

330
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,134
-DANCING SANTA FOR 3,780 YEN
-HO HO HO

331
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,927
Nobody wants that.

332
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,303
What?

333
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,681
You're picky about other's presents.

334
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:05,144
If you're complaining so much,
you'd better have something great!

335
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,355
-TADANO'S CHOICE
-I don't know if it's great…

336

-Here.
-160CM CAT PLUSH TOY

337
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,817
Wow!

338
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,236
It's huge! It's cute!

339
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,530
Your pick is surprisingly good!

340
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,282
-Surprisingly?

341
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,995
-But look at the price.
-Yeah, it's pretty expensive.

342
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,456
So I thought we could all buy it together?

343
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,543
Oh, um. You know.

344
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,462
5,000 yen per person is a little too much.

345
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,090
Komi would feel uncomfortable.

346
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,093
We're buying Christmas presents too.

347
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,347
I thought it would be just right.

348
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,474
How about it?

349
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,101
Boring.

350
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,271
-Sure, I guess it's alright?
-Yeah.

351
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,190
I think the cat's cute!

352
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,484
Alright, let's get the cat!

353
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,653
Yay!

354
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,739
<i>Wait.</i>

355
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,909

Komi!

Merry Christmas!

359

And…

360
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,713
Happy Birthday!

361
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,302
-Uh.
-Huh?

362
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,762
She's…

363
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,682
Hey, Tadano! Did we screw up her birthday?

364
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,808
How dare…

365
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,102
-Surely not…
-It's a day early, but as a surprise…

366
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,395
Yamai?

367
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,148
I-It can't be a mistake! Maybe…

368
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,358
IT IS TOMORROW. THANK YOU.

369
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,109
Oh, yeah, of course.

370
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,819
RELIEF

371
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:42,115
Anyway, this is for you!

372
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,578

Happy birthday! Thanks for having us!

375
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,209
Happy birthday, Komi.

376
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,962
-<i>Hm?</i>
-<i>Not very…</i>

377
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,380
<i>Her reaction…</i>

378
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,173
<i>It's not great.</i>

379
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,598

<i>It's like a funeral.</i>

383
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,023
Komi…

384
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,277
She didn't seem very happy
about the surprise.

385
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,736
Yeah.

386
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,032
-Whose is that?
-Oh, I think it's me.

387
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,534
Sorry, it's me.

388
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,369
Huh? Me too.

389
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,787
Everyone?

Ha-ha! So formal.

393
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,592
It's very Komi.

394
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,887

395
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,728
<i>They only struggle to form connections.</i>

396
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:57,816
<i>It doesn't mean they don't want to.</i>

397
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,948
Let's do this again next year, Tadano!

398
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,995
Yeah.
