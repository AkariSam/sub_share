00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,444
<i>They only struggle to form connections.</i>

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,530
<i>It doesn't mean they don't want to.</i>

11
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,992
Well…

12
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,161

-AWKWARD

19

<i>But it's alright, Komi!</i>

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,068

Um, I came up with a schedule for today.

22
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,201
Really? Kato, you're amazing!

23
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,996
I-If you don't mind,
do you want to use this?

24
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,290
Yeah, great!

25
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,711

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,475
Kato, what do you do in your free time?

32
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,686
Hm. I mostly play shogi.

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,938
Shogi?

34
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,732
Yeah. My grandpa was a shogi master.

35
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,150
He teaches me.

36
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,986
<i>You mean the famous…?</i>

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,363
How about you, Sasaki?

38
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,948
Who, me?

39
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,867
Oh, uh, you know.

40
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,079
Nothing at all.
Just sort of lazing around, you know?

41
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,457
How about you, Komi?
What do you do in your free time?

42
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>Nice pass, Sasaki!</i>

43
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,460
I LAZE AROUND TOO.

44

45
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,340

<i>"I don't have a beauty routine."</i>

46
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,093

Then I'll get one too!

59
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,843
-A-Aren't you walking kind of fast?
-IN TRANSIT

60
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,969

78
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,349

Whew. I'm so tired.

104
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,952
Why'd you make such a packed schedule?

105
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,960
If you had eaten your <i>takoyaki</i> faster,
we would've had more time.

Huh? What? My fault?

But it really was fun.

00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,467
You went to all that trouble

No, I'm sorry.

00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,820
<i>S-She's wild.</i>

182
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,072
H-Hey guys, let's scram!

183
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,324
Y-Yes, sir!

184
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,161
CHEERING

185
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,496
Um, Sasaki?

186
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,123
F-Farewell!

187
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,166
WOOSH

188
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,173
Mm. Isn't it good?

189
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,883
Oh, Komi!

190
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,636
Is everything okay?

191
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,972
I passed a strange masked person.

192
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,515
Oh, um.

193
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:47,229
A-A person with a yo-yo just rescued Komi.

194
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,400
Huh? Really?!

195
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,955
Whew, I'm so tired.

196
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,125
But I feel like
we got the most out of our field trip.

197
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,460
Right, you two?

198
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,214
STARE

199
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,342
Sasaki, about the yo-yo thing.

200
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,886
Huh? Yo… yo-yo?

201
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,597
W-Whatever could you be talking about?

202
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,188
Checkmate in nine.

203
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,482
<i>Kato entered the mystery zone.</i>

204
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,986
Just now at Movie Land,
the masked person who saved Komi

205
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,447
was using yo-yos.

206
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,158
O-Oh, is that right?

207
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,370
It's unusual to see yo-yos these days.

208
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,914
And a <i>hannya</i> mask! What a strange person.

209
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,124
Hm?

210
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,253
That person was wearing a <i>hannya</i> mask.

211
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,462
Did I say that?

212
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,380
BISHOP TO 4-B

213
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,426
Oh, no, no. I told you!

214
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,970
I passed a strange masked person.

215
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,764
Oh, that's right.

216
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,890
Ah, and this!

217
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,476
The under-eighteen yo-yo world champions.

218
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,521
Third place. Can you see it?

219
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,859
-Ayami Sasaki. That's your name, isn't it?
-PAWN TO 1-C

220
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,904
-Well now. It's a very common name.
-KING TO 1-C

221
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,491
On the train, you didn't say
what you do in your free time.

222
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,493
-You practice yo-yoing right?
-ROOK TO 1-D

223
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,829
-No, I really just laze around.
-KING TO 2-C

224
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,581
Alright, open your bag.

225
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,207
-There should be a mask.
-KNIGHT TO 1-E

226
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,585
-No! It's my private property!
-KING TO 1-D

227
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,045
ARE THEY FIGHTING?

228
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,842
I'm working on becoming
a professional shogi master.

229
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:46,682
The professional league is on
a different level from the women's league.

230
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,270
In shogi, there is a huge gap
between the men and women.

231
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,731
Four <i>dan</i>.

232
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,276
<i>How many women have</i>
<i>joined the professional league?</i>

233
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,862
<i>Zero.</i>

234
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,407
<i>But what does that mean?</i>

235
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,160
Male? Female?

236
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,621
It doesn't mean a thing.

237
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,499
I'll be a pro shogi player.

238
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,044
<i>Where my grandfather competed.</i>

239
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,546
<i>I'll go there.</i>

240
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,965
<i>I'm determined.</i>

241
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,384
I won't give up.

242
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,388
I'm trying to say,

243
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,851
When I see someone competing
on a world-class level, I love it!

244
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,811
I think that's really cool!

245
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,816
It was you, wasn't it? Sasaki.

246
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,276
BISHOP TO 2-D
CHECKMATE!

247
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,778
Wow.

248
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,863
-Oh, no, it's not me.
-ANNOYED

249
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,451
I already know! Hurry up
and confess! You have a yo-yo!

250
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,247
Aah! No! Stop!
Harassment! I'm being groped!

251
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,957
Give it!

252
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,129
I WANT TO THANK <i>HANNYA</i> FOR RESCUING ME.

253
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,679
"Even if it was just
a Movie Land attraction…"

254
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,431
"…the act of trying to rescue me
made me happy."

255
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,644
Huh? H-Huh? Hang on a second.

256
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,646
That was all an attraction?

257
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,525
<i>Oh, now that you mention it,</i>
<i>Sasaki seemed to misunderstand…</i>

258
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,740
I'm going to use the bathroom.

259
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,337
<i>Augh! This is the worst!</i>

260
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,799
<i>I… I'm so embarrassed!</i>
<i>I wish I could disappear!</i>

261
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,302
<i>This'll be a trauma for life!</i>

262
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,306
<i>So embarrassing.</i>

263
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,817
Anyway,

264
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,861
what's a girl doing with yo-yos?

265
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,155
These days, yo-yos are uncool!

266
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,866
-Let's play Bey over there.
-Yeah.

267
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,286
Let's go! Three, two, one!

268
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,747
Go, shoot!

269
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>I'm trying to say…</i>

270
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,838
When I see someone competing
on a world-class level, I love it!

271
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,798
I think that's really cool!

272
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,675
I WANT TO THANK <i>HANNYA </i>FOR RESCUING ME.

273
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,769
<i>I'm not embarrassed anymore…</i>

274
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,771
I guess.

275
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,278
Hey there! I'm Y. Y. Hannya!

276
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,823
Enjoy my yo-yo performance today!

277
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,952
BAM

278
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:58,374
<i>The future world-class yo-yo performer</i>
<i>Y.Y. Hannya was born that day.</i>

279
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,544
THAT WILL BE 4,500 YEN, PLEASE.

280
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,508
But I never thought
she would be right behind me.

281
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,885
I was like, "Whew, I've said it now."

282
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,346
Ah, that happens.

283
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,391
Oh, it's about time for lights out.

284
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,728
Well now.

285
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,439
Shall we begin?

286
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,984
Girl talk!

287
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,946
Well, Sasaki? Do you have a boyfriend?

288
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,281
Ooh, so aggressive!

289
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,576
Sorry, but I have no fun gossip for you.

290
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,912
How about you, Kato? Any crushes?

291
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,123
I don't have a crush either.

292
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,793
Hm? That's not the vibe I'm getting.

293
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,920
You're curious about someone?

294
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,464
C'mon now, out with it!

295
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,468
K-Katai.

296
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,514
Really? Isn't he scary?

297
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,058
T-That's not it!
I'm just curious about him.

298
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,935
It's not a crush or anything!

299
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,062
What do you like about him?

300
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,314
H-His eyes are so intense…

301
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,358
But it's not a crush!

302
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,570
I don't need all this attention!

303
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,196
How about Komi?

304
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,243
<i>We ask, but we already know it's Tadano.</i>

305
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,663
<i>You're always together.</i>
<i>It would be weird if you didn't.</i>

306
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,294
WHAT, SPECIFICALLY,
DOES A CRUSH FEEL LIKE?

307
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,795
<i>For real?</i>

308
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,089
Tadano, come in Tadano.

309
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,842
She hasn't noticed how a crush feels.

310
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,510
This is trouble! Over!

311
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:38,474
-<i>Tadano, Komi's super-duper cute. Over!</i>
-ONE-WAY TELEPATHY SENT TO TADANO.

312
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,853
Yeah, I mean, you feel relaxed together,

313
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,189
but sometimes you feel excited.

314
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,276
And you suddenly think of that person…

315
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,736
Stuff like that, right?

316
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,664
<i>So cute!</i>

317
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,958
-You do have one! What's his name?
-CUTE…

318
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,251
Who? Who is it?

319
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,880
Alright, just the first letter.
Give us the first letter!

320
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,258
Not his family name, his given name. Okay?

321
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,776
RELIEF

322
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,152
<i>It's H.</i>

323
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,321
<i>It was H.</i>

324
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,450
LAST DAY OF THE TRIP

325
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,035
The train is leaving!

326
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,330
Run!

327
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,626
You fool!

328
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:53,715
M-My Chrysanthemum Blade of Darkness!

329
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,437
They came right up to you!

330
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,564
Was that…

331
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,985
She fell asleep.

332
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,405
She didn't get much sleep
for the past two nights.

333
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,657
What's up?

334
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,160
-A NEW DISCOVERY.
-Komi sleeps too!

335
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,871
What did you think Komi is?

336
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,248
How can I put it?

337
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,168
I thought Komi was a perfect superwoman.

338
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,920
-Someone who never reveals a weakness.
-Yeah.

339
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,674
But we spent a whole day together
during the field trip.

340
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,927
And she's pretty cute!

341
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,222
It's like she's surprisingly approachable.

342
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,100
The Komi I had imagined,

343
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,561
was very different.

344
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,698
You're scheming.

345
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,576
It was weirdly fun, wasn't it.

346
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,661
-Tadano, Tadano!
-Hm?

347
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,372
Komi's being harassed over there!

348
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,291
Go rescue her!

349
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,088
-HIGH-FIVE
-STARTLE

350
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:20,761
<i>And now our plan to get</i>
<i>Komi and Tadano alone is mostly complete.</i>

351
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,890
<i>Now to fill in the seat</i>
<i>where Tadano was sitting.</i>

352
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,016
Huh?

353
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,980
You told me your crush.

354
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,067
You thought I wouldn't
act on that information?

355
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,276
Bamboozled!

356
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,532
Uh, are you alright? Komi…

357
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,952
Huh? She's sleeping.

RUMBLE

359
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,833
<i>Sit next to her.</i>

<i>Don't watch someone sleep!</i>

365
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,145
<i>That's rude!</i>

366
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,665
Oh, did you wake up?

367
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:36,128

I'M SORRY.

00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,605
-No, not at all.

-Oh, yes please.

375
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,167
I-It's so out of focus…

-Huh? Why would you lie?

383
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,308
I was kidding that I was kidding.
Help me up.
