00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,670
MISSION 52
"IT'S JUST A THOUGHT."

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:07,924
Who can answer this question?

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,050
Komi.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,177
Actually, Ushiroda.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,180
Yes, sir. The Treaty of Portsmouth.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,266
Yes, that's right.

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,853
-Hey, uh. It's not bullying, you know?
-Open page 125.

8
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,731
-It's more like the opposite.
-It'll be on the test so take note.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,900
-BREAK TIME
-Sports Day.

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,610
And the culture festival.

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,196
It's all so nostalgic.

12
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,615
I don't want to study.

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,117
Those are your true feelings.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,161
It's almost winter break, right?

15
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,289
Yes, it is. I can't wait!

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,582
Komi, where do you want to go?

17
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,833
Heh heh.

18
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,752
<i>"Are you reading my mind?"</i>

19
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,087
<i>"I know you are. Heh heh."</i>

20
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,048
<i>That's what that face says.</i>

21
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,050
Oh! Next is gym class!

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,177
Let's go, Komi.

23
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,097
What's up, Nakanaka?

24
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,265
Urk!

25
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,392
Mwah-ha-ha!

26
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,104
Tadano! You are
supposedly good at reading minds.

27
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,733
But it looks like you failed to read mine!

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,861
Um, you're trying to trick me
by assuming I can read minds

29
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,947
and thinking,
"You're reading my mind," right?

30
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,283
How did you know?

31
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,704
SUDDENLY FEELS EMBARRASSED.

32
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>Tadano understands what it's like</i>
<i>to have an overactive imagination.</i>

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,419
I see.

34
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,005
You want to know what Komi is thinking?

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,131
Yes.

36
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,133
As Komi's sworn ally,

37
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,470
I must learn to
understand Komi's feelings.

38
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,014
And as someone who can read her mind,

39
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,557
Tada… you…

40
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,060
I thought I'd ask for help.

41
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,437
You can call me whatever you like.

42
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,397
Let me think.

43
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,484
Even I don't know exactly…

44
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,029
Your methods. Teach them to me too.

45
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>She's here.</i>

46
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,825
Alright. Let's observe some scenarios

47
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,577
and try to guess what Komi is thinking.

48
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,206
That's a good idea! How unlike you.

49
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,124
Unlike?

50
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,334
Clean up the balls!

51
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,961
Hey, that's alright.

52
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,838
I'll do it for you!

53
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,174
Got it!

54
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,176
Yeaaaahhhh!

55
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,388
Now, what is Komi thinking?

56
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,641
Are you kidding? That's too easy!

57
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,894
"I'm free of a boring task.
Where's Yamai?"

58
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,354
-Right?
-Wrong!

59
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,731
Where did you get that cue card?

60
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,860
Here I am! Komi!

61
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,153
"Very good, peasant."

62
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,322
Wrong. You have a cue card too.

63
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,160
-The answer is, "I want to tidy up too!"
-FEELS GUILTY

64
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,078
Are you sure?

65
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,413
Probably.

66
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,457
Komi, can I borrow
your electronic dictionary?

67
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,381
10 MINUTES LATER

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,220
And then…

69
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,682
Okay, now try it with this situation.

70
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,476
"Shut up and give back my dictionary."

71
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,812
-Right?
-Wrong.

72
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,147
But I agree with you.

73
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,359
"They're talking, so it's hard
to approach them." Totally.

74
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,695
That's part of it.

75
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,363
-Very close.
-What?

76
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,367
The answer is,
"Are they gossiping about me?"

77
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,539
Wow! A rainbow! There's a huge rainbow!

78
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:30,001
Let's see! Where is it?

79
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,795
Wow, it's huge!

80
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,466
This is an easy one. Give it a try.

81
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,218
"I'll do what Yamai does,

82
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,970
and take a picture of the rainbow
for social media.

83
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,765
Oh, I should tell Yamai my account!"

84
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,308
-Yeah!
-Nope.

85
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,935
Are you doing this on purpose?

86
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,228
Heh.

87
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,440
"Who cares about social media?
Don't post pictures of the sky, dirtbags."

88
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,359
<i>That's just your personal opinion!</i>

89
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,401
Wrong.

90
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,655
-Huh? What do you mean?
-DIRTBAGS?

91
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,367
The War of the Women
is breaking out again.

92
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,660
<i>She doesn't fuss!</i>

93
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,537
<i>Even if a huge rainbow appears,</i>
<i>Komi doesn't fuss!</i>

94
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,040
<i>Komi's a much bigger person</i>
<i>than that rainbow!</i>

95
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,333
<i>Wrong.</i>

96
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,836
KOMI WANTS TO GO SEE IT
BUT CAN'T JOIN THE GROUP.

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,298
-HOME ECONOMICS
-Work with your group to make the dish.

98
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,301
Komi, you wash the vegetables.

99
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,353
-Huh? Komi?
-Okay, how about this…

100
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,688
Hey!

101
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,149
"I'm thinking about the next step
in the recipe." This is it!

102
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,736
"I don't know the next step
in the recipe." It's gotta be this.

103
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,322
Huh? Komi's good at cooking, you know.

104
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,324
Huh? Whatever!

105
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,703
The answer is,
"Thinking about the rainbow."

106
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,788
-DIDN'T GET TO SEE IT.
-She was still stuck on that!

107
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,959
"I want to eat Yamai's home cooking!"

108
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,336
"I want to invite Nakanaka to eat!"

109
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,337
"I want to be with Yamai!"

110
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,006
"I wonder where Nakanaka is?"

111
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,215
"I love Yamai!"

112
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,591
"I want to play games with…"

113
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,429
I'm the one who knows Komi best.

114
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:08,558
I've hung out with Komi alone you know.

115
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,854
Neither of you have gotten one right yet.

116
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,568
K-Komi!

117
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,778
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

118
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,239
What? What indeed.

119
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,908
We just happened to be walking together.

120
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,161
-Don't misunderstand.
-Yeah!

121
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,497
"I noticed that you were watching me."

122
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,791
"You were having fun talking, too."

123
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,918
<i>It's over.</i>

124
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,589
-<i>She's angry!</i>
-<i>She's totally angry!</i>

125
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,800
We didn't mean anything bad…

126
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,011
by it.

127
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,723
WANTS TO JOIN IN.

128
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,560
Since we're all here.

129
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,979
Let's go to a cafe after school.

130
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,522
<i>Why?</i>

131
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,483
-NOD
-<i>Is it really okay?</i>

132
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,235
At the very least let me pay for yours!

133
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,197
No, I'll pay! Let me pay!

134
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,324
-Me!
-No, me!

135
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,869
NOBODY HAS TO PAY FOR ME.
JUST STOP FIGHTING.

136
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,162
Okay.

137
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,872
KOMI! ME! KOMI! ME!

138
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,956
MISSION 53
"IT'S JUST A FANTASY, PART 2."

139
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,502
<i>Several days after,</i>
<i>"Of all the girls, who would you date?"</i>

140
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,671
<i>The boys got together again.</i>

141
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,009
The second round of
"Of all the girls, who would you date?"

142
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,260
Shall we begin?

143
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,512
<i>They're back at it?</i>

144
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,306
We failed to reach a conclusion last time.

145
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,311
Everyone thought about it at home,
and we put something together.

146
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,107
We've finally made a Komi episode!

147
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,193
Let's watch, along with two more episodes!

148
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,319
WOW!

149
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,280

ONEMINE VERSION

151
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,872
I'm so glad the weather is nice.

152
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,541
Yeah!

153
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,461
Ta-da! I made a picnic lunch!

154
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,531
Not a word!
I love how she does that silently!

155
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,533
She has immense big sister vibes.

156
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,453
<i>Onemine is the picture of stability.</i>

OTORI VERSION

158
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm home.

159
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,465
Welcome back!

160
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,843
Do you want dinner?

161
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,807
What's wrong?

162
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,979
I made a terrible mistake at work.

163
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,441
I'm done for.

164
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,991
There, there.

165
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,994
It's alright.

166
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,498
You'll be okay.

167
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,083
-Whoa.
-I'm gonna cry.

168
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,585
I wish she was my mom!

169
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,171

The era has changed!

172
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,349
Anyway, that's going to happen
to overthrow the shogunate.

173
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,060
My liege.

174
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,770
I see.

175
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,897
And when that happens,

176
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,400
Japan will have a bright future.

177
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,360
Yes.

178
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,195
<i>What an empty conversation…</i>

179
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,114

00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,824
Who goes there?!

181
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,244
Save your breath!

182
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,829
A windmill!

183
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:03,209
My husband is not
going to meet his end here.

184
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,879
Escape while you can.

185
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,215
O-Osho!

186
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,180
I'll be the one to face you.

187
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,559
I'll take several heads

188
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,228
before you go.

189
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:28,025
A period drama was the only way
I could imagine being with Komi.

190
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,319
You did what you could.

191
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,532
Alright, so who do you want to date?

192
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,701
I'd like someone who's like a buddy.

193
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,995
But I also want a video game partner.

194
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,330
But it's gotta be…

195
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,456
Ko…

196
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,883
<i>Meeting adjourned!</i>

197
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,221
<i>Fantasies must be done</i>
<i>in secret (from girls).</i>

BOY'S FANTASY EPISODE RANKING

199
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,892
NOT THAT I CARE!
(CARES A LITTLE)

200
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,646
<i>Deep, dark, glimmering hair.</i>

201
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,150
<i>Clear skin without a single blemish.</i>

202
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,653
<i>At once both like a regal empress</i>
<i>and a mother goddess.</i>

203
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,031
<i>An absolutely incomparable presence.</i>

204
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,160
<i>Komi.</i>

205
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,495
<i>Even she…</i>

206
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,208
-GURGLE
-PUNCH!

207
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,504
<i>…sometimes sleeps in and misses breakfast.</i>

208
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,966
LUNCH BREAK

209
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,510
<i>My name is Makoto Katai.</i>

210
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,221
<i>My hobby is sewing patchwork.</i>

211
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,224
<i>The other day, I made my first friend.</i>

212
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,562
<i>And I met Commu, a mentor for</i>
<i>communication, which I find difficult.</i>

213
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,066
<i>My high school life is going smoothly!</i>

214
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,444
<i>Today I'm going to invite Tadano to lunch.</i>

215
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,404
<i>Watch me, Mentor.</i>

216
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,031
-LEER
-SHIVER

217
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,495
<i>Here I go.</i>

218
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,081
<i>I've thought of the perfect line</i>
<i>for inviting him to lunch.</i>

219
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,584
-That was nice of the literature teacher…
-Tadano, hey.

220
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:12,004
<i>Oh no! Was that too casual?</i>
<i>I'm acting friendly!</i>

221
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,507
<i>But maybe a little too familiar?</i>

222
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,674
Hello.

223
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,052
What's up, Katai?

224
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>I forgot my line!</i>

225
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,894
<i>Commu is watching me.</i>

226
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,480
-<i>She really is scary.</i>
-STARE

227
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,440
Are you alright?

228
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,984
<i>I think he wants to eat lunch together.</i>

229
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,320
<i>Was I going to ask him to eat outside?</i>

230
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,988
<i>No, it's cold outside.</i>

231
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,617
<i>But in class with everyone watching…</i>
<i>What if he's annoyed?</i>

232
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,703
<i>Anyway I have to find the words. Uh…</i>

233
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,414
Let's take a walk.

234
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,124
EVERYONE'S FEELINGS INCLUDING KATAI.

235
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,418
<i>Now I've done it.</i>

236
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,422
<i>That was so rude of me.</i>

237
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,590
<i>I wish there was a hole</i>
<i>I could crawl into.</i>

238
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,637
Sorry, I'm gonna go today.

239
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,596
YOU'RE GOING?!

240
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,558
<i>Why does this always happen?</i>

241
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,936
-Hey!
-Huh?

242
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,479
Hey, Katai!

243
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,523
<i>A miracle?</i>

244
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,067
LUNCH

245
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,736
<i>Wow! Lunch with a friend.</i>

246
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,030
<i>It's a dream come true!</i>

247
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,784
<i>I'm sure my mentor</i>
<i>must have said something.</i>

248
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,619
-Go to him!
-<i>Mentor!</i>

249
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,163
<i>Thank you my ment…</i>

250
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,292
-<i>Mentor! Why did you come?</i>
-WORRIED ABOUT TADANO.

251
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,918
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

252
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,504
<i>Eating lunch together isn't the goal.</i>

253
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,550
<i>Having fun together</i>
<i>and getting closer as friends is the goal!</i>

254
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,970
<i>She's watching over me.</i>

255
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,681
<i>I can do it!</i>

256
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,725
Let's eat!

257
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,811
Wow. Katai, your lunch looks good!

258
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,730
Did your mom make it for you?

259
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,233
-Got any hobbies?
-<i>Is this speed dating?</i>

260
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,737
Um, I read comics
and I play video games a little.

261
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,155
Oh.

262
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,659
<i>A-Alright!</i>

263
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,162
<i>That conversation went great, didn't…</i>

264
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,124
-<i>She looks disappointed!</i>
-CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE IS SEEING.

265
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,086
<i>I've got to show</i>
<i>how friendly we're getting.</i>

266
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,672
<i>Oh! I know!</i>

267
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,549
Open up!

268
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,386
<i>Even Tadano couldn't help but flinch.</i>

269
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,347
HE WAS DISTURBED BUT HE STILL ATE IT.

270
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,890
<i>Yay!</i>

271
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,559
<i>How about it! Tadano and I are getting…</i>

272
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,021
-<i>No? Mentor, you're so strict!</i>
-KOMI HAS COMPLICATED FEELINGS.

273
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,483
<i>What more can I do?</i>

274
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,319
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

275
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,072
<i>My mentor is signaling what to do.</i>

276
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,324
<i>G-Got it.</i>

277
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,868
<i>I'm a little embarrassed, but I'll try it!</i>

<i>I-I'm shy, but if it'll bring us closer.</i>

284
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,975

<i>W-What should I…</i>

286
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,648

-WANTS TO STOP HIM BUT IS SCARED.

290
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,828
<i>I can't do this anymore! Help me, Mentor!</i>

291
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,329
<i>Chaos.</i>

292
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,791
You don't have to force it.

293
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,465
I'm not entirely sure
what you were trying to do.

294
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,303
But when you're with me,
you don't have to act tough.

295
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,764
You can just be yourself,
and that's fine with me.

296
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,685
Okay.

297
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,986

Huh? Komi?

299
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,701
Would you like to eat with us as well?

300
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,494
I'll introduce you to Katai.

301
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,996
<i>Lunch with my mentor?</i>

302
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,100
Katai, this is Komi.

303
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,062
I think you two would get along.

304
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,188
Both of you…

305
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,857
You can't say that!

306
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,983

307
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,194

308
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,821
Pretty much since the beginning.

309
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,950
I'll say it again. You can't say that!

<i>After all, it's funnier this way!</i>

311
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,627

312
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,962

FIVE!

331
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,477
-KOMI DID PAY FULL PRICE.
-THANK YOU!

332
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,688
MAYBE FIVE WAS TOO MANY.

TADANO

337
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,146
Why did I dress up like a girl?

338
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,690
I could have at least
changed for the after-party!

339
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,194
<i>A new page was added</i>
<i>to Tadano's dark history.</i>

340
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,239
<i>I got all caught up in the moment</i>
<i>and acted like a fool!</i>

00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,406
EXACTLY.

342
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,494
<i>How can I deal with these feelings?</i>

343
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,672

No! No, no, no!

347
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,237
I don't know what you're doing,
but stop shaking the bed!

348
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,158
<i>I've got to think calmly.</i>

349
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,952
<i>I would never feel that way.</i>

350
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:29,209
<i>Komi's beautiful and cute, too.</i>

351
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,920
<i>But that's precisely why…</i>

352
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,341
<i>No, no, no. What am I thinking?</i>

353
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,802
I'm going out.

00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,013
-To buy porn?
-No!

355
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,789
<i>Oh, Komi!</i>

356
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,374
<i>What odd timing.</i>

357
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,756
G-Good evening, Komi. What a coincidence.

358
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,633
BLUSH

359
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,135
You bought some roasted sweet potatoes?

360
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,140
It's so dark out, I'll walk you home.

361
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,395
Are you alright?

362
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,653
<i>I should invite her out.</i>

363
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,697
<i>I don't have anything happening</i>
<i>during winter break.</i>

364
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,158
<i>I do like hanging out with Komi.</i>

365
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,663
<i>As a friend, as a friend! Of course.</i>

366
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,294
<i>But if I'm going to ask her to hang out,</i>

367
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,049
<i>I should suggest</i>
<i>a specific day and activity.</i>

368
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,264
Okay, take care, then.

369
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,724
<i>I failed.</i>

370
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,148
For me?

371
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,277
Thank you.

372
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,868
Let's do something together
over winter break too!

373
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,251
Thanks for this.

374
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,294
See ya.

375
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,058
<i>Winter break has begun.</i>

376
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,400
BONUS SCENE

377
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,402
That was delicious!

378
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,737
Oh yeah, Komi!

379
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,031
You should get Katai to write his name!

380
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,161
-Ta-da! Komi's Book of Friends!
-JUST A MEMO PAD

381
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,040
We're getting all of Komi's friends
to write their names!

382
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,672
<i>I see. My mentor wants</i>
<i>the names of her apprentices.</i>

383
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,173
TADANO, NAJIMI, AGARI, YAMAI
YADANO, NAKANAKA…

384
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,424
<i>So many apprentices!</i>

385
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,176
<i>My mentor is so formidable!</i>

386
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,095
<i>Katai became her apprentice.</i>

387
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,013
