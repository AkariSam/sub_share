POMPH!

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,527

-<i>It doesn't mean that they don't want to.</i>
-BAM

00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,702

11
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,220
Shoko, your teacher called.

12
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,889
There's a storm warning,
so you're to wait at home.

13
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,101
NO SCHOOL!

I'll go look at the breaker with Shosuke.

Yes?

41
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,039
Could we…

42
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,293
talk… a little more?

43
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,257
Of course.

00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,678
<i>It has been getting colder outside,</i>

45
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,471
Yes.

<i>Try not to catch a cold, okay?</i>

47
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,809
Yes.

48
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,185
<i>Oh, by the way.</i>

49
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,898
<i>It looks like the storm will be over by</i>
<i>afternoon, so we'll probably have school.</i>

50
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,651
Yes.

51
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,577
<i>Ren Yamai was melancholic.</i>

52
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,541
<i>That day, the typhoon passed</i>
<i>and there was school from the afternoon.</i>

53
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,959
<i>But that's not why.</i>

54
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,877
<i>She was thinking…</i>

55
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,299
Isn't there some way
I could see Komi's panties?

56
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,718
<i>What is she saying?</i>

57
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,262
<i>She couldn't see Komi's panties,</i>

58
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,472
<i>which made her fully melancholic.</i>

59
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,724
<i>Komi…</i>

60
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,809
<i>Wherefore art thou Komi?</i>

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,395
<i>As if to rouse my heart,</i>

62
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,066
<i>she is clad in blue,</i>
<i>flaunting tights of inky black.</i>

63
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>Of course I want to see her panties</i>
<i>through her tights!</i>

64
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,868
<i>Must… find a way.</i>

65
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,080

00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,582
Oh.

<i>I can tell she's up to no good…</i>

70
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,714
-Yeah, and then…
-Komi!

71
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,759
There's a huge puddle in the schoolyard!

72
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,968
Let's go see it!

73
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,136
<i>A puddle?</i>

74
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,472
<i>Surely she won't fall for…</i>

75
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,432
-NOD
-<i>She fell for it!</i>

76
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,893
Woo! Yay!

77
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,229
<i>The stage is set.</i>

78
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>Puddles around the schoolyard.</i>

79
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,650
<i>They'll reflect Komi's panties…</i>

80
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,652
<i>It's the perfect strategy!</i>

81
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,821
<i>Oh, Komi.</i>

82
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,240
<i>What sort of panties will you show me?</i>

83
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,034
<i>Should I stop her?</i>

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,412
Woo! Yay!

85
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,372
Najimi?

86
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,917
Could you come over here?

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,210
<i>Najimi! Run!</i>

88
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,465
<i>Oh, there's wind!</i>

89
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,134
<i>Blow wind blow!</i>

90
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,137
<i>Blow to reveal Komi's panties!</i>

91
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,598
Whoa! Oh no!

92
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,809
<i>Not hers!</i>

93
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,269
<i>I'm left with no other choice!</i>

94
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,106
Oops! I fell!

00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,031
Hey, there's a rainbow!

98
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,617
<i>Who cares about a stupid rainbow!</i>

99
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,411
<i>I just want to see Komi's panties!</i>

100
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,553
<i>Who cares about panties!</i>

101
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,389

-TWO DAYS LATER

NAJIMI VERSION

<i>Something started!</i>

113
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,745
That was wild.

114
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,707
We rode so many attractions!

115
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,542
I'm pretty tired.

116
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,253
Let's take a break.

117
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,046
We can get some ice cream.

118
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,008
Wow, this flavor is great!

119
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,509
Gotcha!

120
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,639
Don't let your guard down so much!

121
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,350
<i>Let's go on that ride next!</i>

122
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,769
<i>Whoa, you want to keep at it?</i>

123
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,481
It would be fun,
like hanging out with a buddy..

124
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,400
Dabbing ice cream on your nose.
That's a high score.

125
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,986

00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,453
I-I'm sorry!

129
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,998
I was deciding what to wear,
and ran behind schedule.

130
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,417
Did you wait long?

131
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,047
No, not long. I just got here.

132
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,216
Oh good.

133
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,345
You're wearing such a bold outfit today.

134
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,139
Oh! That's, uh…

135
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,229
If it's you, I thought it'd be okay…

136
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,565
What's okay?! Okay to do what?

137
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,942
You mean her boobs?

138
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,193

Hey, cheer up already, alright?

141
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,788
Maybe the food wasn't great, but still.

142
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,373
Close your mouth.

143
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,459
You've got poor taste.
That's why this happened.

144
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,211
I said I was sorry.

145
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,005
Oh yeah. Here.

146
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,511
It's been a month, right?

147
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,096
For our anniversary.

148
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,559
What is this? They're awful!

149
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,271
You really have no taste.

150
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,442
Let's go already! Ugh.

151
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,447
As she says it, the new earrings
glitter on her ears.

152
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,616
Thank you so much!

153
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,784

NAKANAKA VERSION

Oh, not there.
There's a chest up to the right.

157
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,172
To the right?

158
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,884
I told you, not there.
Give me that. I'll get it.

159
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,472
Wow! You got it!

160
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,269
Don't you know it!

161
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,815
And then we'd play the game together.

162
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,650
Wow. So cute.

163
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,818
What is this feeling?

164
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,529
That chill vibe. It's exquisite.

165
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,656

-Hey!

170
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,088
I've harvested lots of

00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,174
<i>This is Inaka.</i>

172
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,052
<i>She's the daughter of</i>

00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,972
Shinobino. Go on, try one!

174
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,391
Alright. Just one.

175
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,150
You like it?

176
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,279
I love to watch her from afar.

177
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,032
That's why I take the long way home.

178
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,116
How sophisticated!

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,703
The way Inaka is from the country
but thinks she's hiding it.

180
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,954
It's so cute.

181
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,998
<i>Oh, they noticed.</i>

182
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,249
OF ALL THE GIRLS, WHO WOULD YOU DATE?
MAKERU VERSION

183
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,709
Thank you.

184
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,088
Ooh. It's cold.

185
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,673
Let's hurry home and eat something warm.

186
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,675
Oh. Yes.

187
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,220
I'll race you home!

188
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,388
No fair!

189
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,895
Yay! I won!

190
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,651
Huh? Wow, that's awesome.

191
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,945
Chiarai, you like Makeru don't you!

192
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,947
<i>Yadano's really cute?!</i>

193
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,455
And now for the pièce de résistance. Komi.

194
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,790
You wanna do it?

195
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,209
I'll make a perfect episode.

196
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,877
<i>Their game has changed?</i>

197
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,966
5 MINUTES LATER

198
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,175
This is tough.

199
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,344
I can't imagine it.

200
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,096
10 MINUTES LATER

201
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,265
Being alone with Komi?

202
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,891
It's just not possible!

203
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,060
I'm woefully unworthy!

204
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,940
OF ALL THE GIRLS, WHO WOULD YOU DATE?
KOMI VERSION

205
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,192
That was delicious!

206
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,737
I'll do the dishes.

207
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,825
We can decide using
rock, paper, scissors then.

208
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,785
Rock, paper…

209
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,213
Oh, Komi. You can rest.

210
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,343
Uh… Thank you.

211
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,606
-Whoa!
-HOW CAN I IMAGINE THAT!

212
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,191
That scared me!

213
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,151
Why's he screaming?

214
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,652
Is he alright?

215
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,658
MISSION 50
"IT'S JUST A CAT CAFE."

216
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,411
<i>All the cute kitties are here!</i>

217
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,163
<i>We're featuring cat cafes!</i>

218
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,249
<i>Today we look at some trendy cat cafes!</i>

219
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,918
I SAW IT ON A NEWS PROGRAM

220
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,212
Wow, a cat cafe?

221
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,005
Hm.

222
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,842
-COME WITH ME?
-Sorry I can't.

223
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,885
Quick response!

224
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,971
Oh, yeah. You have a cat allergy.

225
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,515
Yeah, I do.

226
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,518
I wish I could kiss
those cute kitties though.

227
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,727
Ew.

228
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,687
-See ya!
-WHAT ABOUT YOU?

229
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,856
Huh? Me?

230
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,982
Yea…

231
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,986
Ah.

232
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,659
Oh, sorry. I already have plans.

233
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,370
Why don't you invite someone else?

234
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,121
How about Onemine?

235
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,293
-You called?
-She came!

236
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,713
Try inviting her!

237
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,595
CAT CA…

238
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,972
Sure!

239
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,516
<i>Dependable Onemine!</i>

240
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,601
Welcome!

241
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:17,523
Ta-da! I came too!

242
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,109
We did come together, so I knew that.

243
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,945
Good kitty.

244
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,114
Hm? Who's this?

245
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,324
KOMI GOES INTO SHOCK
FROM CUTENESS OVERLOAD

246
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
STARTLE

247
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,252
Wow, it's my first time here.

248
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,963
They really let the cats roam free.

249
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,966
That one's sleeping.

250
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,179
Wow, they're all so tame.

251
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,931
So friendly!

252
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,225
-NONE OF THE CATS APPROACH KOMI
-SILENCE

253
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,185
Kaede, did the cats come to you?

254
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,900
-So many!
-There, there. You're such good kitties!

255
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,862
K-Kaede? Kaede!

256
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,865
-VERY JEALOUS
-EXHALE

257
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,950
<i>I've never seen that face before.</i>

258
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,413
Komi, look! That cat is sleeping.

259
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,831
Try petting it!

260
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,043
<i>If it's asleep, it won't run away.</i>

261
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,463
LOITER

262
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,549
-Socially awkward with cats too!
-IT'S SLEEPING. I MIGHT BOTHER IT.

263
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,926
CHOCOLAT (FEMALE)

264
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,011
<i>My name is Chocolat.</i>

265
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,263
<i>I'm the boss of this cat cafe.</i>

266
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:36,727
<i>Once again today,</i>
<i>the cafe is full of idiotic people.</i>

267
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,687
<i>First, let me say this.</i>

268
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,066
<i>I hate being touched by people.</i>

269
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,820
<i>Humans don't think about cats' feelings</i>
<i>and just force themselves on us.</i>

270
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,074
-<i>My freshly groomed coat gets ru--</i>
-Boss!

271
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,575
There's a scary human--

272
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,286
Don't interrupt when I'm talking!

273
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,371
SILVER VINE

274
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,247
So what is it?

275
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,500
There's a scary human here.

276
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,169
I don't know what she's thinking.

277
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,963
Her aura is scary!

278
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,214
What do you mean, aura?

279
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,632
Which one is it?

280
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,841
Uh…

281
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,595
That's her! With long, black hair.

282
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,639
She's just a regular human.

283
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,556
BLACK CAT!

284
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,475
LOVES BLACK CATS

285
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:20,646
There's certainly something
unknowable about her.

286
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,148
Let's keep an eye on her for now.

287
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,664
Look at that. She can't touch us at all.

288
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,710
Did you want a companion that badly?
Pitiful human.

289
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,004
Heh. Serves you right.

290
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,677
Humans are such a pain.

291
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,431
Huh? Boss? Where are you going?

292
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,182
Boss! Boss!

293
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,144
Boss. Are you serious?

294
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,354
Are you going to her? To that female…

295
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,606
Wow.

296
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,118
Oh, wow!

297
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,246
Chocolat never approaches people.

298
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,296
Meow.

299
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,090
AWW

300
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,636
What an adorable black cat!

301
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,221
Yeah!

302
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,560
FROM ONEMINE

303
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,691
<i>I should have gone.</i>

304
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,112
<i>He wanted Komi to practice</i>
<i>inviting other people.</i>

305
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,449
<i>So Tadano stayed home</i>
<i>even though he didn't have plans.</i>

306
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,992
<i>Total letdown.</i>

307
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,996
HE SPENT THREE DAYS
THINKING ABOUT MAKING IT HIS LOCKSCREEN

308
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,248
MISSION 51
"IT'S JUST THE 'I LOVE YOU GAME'."

309
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,212
Komi, um.

310
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,340
It's, uh.

311
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,510
Hey.

312
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,972
I love you.

313
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,232
What is the "I Love You Game"?

314
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,733
<i>Say "I love you."</i>

315
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,028
<i>If the other person reacts</i>
<i>by smiling or blushing, you win.</i>

316
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
<i>You can phrase it how you like.</i>

317
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,949
<i>-And create a specific situation.</i>
-I love you.

318
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,618
<i>Anyhow, if you blush you lose.</i>

319
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,537
LOSE

320
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,916
<i>Komi was lured into this game by Yamai.</i>

321
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,252
Oh Komi, you're so tough!

322
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:52,005
<i>Yeah but I just wanted</i>
<i>to tell Komi I love her.</i>

323
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,133
<i>I don't care if I win or lose.</i>

324
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,468
<i>As long as I can tell Komi I love her.</i>

325
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,306
Alright, it's your turn. Now say it to me.

326
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,892
<i>Here it comes! I've been waiting for this!</i>

327
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,311
<i>I can legally hear Komi say she loves me.</i>

328
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,896
<i>I've been waiting!</i>

329
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,483
<i>Alright, what are you going to</i>
<i>say to me, Komi?</i>

330
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,485
<i>What? "I?"</i>

331
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,405
<i>Hey, c'mon. Try saying it, Komi.</i>

332
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>"I?" "I love?"</i>

333
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,200
<i>"I love y…"</i>

334
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,496
<i>She started grinning before Komi began,</i>
<i>so she lost.</i>

335
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,081
Let's go again!

336
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,833
What? What are you doing?

337
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,668
<i>Just when it was getting good!</i>

338
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,255
Hm? We're not doing anything.

339
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,590
Right, Komi?

340
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,884
Really?

341
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,260
Yes, really!

342
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,471
Playing hide and seek by yourself
would be way more fun.

343
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,806
Go try it!

344
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,100
Oh, by the way, Komi.

345
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,227
I love you.

346
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,353
<i>Trickster!</i>

347
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,189
You did a spit-take didn't you?

348
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,607
I win!

349
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,566
DENIES

350
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,818
Alright, Tadano, you judge!

351
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,195
Me?

352
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,408
IT WAS SO SUDDEN SHE DID A SPIT-TAKE

353
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,660
No blush so she's safe.

354
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,995
-Playing favorites!
-KOMI HAS BEGUN TO ENJOY THIS GAME

355
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,958
I love you!

356
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,630
I love you.

357
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,841
Komi's so tough!

358
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,677
It has come to this.
Time for the big guns.

359
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,970
Tadano, come on!

360
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,055
Me?

361
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:37,110
No no no! That would be… you know!

362
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,820
-What's with the pause?
-NOD

363
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,282
There's nothing to be embarrassed about!
It's just a game!

364
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,701
If you protest, you look suspicious!

365
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,788
<i>-There's no escape!</i>
-TADANO, YOU GET IT DON'T YOU?

366
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,457
<i>Outsmarted again by their cunning tactics!</i>

367
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,376
-<i>Antenna-looking onion-head!</i>
-ANTENNA-LOOKING ONION-HEAD

368
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,002
Hurry, hurry!

369
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,547
<i>It's a game. Just a game!</i>

370
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,218
<i>I don't have to be shy.</i>
<i>Just pretend it's a joke.</i>

371
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>Alright!</i>

372
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,394
-I…
-You lose!

373
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,355
Hang on. The person speaking can't smile?

374
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,358
Of course not!
It's embarrassing to say it after all.

375
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,485
Oh, right. I guess so.

376
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,946
-I LOVE YOU GAME OVER
-Here's some trivia you can use!

377
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,825
-<i>Komi reacted less than I thought.</i>
-Wombats poop cubes.

378
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,787
<i>I guess it wouldn't</i>
<i>mean anything to her if I said it.</i>

379
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,707
-Can't use that!
-Can too!

380
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,875
<i>I guess I worried for nothing.</i>

381
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,836
-Can't use it.
-Sure you can!

382
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,671
Oh, going to the restroom?

383
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,798
-Don't fall in!
-Oh, me too!

384
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,967
Let me go!

385
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,596
Let me go! Let me go!

386
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,313
<i>"I'm glad they stopped him."</i>

387
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,939
<i>and,</i>

388
00:21:56,023 --> 00:22:00,902
<i>"I wish he had said it."</i>
<i>were the two feelings in Komi's heart.</i>

389
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,402
BONUS SCENE

390
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,073
Welcome!

391
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,924
<i>Chocolat also stamped her paw</i>
<i>in Komi's Book of Friends.</i>

392
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,927
<i>85 left to go meow.</i>
