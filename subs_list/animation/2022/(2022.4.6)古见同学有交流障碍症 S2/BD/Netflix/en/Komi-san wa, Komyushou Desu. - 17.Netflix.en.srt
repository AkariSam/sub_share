If a snowball hits you
and breaks, you're dead!

31
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,726
Hit!

32
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,019
If it doesn't break, you're safe!

33
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:11,936

38
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,995
Why is Komi on the elementary school team?

39
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,497
It's to keep the numbers even! Ha-ha.

40
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,916
-<i>I feel like there's something more…</i>
-HAVING FUN

41
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,252
We won't lose to some high schoolers!

42
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,379
Yeah!

43
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,341
Huh?

44
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,844
-<i>What's up with her…</i>
-<i>She doesn't speak at all!</i>

45

00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,752
-CAN I REALLY THROW THIS?
-IT MIGHT HURT.

56
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,295

<i>We have three people left.</i>
<i>We have to cooperate!</i>

64
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,520

-H-Hey. Look!
-Hm?

82
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,570
Since when was there only one enemy left?

83
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,074
<i>Just seconds before.</i>

84
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,545
No!

85
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,969
<i>They were aiming at Komi,</i>
<i>so Yamai killed them.</i>

86
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,352
I did it for you, Komi.

87
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,647
I killed Najimi and Yadano.

88
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,773
Okay?

89
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,615

Thank you for another year.

00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,730

-I haven't seen you since summer holidays!
-Yeah!

104
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,903
My first summer break since I turned 17!

105
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,821
Hey now.

106
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,115
What? Is that Shoko?

107
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,786
You get prettier and prettier
every time I see you.

108
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,246
<i>Déjà vu.</i>

109
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,459
And Shosuke. You're handsomer than ever!

110
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,670
Shosuke!

111
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,176

00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,444
BOO

114
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,362
THUD THUD

115
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,701
And then Ms. Aoyama stopped
the potter's wheel…

116
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,370
DIDN'T THINK SHE'D BE SO SURPRISED.

117
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,288
THUD THUD

118
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,834
Wow! But I suppose I would do the same.

119
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,380
Don't fall!

120
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,507
They get along well.

121
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>They've started having fun.</i>

122
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,682

Hanafuda!

125
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,898
Let's play Hanafuda!

SUDDEN DESPAIR

127
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,577
Oh. Akira always cries when she's happy.

128
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,961
We'll play <i>Koi-koi</i>.
The simplest rules. Okay?

129
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,296
Shoko, do you know how to play?

130
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,506
SHAKES HEAD

131
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,299
I'll explain.

132
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,885
The ones with a ribbon are slips.

133
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,429
Ten dregs are worth one point.

134
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,893
And one extra point
for each dreg after that…

135
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,564
Oh Grandma, do you want to play too?

136
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,405
I'll play too.

137
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,033
-Alright, Grandma and I will show you how.
-SHOCKED BY GRANDMA.

138
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,577
Shoko, you can watch.

139
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,164
We'll play six rounds.
With Cup Cherry and Cup Moon.

140
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:52,128
One point is a hundred yen.
Winnings go to your New Year's gift money.

141
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,256
But if you lose,
I'll take it out of your gift money.

142
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,008
I'll let you deal, Akira.

143
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,346
Yeah?

144
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,141
YUIKO VS AKIRA

145
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:10,146
<i>This is how the Grandma Yuiko vs. Akira</i>
<i>Hanafuda Battle began.</i>

146
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,941
<i>First up, Akira.</i>

147
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,486
<i>She uses the Cherry Dreg to pick up</i>
<i>the Cherry Curtain from the field.</i>

148
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,363
<i>A sensible move.</i>

149
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,490
<i>She drew…</i>

150
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,827
<i>Pine with Red Slip.</i>
<i>There's no Pine in the field.</i>

151
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,997
<i>Yuiko is next. She chooses…</i>

152
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,082
<i>Pampas Moon.</i>

153
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,836
-<i>Her opponent takes a Bright card.</i>
-BRIGHT: VALUABLE, 5 IN TOTAL

154
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,840
<i>But in Akira's hand, there's already…</i>

155
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,509
-<i>The Chrysanthemum Cup card.</i>
-CUP & CHERRY BRIGHT: 5 POINTS

156
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,554
<i>A fearless smile.</i>

157
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,183
<i>But there still isn't</i>
<i>a Chrysanthemum card in the field.</i>

158
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,519
<i>Akira collects the Peony and Butterfly.</i>

159
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,482
<i>The card from the deck,</i>
<i>is Plum and Bush Warbler.</i>

160
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,443
<i>She takes the Plum and Red Slip</i>

161
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,360
AKIRA'S HAND

162
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,403
<i>A good start!</i>

163
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,405
<i>A very good start!</i>

164
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,492
<i>And then…</i>

165
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,119
<i>There! The Chrysanthemum card!</i>

166
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,583
<i>She plays the Chrysanthemum Cup.</i>

167
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,918
<i>She already got a combo!</i>

168
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,879
<i>Cup Cherry for 5 points.</i>

169
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,215
<i>It's enough to call the game.</i>

170
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,842
<i>But Akira chose…</i>

171
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,302
<i>Koi-koi.</i>

172
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,970
<i>…to continue playing!</i>

173
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,474
<i>Akira decided she could still squeeze</i>
<i>more out of her grandmother.</i>

174
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,767
<i>Gambler's intuition!</i>

175
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,019
<i>Here's an explanation of the rules!</i>

176
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:36,065
<i>After making a combo, the player</i>
<i>can choose to stop or keep going.</i>

177
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:36,982
<i>Koi-koi</i>!

178
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,736
Koi-koi<i> means, "I can still make combos!</i>
<i>I'll make more money!"</i>

179
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,571
<i>A declaration of intent.</i>

180
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,908
I'll take Paulownia and Phoenix.

181
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,118
-Now I've got Three Brights.
-3 BRIGHTS: 6 POINTS

182
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,412
I'm done.

183
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,666
<i>Defeat! A sudden defeat!</i>

184
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>Akira was too confident. She didn't watch</i>
<i>which cards her opponent took.</i>

185
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,630
<i>Typical pride.</i>

186
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,050
<i>I let my guard down. But that's not all.</i>

187
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,261
<i>What's amazing is Grandma's power!</i>

188
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,930
<i>The best hand, Three Brights!</i>

189
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,599
<i>Five hands to go. This'll be interesting.</i>

190
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,562
<i>Akira lost by 34 points.</i>

191
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,690
<i>New years gift money, minus 3,400 yen.</i>

192
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,942
Shoko, do you want to play?

193
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,528
…ko…

194
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,322
Shoko…

195
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,493
Avenge me!

196
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,453
Right.

197
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,538
SHUFFLE SHUFFLE

198
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:37,543
If you can get even one point,
I'll cancel Akira's losses.

199
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,920
-Shoko!
-ELATED

200
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,630
<i>Her aura says she has no choice.</i>

201
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,509
<i>Now, Komi vs. Grandma Yuiko.</i>

202
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,512
<i>Their Hanafuda </i>Koi-koi<i> competition began.</i>

203
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,223
<i>Komi first.</i>

204
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,769
Just try to collect cards
with fancy pictures.

205
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,192
<i>_No, Shoko. That is a fancy card but…</i>

206
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,903
-<i>It's the Rain Bright!</i>
-3 BRIGHTS - RAIN BRIGHT

207
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,906
<i>It takes away one point from the Brights!</i>

208
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,367
<i>You should have taken the Cherry Curtain!</i>

209
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,660
Sho…

210
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,622
No talking!

211
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,930
Shoko, you got the Four Rain Brights.

212
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,640
Want to call <i>koi-koi</i>?

213
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,392
-<i>Four Brights with Rain? Wow, Shoko!</i>
-FOUR BRIGHTS WITH RAIN: 8 POINTS

214
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,104
<i>But Grandma only needs one more slip</i>
<i>to make a combo!</i>

215
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,982
<i>You should call it!</i>

216
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,777
Will you do it? <i>Koi-koi</i>.

217
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,236
NOD

218
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,948
DOESN'T REALLY GET IT.

219
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,826
<i>No, Shoko! You'll never win that way!</i>

220
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,663
<i>If you lose after calling koi-koi</i>
<i>you get double points taken off!</i>

221
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,124
Shoko!

222
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,630
-Shoko, you got Five Brights.
-5 BRIGHTS: 15 POINTS BEST, POSSIBLE COMBO

223
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,049
Hmph. You win.

224
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,428
S-Shoko!

225
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,596
SHINE

226
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,974
<i>Komi was surrounded by a bright halo.</i>

227
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,438
MISSION 60
"IT'S JUST NEW YEAR'S."

228
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,275
Happy New Year.

229
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,700
Let's go to the shrine.

230
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,086
BORROWED IT FROM GRANDMA

231
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,381
It looks very nice on you.

232
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,509
Look, look!

233
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,932
-My dad bought it for me!
-YAY!

234
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,768
What a wonderful gift.

235
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,862
-I've still got it, haven't I?
-SPARKLE

236
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,824
Mother?

237
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,129
That's convenient.

238
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,013
BOW TWICE

239
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,973
CLAP TWICE

240
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,559
Shoko.

241
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,314
Did your wish from last year come true?

242
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,154
Is that so.

243
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:56,075
Then, you've got to give thanks.

244
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,669
BOW ONCE

245
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,631
Let's say hello at the shrine office.

246
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,345
G-God has come to Earth!

247
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,556
-<i>Everyone started their year well.</i>
-SHRINE VISITORS

248
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,767
Pardon me.

249
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,228
Oh, Yuiko. Excellent timing!

250
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,689
-One of my staff is out with a cold.
-HEAD PRIEST (63)

251
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,692
We're very busy. What should I do, Yuiko?

252
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,819
Oh.

253
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,954
It'll be a good experience. Go on.

254
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,833
Thank you very much!

255
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,169
Noko, here's our temporary replacement.

256
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,046
Show her how to do it, okay?

257
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,756
Alright!

258
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,218
Okay, come over here.

259
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,514
Basically we add up
the prices of the charms.

260
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,851
Just look at this chart
and take the money.

261
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,770
Are you cold? Use this heater.

262
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,440
I'm used to it, so don't worry.

263
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,696
-<i>It's Komi!</i>
-NOTE: INAKA HAS A SECRET

264
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,658
<i>M-My secret! She knows</i>
<i>I'm a country bumpkin now!</i>

265
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,662
-<i>I-I'll be persecuted!</i>
-PLEASE DON'T THROW POTATOES AT ME

266
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,249
-<i>I can't go to school!</i>
-BUMPKIN! HICK!

267
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,003
<i>If she says, "Inaka?", I'll just say</i>

268
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,754
"Must be my doppelganger."

269
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,215
That's cool! I'll go with that.

270
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,348
HER SOCIAL ANXIETY
PREVENTS HER FROM ASKING

271
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,184
<i>Could it be…</i>

272
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,060
<i>she didn't notice?</i>

273
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,563
<i>What a relief.</i>

274
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,899
<i>As long as she doesn't know.</i>

275
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,609
<i>I'll just stay quiet.</i>

276
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,070
<i>I'll get through this</i>
<i>by not showing my face.</i>

277
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,241
<i>But why is Komi in my little town?</i>

278
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,036
<i>Isn't she a city girl?</i>

279
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,288
-<i>But Komi surely…</i>
-EFFICIENT

280
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,708
<i>I'm sure she can do any job</i>
<i>with speed and efficiency.</i>

281
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,252
<i>Of course. She's Komi after all.</i>

282
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,464
A lucky arrow, a big paper amulet,
safe birth, and traffic safety.

283
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,424
Two big and one small daruma.

284
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,425
<i>Komi?!</i>

285
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,427
-TREMBLING
-<i>I have to help her!</i>

286
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,388
<i>But if I talk to her,</i>
<i>she might figure out my secret!</i>

287
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,352
AMULET PRICE LIST

288
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,233
It's okay.

289
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,069
You can write it down.

290
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,573
Alright?

291
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,414
TOTAL: 6,000 YEN

292
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,250
Oh, okay.

293
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,376
<i>Why did she write it down?</i>

294
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,465
Well done!

295
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,259
Thanks for the help!

296
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,262
Some other girls
are coming in for their shift now.

297
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,429
Thanks.

298
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,267
<i>Work is done.</i>

299
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,894
<i>And I'm done too!</i>

300
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:18,443
THANK YOU FOR TODAY, INAKA.

301
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,612
<i>S-She did figure it out!</i>

302
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:29,329
ALSO, HAPPY NEW YEAR.
LET'S HAVE A GREAT YEAR.

303
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,254
And the same to you.

304

JERK! TWITCH!

310

<i>Komi had always wanted to do that</i>
<i>"humble scratch" move. (It didn't work.)</i>

311
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,785
<i>She still doesn't say a word.</i>

312
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,996
-<i>So awesome!</i>
-<i>A cool beauty!</i>
