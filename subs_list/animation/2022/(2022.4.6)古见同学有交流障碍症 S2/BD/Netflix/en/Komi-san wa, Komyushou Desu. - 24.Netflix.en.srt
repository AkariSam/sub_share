1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,171
MISSION 75
"IT'S JUST WHITE DAY."

2
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>H-Here… I-It's friend chocolate.</i>

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,069
<i>Tadano replayed Valentine's Day</i>
<i>in his head a hundred times a day.</i>

4
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,779
POOF

5
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,782
-MARCH 8
-<i>It's already March.</i>

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>I have to think about White Day gifts.</i>

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,457
THE WRAPPER FROM KOMI'S CHOCOLATE

8
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,961
SNIFF

9
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,213
I-It's not what you think!

10
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,465
Huh? What is?

11
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,434
<i>But what should I give in return?</i>

12
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,229
<i>I hear about candies and marshmallows…</i>

13
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,194
<i>Wow, they have meanings.</i>

14
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:13,656
<i>Candies mean "like."</i>
<i>But marshmallows mean "hate."</i>

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,409
<i>Cookies mean "friends."</i>

16
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,206
<i>This just made it worse.</i>

17
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,753
<i>Should I ask Hitomi?</i>

18
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,298
<i>Yeah, but… no…</i>

19
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,925
<i>Yeah, but… no…</i>

20
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,134
You're distracting!

21
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,139
I was just thinking about
a good return gift for White Day.

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,517
White Day?

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,686
A return gift for your male friend?

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,729
Uh… yeah!

25
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,814
That's it!

26
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,440
What?

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,443
If it's a return gift
for chocolate from a boy,

28
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,320
wouldn't food be alright?

29
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,405
Or you could give chocolate back.

30
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,869
I was thinking of something
a little more substantial…

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,454
-You're in love?
-WITH THAT BOY

32
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,997
N-No!

33
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>Based on his reaction…</i>

34
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,919
<i>And the shadow on that day…</i>

35
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,922
<i>About 165 centimeters tall,</i>
<i>long-haired silhouette,</i>

36
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,050
<i>and the faint footsteps I heard</i>
<i>were close together!</i>

37
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136
<i>My brother…</i>

38
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,471
<i>got some chocolate!</i>

39
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,431
W-What's that?

40
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,768
Fine then. I'll help you
think of something.

41
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,064
NO CUSHION FOR ME…

42
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,650
First, was it friend chocolate?

43
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,110
Or real love chocolate?

44
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,822
Um, friend chocolate. I think.

45
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,948
You think?

46
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,075
That's what I was… told.

47
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,829
It might not be true, though.

48
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,498
I guess…

49
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,709
I mean, no!

50
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,502
I-I don't think that's it.

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,509
If it's true love chocolate,
a gift that lasts would be nice.

52
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,303
-I see.
-You like this person?

53
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,471
I already said no!

54
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,724
Hang on! Choose between "like" or "hate."

55
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,643
Hm? Oh, in that case…

56
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,145
<i>This is about Katai, right?</i>

57
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,564
"Like" I guess… so what?

58
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,817
-Ugh! That's not what I mean!
-What are you talking about?!

59
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,902
Whoa.

60
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,447
Imagine this person clearly in your head.

61
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,198
Listen.

62
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,992
Do you like them?

63
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,338
I suppose… I do have feelings.

64
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,255
-Huh?
-SO CUTE.

65
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,423
Why are you mad?

66
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,927
I understand the situation.

67
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,472
To the department store!

68
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,224
H-Hitomi?

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,435
I saw it on <i>The Noon Show</i>.

70
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,687
Snacks that look good on social media!

71
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,272
Hitomi!

72
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,607
But listen.

73
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,276
Anything is okay from someone you like!

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,527
Don't you think so?

75
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,449
Hitomi!

76
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,952
MOM ONLY KNOWS ABOUT
THE CHOCOLATE FROM A BOY.

77
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,163
<i>March 13, Friday.</i>

78
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,291
<i>White Day falls on a Saturday,</i>
<i>not a school day.</i>

79
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,086
<i>The boys who got chocolate are nervous.</i>

80
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,714
<i>The girls have already</i>
<i>finished their duties.</i>

81
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,549
<i>They're calm and collected.</i>

82
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:23,221
<i>The boys who didn't get any chocolate</i>
<i>have reached enlightenment.</i>

83
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,682
Komi!

84
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,976
Here's your White Day return gi--

85
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,687
Komi! Here's your White Day return gift!

86
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,148
-CANDY SCULPTURE
-Go on and lick your favorite part of me!

87
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,783
T-Thanks!

88
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,998
-HEART RACING
-<i>Anxiety.</i>

89
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,959
<i>N-Next is the return gift for my mentor!</i>

90
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,212
OMINOUS

91
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:05,305
-<i>Muscle mass is all I can offer my mentor…</i>
-<i>HOW TO ATTAIN BEAUTIFUL MUSCLES</i>

92
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,267
<i>D-Does she like it?</i>

93
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,312
<i>And then there's Tadano.</i>

94
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,896
Oh yeah!

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,817
Want to eat something
after school today? My treat.

96
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,777
-Katai.
-BEEF BOWL?

97
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,321
<i>He faltered!</i>

98
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,658
<i>A result of being</i>
<i>too nervous to give Komi her gift.</i>

99
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,995
<i>He told himself,</i>
<i>"T-Today's an unlucky day."</i>

100
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,872
<i>In the end he couldn't do it.</i>

101
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,125
<i>Huh? A date?</i>

102
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,586
<i>That's a date, isn't it?!</i>

103
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>And so Friday the 13th</i>
<i>passed uneventfully.</i>

104
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,926
-MARCH 14, SATURDAY
-<i>White Day.</i>

105
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,471
<i>While everyone else was giving out gifts,</i>

106
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,806
<i>Tadano had faltered.</i>

107
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,769
<i>Now he had no other choice</i>
<i>but to go to Komi's and hand it over.</i>

108
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,274
-Don't stay out too late!
-SMIRK

109
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,569
See ya.

110
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,579
<i>I never thought I'd be this nervous.</i>

111
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>I came to her house.</i>

112
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,168
<i>I… I hope she doesn't</i>
<i>take it the wrong way.</i>

113
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,630
<i>No, I'll just hand it over at the door.</i>

114
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,298
<i>It'll be fine…</i>

115
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,382
<i>It might not be fine.</i>

116
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,634
-Suspicious?
-UNSTABLE

117
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,386
<i>But…</i>

118
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,640
<i>I guess she was…</i>

119
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,059
<i>even more nervous than this.</i>

120
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,103
KOMI

121
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,115
-TADANO IS FALTERING
-<i>I pushed it! I want to run away!</i>

122
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,701
<i>Yes?</i>

123
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,370
<i>S-Someone answered!</i>

124
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,331
-MALE VOICE… HER YOUNGER BROTHER?
-Um, is Komi…

125
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:59,043
Uh, is S-Shoko there?

126
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,254
I-I'm a friend from school.

127
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,506
I-It's uh, Tadano.

128
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,553
-BEEP
-<i>He hung up?!</i>

129
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,891
-W-What's wrong, Tadano?
-MOTHER

130
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,437
-Hello. Is Shoko home?
-TADANO RESPONDED NORMALLY.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,523
Shoko is out on an errand.

132
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,151
Sorry for the bad timing.

133
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,486
Oh, uh, I'll come back later…

134
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,447
Come in and wait!

135
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,659
-Come in and wait!
-Uh… Um…

136
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,623
I'll bring some tea.
Make yourself at home.

137
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,793
Oh, thanks. Don't mind me.

138
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,636
-<i>What should I do?</i>
-SQUIRM

139
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,722
Oh, sor…

140
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,142
<i>Her father?</i>

141
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,817
T-Thank you.

142
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,944
-SITTING
-<i>He's sitting?!</i>

143
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,617
<i>W-What?</i>

144
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,287
-SIP
-<i>Oh, he's drinking it.</i>

145
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,958
-COULDN'T HANDLE THE SILENCE
-M-My name is Hitohito Tadano.

146
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,002
I'm Ko… ah, Sho…

147
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,547
I'm in your daughter's class,
and I study hard every day!

148
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,257
And, uh.

149
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,719
She gave me some friend chocolate
for Valentine's Day.

150
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,721
So I came to give a return gi…

151
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,723
Sir!

152
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,352
BANG

153
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,315
PUSH

154
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,566
TADANO IS FLUSTERED

155
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,573
OPEN CLOSET, SCATTERED BOOKS
CAST-OFF CLOTHES, MESSY BLANKET

156
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:57,328
-BAM BOOM SLAM CRUNCH
-I-It's not that messy!

157
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,832
WHEW

158
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,960
SLOWS HER BREATH

159
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,337
TADANO WATCHES AND WAITS

160
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,588
KOMI CALMS DOWN

161
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,591
ADJUSTS HIS POSTURE

162
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,968
HASN'T CALMED DOWN

163
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,555
TADANO DRINKS DAD'S TEA

164
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,017
TADANO CAN'T FIND A WAY TO START

165
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,271
KOMI KNOWS TODAY IS WHITE DAY.

166
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,735
Uh.

167
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,363
Oh. No. Sorry.

168
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:38,202
This is, uh, thank you
for the Valentines' gift.

169
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,746
H-Here's the return gift.

170
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,173
Go ahead. Look inside.

171
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,175
HAND CREAM

172
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,635
CUTE!

173
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,430
It's not quite the right season anymore.

174
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,183
But I found one
with a nice smell, so I chose it.

175
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,729
-I hope you like it.
-BOW

176
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,908
That's uh… a candy.

177
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,006
W-Well, I'll get going!

178
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,926

Komi.

184
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,674

185
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,556
Komi?

186
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,475

This will be a fierce battle

248
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,763
It has already blown away
the concept of a turn battle!

Hey! That stage!

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,348
Nakanaka is tired!

263
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,100
She exhausted her finger!

264
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,602
Weak constitution!

00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,478
What's that?

266
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,232
Using a finger reinforcement device!

267
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,735
That's cheating! You're a cheater, Najimi!

268

00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,523
-Right here…
-Yeah! You can do it!

274
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,608
-Wow!
-Yes.

275
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,525
I knew it.

276
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,528
Uh, ah, i-is it my turn?

277
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,031
That was not okay.

278
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,283
What should I do?

279
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,328
Yay!

280
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,415
Yay! Third battle!

281
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,417
Don't worry about it!

282
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,670
It's a comeback!

283
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,546
-I'm next!
-No, me!

284
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,757
-Me!
-It is I!

285

Komi?

Are you alright? Do you feel sick?

288
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,858
SORRY. IT'S OKAY. I'M FINE.

00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,151

290
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
Hey, Tadano.

-I have something to do! Bye!
-WHAT ABOUT STUDENT COUNCIL?

292
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,164
Hey!

My ally. Let us meet in battle
another day.

294
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,382
G-Good work again today!

295
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,384
-Bye-bye Komi!
-Kiss me goodbye!

296
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,343
WHACK

297
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,847
-Bye! Take care!
-TODAY I WILL GREET KOMI.

298
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,838
It's raining, huh.

299
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,299
Do you have an umbrella?

300
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,218
I HAVE A FOLDING UMBRELLA.

301
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,511
Oh, good.

302
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,638
I brought one too.

303
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,868
I'm… sad.

304
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,209
There are only a few days…

305
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,420
until the end of year assembly.

306
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,717
A little… over a week.

307
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,930
A-And we'll start with new classes.

308
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,643
This time will end.

309
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,771
And I'm sad.

310
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,027
I understand.

311
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,288
This year has gone by so fast.

312
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,675
At first, you made friends with Najimi.

313
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,136
Najimi says some pretty wild things,

314
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:01,056
but thanks to them, everyone got closer.

315
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,475
They're pretty relentless.

316
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,273
And then you made friends with Agari.

317
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,609
Agari really surprised us
when we went to eat with her.

318
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,904
We should go out to eat together again.

319
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,494
Yamai and Nakanaka are like cats and dogs,

320
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,455
but I think they make a good pair.

321
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:34,006
Onemine and Otori are both so reliable.

322
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,924
They feel so safe.

323
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,385
Like they can take care of things.

324
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,264
On the field trip,

325
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,767
you got to know Kato and Sasaki.

326
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,856
I was glad about that, too.

327
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,277
Sato's morning cleaning.

328
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,614
It's too bad we could only
help towards the end.

329
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,328
She's been doing it all along
and I feel guilty.

330
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,500
It would be nice to hang out
with Maeda and Ushiroda, too.

331
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,923
Sports Day, the Culture Festival…

332
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,175
going shopping, going to the pool.

333
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,177
Going to the festival…

334
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,015
the Christmas party, the snowball fight,
visiting the shrine, and buying fortunes.

335
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,410
The rain isn't stopping.

336
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,375
But it will stop sometime.

337
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,926
It's like…

338
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,013
comparing the rainstorm
while trying to say something profound…

339
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,808
but it was harder than I thought.

340
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,646
Silly me.

341
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,442
Silly you.

342
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,531
-BANG!
-I forgot my eraser!

Let me in your umbrella.

00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,873
HM?

348
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,001
-Don't give me that.
-YOU JUST WANTED TO LEAVE EARLY…

349
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:39,256
Do you want to invite everyone out
after the last day of school?

350
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,299
Yeah!

351
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,218

360
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,182
GOOD MORNING

361
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,404
I…

362
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,491
I hope we…

363
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:36,456
can… have another…

364
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,963
good year.

365
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,256
WHEN A PERSON HAS EXTREME SOCIAL ANXIETY,
THEY STRUGGLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS.

366
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,590
BEAR IN MIND,
THEY ONLY STRUGGLE TO FORM CONNECTIONS.

367
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,967
IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T WANT TO.

368
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,011
