1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,990
At the end of the wandering,
what is on our minds?

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,304
Never fall into the width
and depth of the destiny

3
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:28,864
Maybe it will make tomorrow lost

4
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:31,870
I can't abandon
the irreplaceable present

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,750
I keep yelling to deliver the sound

6
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,640
It gets further every time
I try to catch up

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,648
It gets close when I escape now

8
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:49,630
My hands reach for the transparent
and unseen future

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,100
My hands reach for the days
of laughter and tears

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:01,280
And the end of the cycle

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,700
At the end of the wandering,
what is on our minds?

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,690
Never fall into the width
and depth of the destiny

13
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,600
Turn darkness into wings
and make it float

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,800
I keep going forward for
the sunshine in the front

15
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,952
It'll end soon.

16
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:23,263
"BLEACH Episode 328"

17
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,464
Looks like this might be the place.

18
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,056
Is it Zaraki?

19
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,808
Right.

20
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,679
Is it just going to be you and me?

21
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:07,007
Well, let it be.

22
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,288
But it's not clear that everyone else
has been defeated.

23
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,384
What's so funny?

24
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:31,040
Invading Army had been almost
completely wiped out.

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,904
This is where we will crush
your plot once and for all.

26
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:38,911
Before we do that, answer me a question.

27
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,384
Kageroza Inaba,

28
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:43,007
who are you?

29
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,568
You don't seem to want to answer.

30
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:52,384
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

31
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:55,000
There's only one thing
I want to ask you,

32
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:58,080
are you strong or not?

33
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:03,359
That's pathetic.

34
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,784
I can't believe you haven't noticed yet

35
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,600
you don't even stand a chance.

36
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:16,671
How is it?

37
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,863
So far, we still cannot detect
Mr. Kurosaki's Spiritual Pressure.

38
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,616
Are you saying he's dead?

39
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,560
No, we can't say for sure at this stage.

40
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,160
He's... going to be fine.

41
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,976
How could that Ichigo guy be dead?

42
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:42,240
He's going to be back
out of nowhere anyway.

43
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:43,551
Right?

44
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,888
Don't say so, Kon.

45
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,568
It's no use saying such things.
It's so obvious that

46
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:52,159
you're the one who's
worried about him the most.

47
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
Shut up. What?

48
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,856
I'm not worried about him at all.

49
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:01,792
Kurosaki who has arrived
in the Soul Society

50
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,256
suddenly lost all contact
inside the Dangai.

51
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,560
So the ability of Kageroza is...

52
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:09,530
Oh right,

53
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,704
we know too little about the man.

54
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:15,584
But she

55
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,176
knows a lot about Kageroza.

56
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,050
No, it's more than that.

57
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:23,871
They may have some of the same ideas.

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,912
I will find a way to get Nozomi Kujo.

59
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:31,775
Then

60
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:34,656
you will see my real power.

61
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,712
What does Kageroza mean by that?

62
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:44,192
What kind of mystery
is hidden on her body?

63
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,560
Go mad, Raikuu.

64
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:01,248
What's going on?

65
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:05,664
No Spiritual Pressure
is felt from his Shikai.

66
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:08,832
Does that mean we can't
really know his strength

67
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:12,032
without fighting directly
with his sword?

68
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:15,200
I don't know

69
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,272
what trick you use to hide
your Spiritual Pressure.

70
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:22,176
But at least let me enjoy it.

71
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:23,456
Wait, Zaraki.

72
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:25,888
So impulsive.

73
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,392
Hyoryusenbi!

74
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:37,984
Sorry.

75
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,840
I don't want you standing here
to show off all by yourself.

76
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,056
Cut the crap.

77
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:43,872
It'll all be over if I kill him.

78
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,600
What's wrong, scientist?

79
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:54,592
I don't suppose you showed up
just to get cut off, huh?

80
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,527
Am I still alive?

81
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:22,816
Goodbye, Mr. Ichigo Kurosaki.

82
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:33,632
This is... Dangai.

83
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,232
Damn, I have to...

84
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,768
Who?

85
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:23,072
Scientist,

86
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,952
even two against one
is a slight exaggeration.

87
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:29,690
But maybe are you a little weak?

88
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,672
There's a limit to make
me feel disappointed.

89
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,991
I don't know if that's
your real strength,

90
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,232
but if you don't want to
take the fight seriously,

91
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,860
let me cut you and
end this as soon as possible.

92
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,032
Zaraki, wait!

93
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,976
That guy is waiting for the opportunity.

94
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,112
Guncho Tsurara!

95
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,320
I see.

96
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,672
That's why you're
running around like that.

97
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,688
I remember it.

98
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,190
You're an expert on Dangai.

99
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,080
Right?

100
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:22,176
Creating a portal that wasn't
supposed to be at Dangai,

101
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,512
and then trap someone in the Dangai,

102
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:27,840
that's the power of your Zanpakuto.

103
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,271
That is, being able to manipulate space.

104
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:31,424
What?

105
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:33,504
I thought it was a hell of a move,

106
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:34,912
just a trick.

107
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,640
Boring!

108
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,816
Now that the trick has been exposed,

109
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:41,719
that's not going to work for us.

110
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:49,216
Take it...

111
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,008
I saw right through you.

112
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:53,536
It is bait.

113
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,728
Hyoryusenbi!

114
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,592
Looks like you're good at it.

115
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,408
That should have been my word,
Captain Hitsugaya.

116
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,008
What do you want to say?

117
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:15,872
You're worried that
I'll make another Dangai,

118
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:18,944
so this time you attacked me
from a distance instead,

119
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,695
and changed direction instantly.

120
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:27,840
Is that a compliment?

121
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:30,367
Or you look down on me.

122
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,496
I think I'll leave that
to your discretion.

123
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:37,504
That's right, manipulating the space.

124
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:39,392
As you just said,

125
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:42,432
that's all my Zanpakuto can do.

126
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,752
No matter how you
change the way to attack,

127
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,016
it doesn't matter if you can't hit me.

128
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,888
Yeah, I guess so.

129
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,184
Guncho Tsurara!

130
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,520
Who said anything about
killing you from a distance?

131
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:13,536
Everything had been
prepared for that blow.

132
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,863
Everything had been
prepared for that blow.

133
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,504
What a coincidence!

134
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,768
I just did a little extra preparation

135
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:38,720
for this.

136
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,410
What?

137
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:48,448
What happened?

138
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:52,896
Those were my Guncho Tsurara.

139
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,592
Manipulating the space.

140
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:57,792
That's your verdict on my abilities.

141
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,968
That's true.

142
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,008
But there is a big mistake,

143
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,150
what I can manipulate

144
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,792
is not just limited to the
little world of Dangai.

145
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,680
I could say that I can
manipulate all the space.

146
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,832
What?

147
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:18,432
In other words...

148
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:22,336
Raikuu, the Zanpakuto I use

149
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:26,272
can remember space and restore it.

150
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
By then I had restored the Dangai,

151
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,120
after seeing your attack,

152
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,544
I let it remember that space again.

153
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,648
I don't know if you can
understand what I'm saying.

154
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,312
I can't, it's just a trick anyway.

155
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:49,600
You can't fight if
you don't do the tricks.

156
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:51,968
I'm tired of fighting you.

157
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,968
Just get out of here.

158
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,256
Don't play tricks.

159
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:14,630
This is...

160
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,199
That's right. It's your own slash.

161
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:29,088
Can you even restore
the slash of the Zanpakuto?

162
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:30,719
How do you feel?

163
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,290
The same.

164
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,700
It is my chance.

165
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,576
I saw it.

166
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,410
I saw the way you handled the Zanpakuto.

167
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:55,872
The memory of space is
turning the Zanpakuto to the right.

168
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,200
The restoration is the opposite,
turning it to the left.

169
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:04,256
Just stop you from turning right
and I have nothing to fear.

170
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,100
Check this.

171
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:22,688
I can restore more than one time.

172
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,719
As long as the space has been remembered,
I can constantly restore it.

173
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:42,300
There you are, Kageroza.

174
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,696
Isn't that Captain Soi Fon?

175
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:53,152
I can't believe you could
escape from that boundary.

176
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:56,416
Trapped me in the beginning,

177
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,592
that's a judgment that
deserves my praise.

178
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,160
Of course.

179
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,210
I can control the Punishment Force
as long as I can hold you.

180
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,688
You really take great pains.

181
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:10,040
Master Yoruichi Shihoin.

182
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,480
So you're Kageroza Inaba.

183
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,024
You finally showed up in front of me.

184
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,120
I wonder why I haven't
been able to meet you,

185
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,890
so I see.

186
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,740
It took me a long time to

187
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,870
avoid your men and get Soi Fon out.

188
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,264
I'm sorry to have caused
you any trouble.

189
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,240
But...

190
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,864
it's also something I have to do for

191
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:38,560
keeping everything under my control.

192
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:42,390
Do you really think something
like this could happen?

193
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:44,064
Ridiculous.

194
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:47,970
So do you mean there's
no way I can do it?

195
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:50,944
Don't you?

196
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,550
Don't underestimate my power,

197
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,740
Yoruichi Shihoin.

198
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,856
I don't like to exaggerate my power,

199
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:04,448
but I hate being underestimated
even more.

200
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,336
Since then...

201
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:09,152
so do you, don't underestimate
the other person's power.

202
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,056
Even the two of you...

203
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:25,216
Kuchiki, so you're alive.

204
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,856
Still struggling?

205
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:35,680
There is only one master
in Kuchiki house.

206
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:38,912
Bankai...

207
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,960
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

208
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:47,410
Bankai...

209
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,560
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

210
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,584
I saw

211
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:11,808
your honor as a reigai.

212
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:13,952
I should have said...

213
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:17,469
there is only one master
in Kuchiki house.

214
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:36,750
Let's each stake our honor

215
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:39,424
to destroy your ambition.

216
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:42,900
That's all.

217
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,699
You have nowhere to run now,

218
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,736
Surrender, Kageroza.

219
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,928
What's so funny?

220
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,310
Do you think you can push me over
the edge with this kind of force?

221
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:02,176
You, Original did put up
a wonderful fight

222
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:04,736
against my Invading Army,

223
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,672
even more than I thought it would be.

224
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:12,384
But that's not enough to bring me down.

225
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,136
So much for your nonsense.

226
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,050
What's wrong?

227
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,800
I've recaptured Mr. Kurosaki's
Spiritual Pressure.

228
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,659
Really? Where is Ichigo now?

229
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,149
Can we, Mr. Abarai.

230
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,040
-Okay.
-Tell me.

231
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,408
Good. Let's go.

232
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:40,920
Nozomi, let's go.

233
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,610
I see.

234
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:59,776
The numbers are close.

235
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:01,740
But no one on the other side was hurt.

236
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:03,488
They seem to have the upper hand.

237
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,080
What does it matter?

238
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:09,150
Things are finally starting
to get interesting.

239
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:11,730
It's over.

240
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:16,128
Scatter, Senbonzakura!

241
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,735
Bankai, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

242
00:19:57,856 --> 00:19:59,936
Hurry up, now!

243
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:02,440
Shunko...

244
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:03,840
Don't rush.

245
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:06,950
What?

246
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,024
Take it, Sennen Hyoro!

247
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:16,063
I can't believe you use
Shunko with the Zanpakuto.

248
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,010
That's because he can
copy our moves exactly.

249
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,110
Can you block that move?

250
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,488
Soi Fon.

251
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,384
Yes.

252
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:26,800
Let's end it all...

253
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,192
It's a waste of time.

254
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,439
To cancel the opponent's Kido

255
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:33,370
by crushing it by the opposite spin
Kido in same quality and quantity.

256
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:35,456
Hankisosai...

257
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:54,570
What else do you want to do?

258
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:56,820
Your master has now...

259
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:16,864
You guys make a real team.

260
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:17,920
But I told you

261
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,472
you've been...

262
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,592
You don't stand a chance.

263
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:36,896
I don't know if you can understand that.

264
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,890
What?

265
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,510
What's the matter, third-rater?

266
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,710
Hey, you...

267
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,500
I switched with my pretender
a long time ago.

268
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,192
I can't believe you don't know that.

269
00:21:57,664 --> 00:22:00,224
"To be continued"

270
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,210
I bury my best wishes

271
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,280
Deeply in my heart

272
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:13,190
I hold my breath waiting for
the moment to take off

273
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:19,712
To break free from the cage

274
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,090
I believe the bluebird

275
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,270
That can bring happiness
as in a fairy tale

276
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:40,460
It flies freely in the sunny sky

277
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,500
I hope it overlaps with my wishes

278
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,050
But it disappeared without knowing how

279
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:59,010
Like an ambiguous gesture in a dream

280
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,629
Though I won't forget it

281
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,730
It slips away

282
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,200
Gone like a bubble passing by

283
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,064
Even so

284
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:19,030
I still bury my wishes
deeply in my heart

285
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,940
And hold my breath
waiting as if in a sleep

286
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,140
To break free from the cage

287
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,584
Kageroza Inaba,

288
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,336
why didn't you make the
reigai of Master Yoruichi?

289
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:37,088
No, when she crossed the Senkaimon...

290
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:38,020
Meow.

291
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,872
As you can see, she was in cat form.

292
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:41,248
So I only have the reigai of the cat.

293
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:42,600
Master Yoruichi!

294
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,456
Meow.

295
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,590
Oh my.

296
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:55,219
"Next is the gold version of
the Soul Reapers Illustrations"

297
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,650
Soul Reapers Illustrations.

298
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:02,080
Everyone seems to be fighting already.

299
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,672
Is it right there?

300
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:07,100
Another... me.

301
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:08,831
Chest.

302
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:14,429
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,720
Where are you, my pretender?

304
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:22,528
I think I accidentally forgot to make
the reigai of Lieutenant of Squad One.

305
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,480
Never mind, it doesn't matter.
