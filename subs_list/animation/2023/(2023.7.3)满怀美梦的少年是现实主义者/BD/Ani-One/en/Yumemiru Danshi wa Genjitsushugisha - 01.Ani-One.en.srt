1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,900
Hold on, Aika. Wait for me.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,940
Don't! Don't come any closer!
What an annoyance.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,480
Why are you so mean to me?

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,686
I would not be mean to you
if it were not for your annoyance!

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,160
Huh? Am I that annoying?

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,440
Of course! Stop bothering me!

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,880
I can't stand that.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,780
I can't stand you either.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,880
My name is Sajo Wataru.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,685
I am an ordinary male high school student.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,740
If I have any traits,

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,080
it might be that half of
the people at school

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,660
think I am a stalker.

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,297
Her name is Natsukawa Aika.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,480
I think of her as a perfect goddess

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,745
who has been bestowed by heaven.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,380
I have a strong crush on her

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,340
and hope to date her one day.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,440
So, I keep going after her day after day.

20
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:38,174
Hey, are you okay?

21
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,343
I'm fine.

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,000
All of this happened because
you kept bothering me.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,200
So stay away from me.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,189
You're right.

25
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:55,650
I will do that.

26
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:15,920
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

27
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:32,163
(I like you, please date with me)

28
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,820
-Yesterday's club activity…
-Ah, it went well.

29
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,356
Sajo, good morning.

30
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:39,629
Good morning.

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,740
Sajo, I heard you got your comeuppance
early in the morning?

32
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,640
Comeuppance? Oh, that.

33
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,260
Kei, enough.

34
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:53,520
Keeping doing this will
only make Aika hate you more.

35
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,705
Kei, enough, don't say anything.

36
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:59,500
Hmm, yeah, I think so too.

37
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,340
Sajo, are you sick?

38
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,840
No, I'm fine.

39
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,445
-But…
-Everyone, take your seats.

40
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,775
Oh, Sajo.

41
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:18,080
It is unusual to see you
sitting quietly in your seat.

42
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,419
Is that so?

43
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,400
Yeah, aren't you always
looking at Natsukawa?

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,960
Well…

45
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Hey, you! Stop pestering me.

46
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,798
No, I just wanted to go to the bathroom.

47
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,660
Is that so?

48
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,220
What's wrong with you, Sajo?

49
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,900
What happened between you two?

50
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,580
Did you have a fight?

51
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:09,720
It's nothing. We always fight, don't we?

52
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,123
Well, that's true.

53
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:16,400
But isn't it Natsukawa
who usually gets angry?

54
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:19,187
But no matter how angry she is,
you always pester her, don't you?

55
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,180
-Well, yeah.
-What do you mean by that?

56
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,071
I'm not in the mood for that today.

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,239
I feel odd.

58
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,040
By the way,

59
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,715
can you tell that I like Aika?

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,320
What are you talking about?
Aren't you infatuated with her?

61
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,751
That's true. I adore her and want to
spread the word about her everywhere.

62
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,372
Hey, what is up with
the crush at this point?

63
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,297
Spread the word?

64
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,420
Hey.

65
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,940
Hmm? Are you calling me?

66
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,515
Ah? You must have heard wrong.

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,877
Oh, I see.

68
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,600
Where are you going?

69
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,383
Huh? I'm going to the cafeteria.

70
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,562
-Seriously?
-What's wrong?

71
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:14,800
Usually, you would say,

72
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,040
"Aika, Aika. Let's eat together."

73
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,788
"Your lunch looks delicious today too."

74
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,360
"Are you going to let me have a bite"?

75
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,560
And you just shamelessly pester her.

76
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,654
Just go if you're going to go.

77
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
Or you won't have enough time.

78
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,034
Is he okay?

79
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,040
Is he abnormal
after being rejected so many times?

80
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,719
Hang in there.

81
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,032
How should I put it…?

82
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,260
Hey.

83
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,360
You're Sajo, right?

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,241
You mistook me for someone else.

85
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,890
How could I mistake you for someone else?

86
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,304
Oh! You can actually recognize me!

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,092
I am the well-known Sajo Wataru.

88
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,815
As a reward for recognizing me,
I'll give you this red ginger.

89
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,137
What? I don't want it.

90
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:11,341
So, who are you?

91
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,224
Huh? Oh, it's normal that
you don't know me.

92
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,315
I'm Aizawa Rena from the next class.

93
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:19,840
Aizawa Rena, huh?

94
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,035
Why did you come to see me specifically?

95
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,620
Have a guess.

96
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,909
What a hassle.

97
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:27,120
You're so rude.

98
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,235
Sajo, bye.

99
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,563
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

100
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,289
Sajo. You jerk.

101
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,999
Ouch! I surrender, I surrender!

102
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,378
What are you doing?

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,360
I've already experienced extreme
wrestling games with my sister.

104
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:52,740
Someone is looking for you.

105
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,860
She said she's waiting for you.

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,095
Good morning, Sajo.

107
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,560
You're Aizawa from yesterday, right?

108
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,267
The one who suddenly talked to me.

109
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,940
What do you mean? Don't you like that?

110
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:07,420
Not really.

111
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,025
I was surprised when a cute girl
came up to talk to me.

112
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,575
You already have Natsukawa, don't you?

113
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:16,675
Natsukawa is my goddess.

114
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,119
So what's the deal with this girl?

115
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,302
Um, what do you want from me?

116
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,711
Well, have a guess.

117
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,584
-You jerk!
-Wait a minute.

118
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,378
-Sajo.
-Ah, sorry.

119
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,825
Uh… Aika?

120
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,826
What's up?

121
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:43,969
No, nothing.

122
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm on duty today.

123
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,575
Sajo. You are so popular.

124
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,443
I'll go help Aika.

125
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,367
Oh no, did she misunderstand me?

126
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,619
Hmm… Aizawa?

127
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,394
Just call me Rena.

128
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,610
And then?

129
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,237
-Awesome!
-You're amazing!

130
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,777
Sajo! The ball is coming!

131
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,878
Hey, Sajo! What are you
daydreaming about?

132
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:32,940
Sorry, sorry.

133
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,385
You are so lame.

134
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:44,785
Ashida? What do you want?

135
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:49,000
Nothing. I am just here to say hello
to you, you flirtatious scumbag.

136
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:51,042
Scumbag.

137
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,602
Weren't you chatting
with other girls happily?

138
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,880
No, it's because…

139
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:59,475
But who can resist Aizawa?

140
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:02,261
It seems even you can't resist her charm.

141
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:03,822
Is she famous?

142
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:07,392
Aizawa has a loving boyfriend
in the second grade.

143
00:10:07,392 --> 00:10:08,935
Many people know about this.

144
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,605
According to my intelligence network,
they started dating in junior high.

145
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,550
Intelligence network?

146
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:16,192
Why does it sound so scary?

147
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,195
Ah, but you're really
suitable to be a spy.

148
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,861
Her boyfriend is a year older
than us, in class B Grade 2.

149
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:27,375
He has short hair and
he is quite handsome.

150
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:29,956
How did you get this picture?

151
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,625
Shinomiya is my type!
I want to be scolded by her.

152
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,725
I got you.

153
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:39,050
I also wanted to be scolded by her or have
her stare at me without saying anything.

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,509
By the way, the vice president seems
to be this type too.

155
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,050
Oh, kindred spirit.

156
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,677
-Arimura, how about you?
-As for me…

157
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,140
It should be Natsukawa
in the first grade.

158
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:59,394
What are you thinking
with a straight face?

159
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,150
I am thinking there are all kinds
of people in this world.

160
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,761
I agree.

161
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,675
Why do you look at me when you say that?

162
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,550
Because there's a weirdo
right in front of me.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400
Stop it.

164
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,261
I feel like you've been
a bit strange lately, Sajo.

165
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,869
-What?
-I got it.

166
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:26,100
I suppose you care a little bit
about Aizawa.

167
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,675
You…

168
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,493
But it's true.

169
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,576
I have a question for you guys.

170
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,716
-What is it?
-A question?

171
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:42,095
Sajo.

172
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:46,200
Are you busy now?

173
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:47,535
Sorry to interrupt.

174
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,912
What's the matter?

175
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:55,012
I just wanted to chat with you.

176
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:57,577
So, you don't have anything specific?

177
00:11:58,275 --> 00:11:59,700
Yeah, sort of.

178
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,185
Let's chat then.

179
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:05,875
Why did you break up
with your ex-boyfriend?

180
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,875
Huh? How do you know about that?

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,753
And why do you start by
asking me such a question?

182
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:13,677
Kei.

183
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:15,019
What's the matter?

184
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,300
Anyway, you're already
with Sajo now, aren't you?

185
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,500
Huh? Actually…

186
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,300
Probably because I am not perfect, right?

187
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,325
Really? You're so strong.

188
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:30,050
The guy who dumped you clearly
has poor taste.

189
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,886
But anyway, now you have Sajo.

190
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:37,250
It's right to break up with
that kind of ex-boyfriend.

191
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,600
Kei! What are you talking about?

192
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,050
Because Aizawa is such a good girl,
and he didn't even cherish her.

193
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,625
-It's outrageous! Terrible!
-Don't…

194
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,594
Could you stop criticizing
my ex-boyfriend?

195
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:51,555
Wait.

196
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:02,800
Oh no! Are you okay?

197
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,218
Don't come over.

198
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,547
Sorry.

199
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,075
I'm really sorry about that.

200
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,708
Why are you apologizing to me?

201
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,069
You're right about that.

202
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:25,500
I was not expecting her to be so rude.

203
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,300
Sajo.

204
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,204
You rarely mention Natsukawa around me.

205
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,058
Don't bring up another girl
in front of a girl.

206
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:38,925
That's what I learned from
my dating experience.

207
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:41,200
You have dating experience too?

208
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,886
I don't know if I can count it.

209
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,150
After all, I haven't been very successful.

210
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,436
But you do like Natsukawa, right?

211
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,843
You know that too?

212
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,919
Everyone knows it now.

213
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:54,493
That's true.

214
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,486
But maybe I should give up.

215
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,825
Because I've been rejected too many times.

216
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:02,886
My passion is waning.

217
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,752
Is it? Right.

218
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,100
How about you? Have you ever
been in a relationship?

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,477
Oh, sorry.

220
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,144
I apologized to you for that, and now
I'm asking such a sensitive question.

221
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,734
"She's super cute."

222
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,392
He said so.

223
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,186
So we broke up.

224
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,075
I could tell

225
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:27,276
from what he said was not what he meant,

226
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,657
but I still could not accept it.

227
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,625
Oh, well.

228
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,236
So I decided to let him feel the same way.

229
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,900
That's why I came to find you.

230
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,425
I am indeed overthinking.
It's too bad that it is a waste of time.

231
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,902
A waste of time?

232
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,725
Aizawa, listen.

233
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,643
In fact, before I met Aika,

234
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,300
I was dumped by another girl.

235
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,575
Huh? You?

236
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,511
Yes, it was back in junior high school.

237
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:00,968
"You are not handsome or fashionable.

238
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,243
How dare you say you like me"?

239
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:05,815
Anyway, I was dumped miserably.

240
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:09,750
In the end, her boyfriend
came and beat me up.

241
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,260
Aika walked past me from behind

242
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,425
as the punches sent me flying,
and I fell right into her chest.

243
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,075
Aika slapped me while screaming.

244
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:22,136
-So I fell for her.
-Why?

245
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,069
Aika heard everything

246
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,250
and told them off for me.

247
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:31,250
She said that the worst thing they can do
is make fun of someone's feelings.

248
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,760
From that moment on,
I could only see Aika.

249
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:36,887
I see.

250
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,056
But all that just now was nonsense.

251
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,686
But Aika would definitely do that.

252
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,325
At first, I might have liked her
at first sight.

253
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,586
But what really made me
fall in love with her

254
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:49,927
was how sweet she was

255
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,436
when she first reached out to me.
I will never forget that.

256
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,025
Is it? I see.

257
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,275
After that, I became Aika's supporter.

258
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,075
Huh, supporter?

259
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,375
Natsukawa Aika is the idol of all mankind!
A symbol of hope! A goddess!

260
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,500
So I have decided to spread the word
about Aika's good points!

261
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,400
Hold on, hold on! Sajo.

262
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,819
Don't you want to date Natsukawa?

263
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:16,775
If I keep approaching her,
I'll only bring her trouble.

264
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,150
But that does not mean
I will stop caring about her.

265
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,975
Even if I can't date her,

266
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:24,643
I'll support her in my own way.

267
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,876
From now on,
as the one who's been dumped,

268
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:30,895
I will silently protect
her happiness from afar.

269
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:33,525
Although this might still be
a bit annoying.

270
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,400
It is a bit annoying.

271
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,160
I see.

272
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,700
So there's such a way.

273
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,110
I feel like I've cheered up.

274
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,550
-Although I don't quite understand.
-That's good.

275
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,975
I'll teach Ashida a lesson.

276
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:50,350
No need, no need.

277
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,975
I think Ashida is just
protecting Natsukawa.

278
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:56,350
Protecting Natsukawa?

279
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,625
Yeah, she probably realized
I had ulterior motives.

280
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,169
But I won't do anything weird anymore.

281
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,025
Aizawa.

282
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,550
Actually, not just Arimura,

283
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:10,481
all men have this problem.

284
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,025
I understand.

285
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,893
Morning, Aika.

286
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:20,950
Oh, morning.

287
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,576
Look over there.

288
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,700
That's Rena and her boyfriend.

289
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,502
-They made up.
-It seems so.

290
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,952
Ah, poor thing.

291
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:36,925
I'm talking about Sajo.

292
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,345
He was not only rejected by you,
but he was also dumped by Aizawa.

293
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,025
Yeah.

294
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,919
Ah, what a nice dream.

295
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,175
What's that supposed to mean?

296
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,143
Isn't it great to have a good memory?

297
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:50,478
I knew she had other purposes.

298
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:53,925
I figured I might as well have fun
before she came clean to me.

299
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,442
What's so fun about it?

300
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,750
Every man's ideal type
is a girl like Aizawa,

301
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,300
who looks a little bit naughty

302
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,943
but is actually kind and caring.

303
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,411
Getting to spend time with
such a girl is a reward for me.

304
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:06,787
That's disgusting.

305
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:09,850
Anyway, as everything is settled now,
it is good, right?

306
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,775
You really don't mind?

307
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,600
If I were hated,
that would be another story.

308
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,819
But I never had any expectations
from the beginning.

309
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:20,385
You're really inexplicable.

310
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:23,350
Well, no wonder.

311
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,150
What's wrong with you?
You seem a bit strange.

312
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,000
I feel like I was weirder before.

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,100
What's wrong, Sajo? Why so serious?

314
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,650
Do you feel Natsukawa's hatred now?

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,544
Do not get in the way of
our divorce talks.

316
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:40,975
Divorce?

317
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,675
-What's wrong?
-Have you split up?

318
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,093
Shut up!

319
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,252
Just agree to date me.

320
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:02,075
I'm so stupid.
We're not a good match at all.

321
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,076
Excuse me.

322
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:11,103
Um, you can sit there.

323
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:14,125
I'm sorry for coming to see you suddenly.

324
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:17,011
Oh, it's okay.
How did you know where I live?

325
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:20,152
I found out from the boy
who stayed for club activities.

326
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,697
You must have something to tell me.

327
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:26,910
After all, you would not
just show up at my house.

328
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,081
Well, my house is empty now.

329
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,878
No! I didn't mean anything else!

330
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,626
I know.

331
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,527
What's wrong with you lately?

332
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,286
Huh? Is there something strange about me?

333
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,643
If we are talking about strange,
you have always been pretty strange.

334
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,325
You seem less strange lately,
which makes you stranger.

335
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,689
What does that mean?

336
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,550
You're usually very indifferent.

337
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,727
And you keep coming up to me.

338
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:07,452
In short, you're annoying.

339
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,201
Can't I disagree?

340
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,875
But lately you have stopped pestering me.

341
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,039
You don't follow me like you used to.

342
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:16,511
It's like you suddenly became sensible!

343
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,325
Well, Aika.

344
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:21,296
What's up?

345
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,643
I like you, please date with me.

346
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,650
What? What are you talking about?

347
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:30,702
How could I possibly agree
in this situation?

348
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:32,500
Mm, I knew it.

349
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,425
I'm sorry, Natsukawa.

350
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,850
After all this, you…

351
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:41,950
Anyone would find it disgusting

352
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,194
if a man who has been turned down

353
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:47,194
many times keeps bothering you.

354
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,000
Why are you suddenly saying this?

355
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,175
-It's just…
-I'm back!

356
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,044
I'm so tired.

357
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,900
Hey, get me something to drink.
Wataru brought a girl home!

358
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,843
And she's so cute!

359
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,750
Is this your girlfriend?

360
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,547
No, no.

361
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,694
She just came to talk to me
about something.

362
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:07,575
I'll walk you out.

363
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:08,886
I'll walk you out?

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,960
Don't keep interrupting.

365
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,752
Are you in student council?

366
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,553
Yes, there's just too much work.

367
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,075
I'm sorry about what
the vice president did just now.

368
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,285
I didn't know before.

369
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:34,750
-About just now…
-Huh?

370
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:39,036
What did you want to say

371
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,000
after "it's just"?

372
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,203
You had something to say

373
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,285
before your sister came back, right?

374
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:52,225
I have caused you much trouble.

375
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:56,053
So I want to say that
I won't bother you anymore.

376
00:21:58,227 --> 00:22:02,000
From now on, as an ordinary classmate,
thank you for your help.

377
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,925
What do you mean by that?

378
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,277
In that case,

379
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,575
can you introduce me to anyone
who would get along with me?

380
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,725
What!

381
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,850
You're terrible!

382
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:27,450
Hey, Natsukawa!

383
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:29,100
Irritating, idiot!

384
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,450
KAMIJIAMA, ICHINOSE, AIBE, SUMIYOSHI

385
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,925
SAJO, ASHIDA
Hey, hey!

386
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:50,725
You're not sitting with Aika anymore.

387
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:52,975
Are you sad? You must be sad, right?

388
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:54,977
Ah, it's a bit regrettable.

389
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,452
Rest in peace.

390
00:22:57,452 --> 00:23:00,825
But this way, I won't trouble Natsukawa.

391
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,950
Natsukawa? Trouble?

392
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:08,975
I'm about to give up.

393
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,293
So this is also a good opportunity.

394
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,551
Oh, I see.

395
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,145
But you should take some responsibility.

396
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,099
Huh? Why?

397
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,550
Because you're always
following her closely,

398
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,938
no one else can approach Aika.

399
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:38,619
Right.
I'll spread the word about her then.
