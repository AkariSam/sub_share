1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,570
Because you're always
following her closely,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,580
no one else can approach Aika.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,450
Huh?

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,120
It is all because of you

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,140
that Aika now has only

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,350
me and you to talk to in class.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,960
You also look adorable today.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,460
Is it about time we start dating?

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,500
Not a chance. Go away.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,350
Is it still too early?

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,840
I have no idea what you're talking about.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,010
Again.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,250
Poor Natsukawa.

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,920
But don't you think they go well together?

15
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,810
If she really despised him,
she wouldn't even bother with him.

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,900
Do not worry about it.

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,810
After all, we are not close enough
to interfere in their affairs.

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,620
-Indeed.
-Right?

19
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,280
How could this happen?

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,760
So, if I stop bothering Aika,

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,120
other people will not think twice?

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,760
What are you up to?

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,800
That's right, I'll promote her then.

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,860
Huh?

25
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:32,048
(Please Enjoy This
Spare Chocolate Triangle Pie)

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,670
I feel so lonely without Aika around.

27
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,000
Stop it, Kei.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Indeed,

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,270
I have never seen

30
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,710
Natsukawa get close to anyone
other than Ashida.

31
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,240
Now it might be just right.

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,050
What's wrong, Sajo?
You've been frowning lately.

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,020
No longer going to find Natsukawa?

34
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,120
None of your business.

35
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,640
What about you? Nowhere to go?

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,360
You! Why bring that up?

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,150
It doesn't hurt! Not at all!

38
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,580
So, Natsukawa was concerned for me

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,560
because she did not want to be left out.

40
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,170
Is daydreaming just a waste of time?

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,880
I see, so that's your thought, huh?

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Huh?

43
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,390
The person who scared my junior
yesterday was you, right?

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,370
Oh, this is bad. Can you handle that?

45
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,380
Don't come over.

46
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, it was me. I'm truly sorry.

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,370
I was just kidding.

48
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,460
Why apologize?

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,100
You didn't mean anything bad
when you talked to her, did you?

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,920
But scaring her is still a fact.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,110
Talking to a naive girl
in a deserted place

52
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,380
is a privilege for handsome men
in romance manga.

53
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,980
If I think about it, I should have known
I would scare her.

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,450
Naive…

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,670
Don't be fooled by her appearance.
You should call her senior.

56
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,440
Besides, your actions were commendable.

57
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,510
I am relieved to hear you say that.

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,700
I want to apologize once more.

59
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,960
Then, I'll take my leave.

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Hold on a second.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,340
What's the matter, Senior Shinomiya?

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,740
So, you know me?

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,950
There are very few students
who don't know you.

64
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,970
As an outstanding student council
president, you are quite famous.

65
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,550
Not at all.

66
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,070
So that's how others see me.

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,830
You appear to be self-critical.

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,680
She treated you that way

69
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,420
because she didn't know
how to talk to boys.

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,120
Even if it wasn't her,
I think the result would be the same.

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Wait!

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,860
No, this…

73
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,280
I have something to discuss with you.

74
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,220
Huh?

75
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,070
STUDENT COUNSELING CENTER

76
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,520
Now, I am sure you didn't talk to her
with any ulterior motives.

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,950
Because you don't appear to be
the type to pretend to be serious.

78
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,440
Is that so? Thank you for the compliment.

79
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,560
So

80
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,750
the name of the girl you spoke
with is Inatomi Yuyu.

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,120
She's very diligent and works hard
as a student council member.

82
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Oh.

83
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,790
Not just her, all the other
student council members too.

84
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,560
Everyone is proud of their roles.

85
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
However,

86
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,200
sometimes they lose confidence
and become negative.

87
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,872
After all, losing confidence
when they see your calm

88
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,830
and composed demeanor at work
is natural, is not it?

89
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,190
Stop, stop!

90
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,530
Don't praise me like that.

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,420
So, are you worried
about the other members?

92
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,670
No. Well. Of course, I worry about them.

93
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,370
I believe there is an issue with
my inability to assist them.

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,880
I want to help and solve their problems.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,130
So I tried various ways to encourage them.

96
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,510
But they always respond like this,

97
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,100
"That's something only
the president can do."

98
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,200
Oh, so what it sounds like to you

99
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,190
is that they are saying,
"You can't possibly know how I feel."

100
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,460
So you really care about that?

101
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,360
Y-Yes.

102
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,450
You're really straightforward.

103
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,680
To be honest,
I'm just like the other members.

104
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,540
As a bystander, however, I may be able to
see this more objectively.

105
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Really?

106
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,488
To be frank,

107
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:34,890
they don't really expect
your encouragement.

108
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,020
What?

109
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,590
T-Then, what should I do?

110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,200
Just say, "Don't worry about it,"

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,690
and gently pat their shoulders.

112
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,310
That's enough to satisfy them.

113
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,430
The other members definitely
don't want you

114
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,060
to lower yourself to empathize with them.

115
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
They simply hope that

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,144
you will continue to lead them forward.

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,260
That's it?

118
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,520
That's it.

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,600
To have the respected president
pat their shoulders?

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
They must be overjoyed.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,750
Am I some kind of goddess?!

122
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,360
Maybe to them,

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,200
you're even more revered than a goddess.

124
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,840
Really?

125
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,000
I see.

126
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,990
Sorry for subjecting you to this
during your break.

127
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,810
It's fine. I'm off. See you again
if there's a chance.

128
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,820
Wait!

129
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,140
By the way, I don't even know your name.

130
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,420
My last name is Yamazaki.

131
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,940
Yamazaki.

132
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,180
I still don't think
your kindness is unnecessary.

133
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,550
STUDENT COUNCIL
How could there be kindness that isn't accepted in this world?

134
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,250
Is that so?

135
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,050
If you drop it, you'll see.

136
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,880
What's with all the women this week?

137
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Hey, you.

138
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,090
I made that up, I never thought that way!

139
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,350
Did you talk to that girl afterward?

140
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,410
Huh?

141
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,440
Oh, you mean Natsukawa?

142
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,350
We were just chatting.
After all, we were classmates.

143
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,440
You won't be popular with
girls like that, you know.

144
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,480
Huh? You're telling me this now?

145
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,130
You…

146
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,940
What?

147
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,030
Go have a proper conversation with her.

148
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Good morning.

149
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,080
Good morning…

150
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Good morning.

151
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,530
Good morning.

152
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Hey.

153
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,320
What's wrong?

154
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,760
No, it's nothing.

155
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,990
Oh, I see.

156
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,280
Goodbye, I'm going this way.

157
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,420
Ahhhhhh!

158
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,280
I found Sajo!

159
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,410
No good, no good!
Sajo, you're in big trouble!

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,080
The student council president,
Rin, is furious!

161
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
What?

162
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,470
Alright, don't worry about me,
you go in first!

163
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,536
No way!

164
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:29,400
You're pretending to be a gentleman,
but you're actually forcing it on others!

165
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,540
Then Natsukaga, you go first.

166
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,410
-What?
-Uh, sorry.

167
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Oh no!

168
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,390
Morning, I thought you wouldn't
come to the morning meeting.

169
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,280
M-Morning, Senior Shinomiya.

170
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,720
Good morning, Junior "Yamazaki".

171
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,590
So, Sajo, who calls himself Yamazaki.

172
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,380
Yes!

173
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,980
I will be waiting for you in the Student
Counseling Center during your lunch break.

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Yes.

175
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,960
Let's go, Yuyu.

176
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,740
I've finished my business here.

177
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,990
Yes.

178
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,430
Those are from the student council, right?

179
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,160
What on earth did you do?

180
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,900
Sajo!

181
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,350
You dare to impersonate me!

182
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,960
Give me back my heartthrob!

183
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,650
So that's your type, huh?

184
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,510
Huh?

185
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,840
Senior Shinomiya.

186
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,510
Uh, well.

187
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,290
If I have to say, I guess so.

188
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,570
Great, Yamazaki, she called your name.

189
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, oh.

190
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:35,031
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

191
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,760
Hey, Sajo!

192
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,000
How do you know President Rin?

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,310
It's a long story.
I accidentally gave her a fake name.

194
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,910
Idiot! You wasted a rare chance
to be favored!

195
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,960
What are you talking about?

196
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:51,297
STUDENT COUNSELING CENTER

197
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,050
You don't appear to want to apologize?

198
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,600
Not at all.

199
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,010
I deeply regret not being able
to have lunch yesterday.

200
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,700
So this time I bought two.

201
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,250
Senior, you know what I mean, right?

202
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,000
This one is for you, please.

203
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,820
As you can see, Yuyu is here too, huh?

204
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,130
Please enjoy this spare
Chocolate Triangle Pie.

205
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,330
Spare.

206
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,570
I'm sorry!

207
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,720
Please.

208
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,160
-Anyway, sit down first.
-Yes.

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,620
Alright, Sajo, why did you lie?

210
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,320
Was it just a prank,
or was there a reason?

211
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,590
To be honest,

212
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,680
I think

213
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
student council president
remembering my name will cause problems.

214
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,010
So I subconsciously said
a classmate's name.

215
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,960
I-I see.

216
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm quite hurt.

217
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,168
But,

218
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:58,150
aren't you just pushing the trouble
onto your classmate?

219
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,650
Yamazaki was very happy.

220
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,480
What? Is that so?

221
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,120
No, I don't understand!

222
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,070
Why would someone be happy about something
that makes someone else unhappy?

223
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,880
Uh, well.

224
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,080
Senior Inatomi appears to have grasped.

225
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,430
Ah, yes.

226
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,640
Uh, that.

227
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
Hey, don't do that, you're scaring Yuyu.

228
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm very sorry.

229
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,540
I was just kidding.

230
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,080
Why do you always apologize so easily?

231
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,730
No, in the end, I did scare someone.

232
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,540
Uh, I-I think…

233
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,900
The reason that Yamazaki felt happy

234
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,460
is because Rin is very beautiful.

235
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,312
What? S-Stop joking.

236
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,400
Yuyu, don't join him in making jokes.

237
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,270
I-I'm serious.

238
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,824
Anyway, Sajo,

239
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:59,500
lying about your name is not good.

240
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,860
I'm very sorry.

241
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,440
Mm, don't do it next time.

242
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,750
Yes.

243
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,440
Ah, w-wait!

244
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,920
Sajo, wait.

245
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,376
I didn't call you here for this.

246
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,568
Huh?

247
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,850
Yuyu has been feeling guilty

248
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,360
for rejecting your kindness that day.

249
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,600
So she wants to apologize to you
and formally thank you.

250
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,920
Thank me? But I didn't help you
carry anything.

251
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,380
I… At that time…

252
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,010
I sabotaged your good intentions.

253
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,270
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,640
Mm.

255
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,280
Also…

256
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,780
You saw that I was carrying
something heavy and offered to help.

257
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,640
Thank you!

258
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,520
No, it's nothing.

259
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,960
Um…

260
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,100
I-I will keep working hard

261
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,360
to overcome my fear of men.

262
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,860
Please go for it.

263
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,930
I'll take my leave first.

264
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,570
See you again if there's a chance.

265
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,500
Sajo, Sajo.

266
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,040
-So cute.
-This one too?

267
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,330
Wow, that's a relief.

268
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,720
Great, Natsukawa.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,830
Why are you giving that fatherly look?

270
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,590
Ashida, why don't you join them?

271
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,960
I am going to join them.

272
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,180
What about you?

273
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,310
I will just…

274
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,170
Forget it.

275
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,320
As I thought, am I a stumbling block
for Natsukawa?

276
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,619
Huh? What's this?

277
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:50,820
NEW MESSAGE, KAEDE
Huh? What's this?

278
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,080
NEW MESSAGE, KAEDE

279
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,730
NEW MESSAGE, KAEDE
I only have a bad feeling.

280
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,230
NEW MESSAGE, KAEDE

281
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,200
How old is she now?

282
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,820
Sorry.

283
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,370
What did you say just now?

284
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,060
I was asking how old your sister Airi is.

285
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,920
Oh. Well.

286
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:07,803
AFTER SCHOOL, STUDENT COUNCIL OFFICE

287
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,150
Are you some kind of bossy CEO?

288
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:11,670
…DON'T RUN AWAY, OKAY?

289
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,780
…DON'T RUN AWAY, OKAY?
Well…

290
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,102
…DON'T RUN AWAY, OKAY?
STUDENT COUNCIL OFFICE

291
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,200
So, what do you want me for?

292
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,210
There is a lot of information to organize

293
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,640
for the summer vacation campus open day.

294
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,520
Even if we are just filling numbers,
more people are better.

295
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,720
Come and help.

296
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,680
So I am just here for filling numbers.

297
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,400
I'm sure many people would agree

298
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,250
to the request of the
student council vice president.

299
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,070
Anyway, you're good at
document organization, right?

300
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,870
I will pretend

301
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,980
I did not know you lied about
your age for a job.

302
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,280
So work hard.

303
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,060
What? Is Kaede's little brother
a delinquent?

304
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,930
No, I'm a serious and diligent villager A.

305
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,020
But this is in the city.

306
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,110
You are not a common villager
if you are Kaede's younger brother.

307
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,040
Well, that's true.

308
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,670
That's right.

309
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,460
I will leave the data calculation to you.

310
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,220
Organize the results into three A4 pages
for presentation.

311
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,950
Y-Yes, sir.

312
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,870
Oh, you're doing a good job.

313
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,780
Your previous training wasn't in vain.

314
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,380
I'm very grateful.

315
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,480
See, I told you, right?

316
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,400
Indeed, efficient and accurate.

317
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,320
The layout is also very clear.

318
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,620
No, I'm not that great.

319
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,120
You are not going to call me
over again tomorrow, are you?

320
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,730
Okay, I'll buy you
an adult magazine, alright?

321
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,720
-The big one.
-The big one.

322
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,360
Ahem.

323
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,120
Well, it's not out of the question.

324
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
How disgusting.

325
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,840
Meet at 7:00 sharp tomorrow morning.

326
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,140
Hey, that's a bit…

327
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,580
It already feels like summer.

328
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,600
Ah. Y-Yes!

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,440
Are you thinking about Sajo?

330
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,260
After all, he's a junior.

331
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,160
He's a bit rude, but not rough, right?

332
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
Yeah.

333
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,264
But it seems like

334
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:16,580
I said something that made him angry.

335
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,616
How could that be?

336
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:20,310
Because Sajo had a dissatisfied look

337
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:23,304
in his eyes when he looked at me.

338
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,200
Dissatisfied?

339
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,970
Is it because I said I wanted to
overcome my fear of men

340
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,640
and it made him angry?

341
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,730
Don't worry, Yuyu.

342
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,670
You didn't do anything wrong.

343
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,630
Rin.

344
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Hmph.

345
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,880
Hey, Natsukawa.

346
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,980
Can I visit your house next time?

347
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,160
-My house?
-Your sister is so cute!

348
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,120
Oh, I haven't seen her for a long time.

349
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,960
Uh, do you want to come?

350
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,440
-Yes!
-Thank you.

351
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,880
Let's go buy a cake!

352
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,560
Sajo, Sajo.

353
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,960
We're discussing whether
we should go to Aika's house.

354
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,120
Really? But my level isn't high enough.

355
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,280
Natsukawa's house isn't a dungeon.

356
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,840
There are so many people, is it okay?

357
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,470
I won't let you get close to Airi.

358
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,100
I knew it.

359
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,240
Huh?

360
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,070
128√e980÷2.

361
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,040
What about next weekend?

362
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,672
Um, it should be no problem.

363
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:51,152
Great.

364
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,890
Definitely a melon bun.

365
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,140
Alas.

366
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,720
I really don't want to go…

367
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,990
Hey.

368
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,970
Huh? What's wrong?

369
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,900
Well…

370
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,380
You really won't come?

371
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,520
Huh? Where to?

372
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,720
-My house…
-Hello, Sajo.

373
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,640
You haven't left yet?

374
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,580
I have something to talk to Sajo.

375
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,410
If you guys are discussing something,
you can go ahead and finish first.

376
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,010
No, it's fine.

377
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,200
You guys go ahead and chat.

378
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:34,850
STUDENT COUNSELING CENTER

379
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,440
STUDENT COUNSELING CENTER
So, what's the matter?

380
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,870
STUDENT COUNSELING CENTER

381
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,370
First, I want to thank you.

382
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,650
Because I followed your advice,

383
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,120
I successfully helped Yuyu.

384
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,640
Is that so? That's great.

385
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,440
-But other problems have arisen.
-Oh?

386
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,060
Well, how should I put it?

387
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Yuyu feels like

388
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,536
she hasn't been understood by you,

389
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:56,780
so she's very disappointed.

390
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,370
How could that be?

391
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,170
Her goal is to overcome her fear
of male students, right?

392
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,370
I think it's a great goal.

393
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,370
Yeah.

394
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,280
Ouch.

395
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,800
I want to know your true thoughts.

396
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,040
I'm just disappointed.

397
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,350
Senior Inatomi's determination
isn't enough.

398
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,130
Go on.

399
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,980
The reason Senior Inatomi apologized to me

400
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,700
is not just for me.

401
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,176
It's because she despises herself,

402
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:31,592
her fear of men has ruined
the kindness of others.

403
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,032
That's what I think.

404
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,390
Do you have any objections?

405
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,340
No. On the contrary,
I genuinely admire Senior Inatomi.

406
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,520
The problem is what happened afterward.

407
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,040
Senior Inatomi's words

408
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,000
sounded as if

409
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,030
she was using the incident with me

410
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,300
to proclaim that she was working hard
to overcome her fear of men.

411
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,450
Is that not okay?

412
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,350
Then she shouldn't have brought you over.

413
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,510
STUDENT COUNCIL
If the president is standing by her side,

414
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,540
of course she can be fearless
and courageous.

415
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,390
That's just what I think.

416
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,100
You're really strict.

417
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,990
That's not the case.

418
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,100
Senior Inatomi as a mascot is the best.

419
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,730
I agree.

420
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,800
But you do pay close attention to people.

421
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,750
I used to only focus on one person.

422
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,870
But I won't do that anymore.

423
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,580
Can I go now?

424
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,060
Airi, choose the flavor you like.

425
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,350
Wow! Awesome.

426
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,160
No, the guest should choose first.

427
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,680
Okay.

428
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,400
So cute!

429
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,850
Please enjoy.

430
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,630
My name is Nonoka.

431
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,880
Please, Sis Nonoka.

432
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,540
My name is Takaaki.

433
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,880
Takaki?

434
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,320
-Taka-a-ki.
-Taka-Taka, Takaaki.

435
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,370
-You got it right.
-Yay!

436
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,360
Let's not waste any time and start eating.
