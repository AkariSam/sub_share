00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,990
USED BOOK TRADE

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:14,590
It's so hot.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,290
Let's call it a day for now,
otherwise, we'll end up sweating more.

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,680
Mr. Sajo.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,450
Mr. Sajo.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,720
Really a middle school student…?

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,930
Hello, it's a hot day today.

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,400
Yes.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,670
My hair is all sticking together.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,890
You should be careful
not to have a heat stroke.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,310
It might be too late already.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,240
Sajo.

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,530
ICHINOSE

14
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,010
(In Five Seconds, Your Foot is About to Launch)

15
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,560
She's a middle school student
with the look of a college girl.

16
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,440
She's a high school girl
with the look of a middle school girl.

17
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
I'm starting to get confused.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,280
When it comes to
the Phantom Flowlight series,

19
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,770
Imprisoned Princess of the Clock Tower
has to be my favorite.

20
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,670
I miss that.

21
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,650
Others, like 'The Mobile Armor of the Underground Palace,'
were released simultaneously.

22
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,040
The last chapter
is especially well written.

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,340
I've brought this book with me.

24
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Welcome to the Honey Hotel,

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,510
the one you're looking for.

26
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,600
T-This is… out of print.

27
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,970
Can I really have it?

28
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,130
Of course. Do share your thoughts
after reading it.

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,320
So this is what it's like
when book lovers gather.

30
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,510
I can't believe Ichinose gives off
the impression that she's older.

31
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,240
KEEP IT UP. ARE YOU WORKING?
AMAZING. IT'S ALL UP TO YOU NOW

32
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,360
I HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE JUNIORS NEXT. I'M LEAVING IT TO YOU
It's the campus open day briefing.

33
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,350
That guy is terrible at taking pictures.

34
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm going to save it.

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
KEEP IT UP

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
ARE YOU WORKING?

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
AMAZING

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU NOW

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,370
I HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE JUNIORS NEXT

40
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,370
DO YOU HAVE TIME TODAY?

41
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
As usual.

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,420
Who can understand that?

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,220
-What do you want?
-Coffee, cold one.

44
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,990
Give me.

45
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,240
All right, all right.

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,640
You're really something to hang in there.

47
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,410
I mean your part-time job.

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,370
I heard you've been helping
with Ichinose's sister.

49
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,880
What? Where…

50
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,030
AGAINST VIOLENCE
Where… did you hear that?

51
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,960
Never underestimate my information network
as student council vice president.

52
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,180
What does this have to do
with the student council?

53
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,920
So you heard it
from senior Shinomiya, didn't you?

54
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,480
You're the one who works hard, sis.

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,710
Even though you're the vice president,
I can't believe you can work so late.

56
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,050
You keep complaining
about how annoying it is.

57
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,080
You're such a working slave.

58
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,670
What?

59
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,560
Can't I work hard?

60
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,770
Your foot! In five seconds,
your foot is about to launch.

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
In that regard,

62
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
if you have time to work part-time,

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
could you assist in the preparations
for the campus open day?

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,250
Doesn't each class
already send two people to help?

65
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,160
They are in charge of directing
the junior high students.

66
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,820
This year, however,
there are too many visitors,

67
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,130
so Rin is running out of hands.

68
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,060
Even if the student council
wants to assist,

69
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,080
we are already overburdened
due to the large workload.

70
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,400
Sounds pretty terrible.

71
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,270
Even so, why should I help?

72
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,710
You'll have time
after work in the evening, right?

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,200
I don't want to owe Rin a favor.

74
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,280
Please.

75
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,920
Owing a favor? Is it that exaggerated?

76
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,690
After you rejected Rin,
she's been complaining to me.

77
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,550
You better think of a solution.

78
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,530
I don't think

79
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,620
I'm cut out for a position
on the student council.

80
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,100
Allow me to say no.

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,220
No. I only declined the invitation
to join the student council.

82
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,010
What I mean is
that you should explain to Rin clearly.

83
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,800
Really?

84
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,850
I'm struggling to manage my friend's
relationship with my brother.

85
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,710
Did I unknowingly owe
my older sister many favors?

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,220
You must hate it when someone brings up
this topic when you're busy, right?

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,810
Alright, I'll help, okay?

88
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,030
I'll be there to make my mark.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,690
If you help,
she should be really happy, right?

90
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,320
Obviously, she doesn't want
to be disliked by you.

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,820
Don't say that, it makes it hard for me.

92
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,570
I think to Rin,

93
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,420
you're probably more
than just my younger brother.

94
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,120
Drink it.

95
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,700
Here's your phone.

96
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,060
Hello?

97
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,640
Is this Senior Shinomiya?

98
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,600
Huh? Who are you? Where's Kaede?

99
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,240
She is sleeping next to me.

100
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,280
Don't act like you're my boyfriend.

101
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,590
My ear, my ear!
Stop pulling, it's about to be pulled off!

102
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,680
Sajo? Why are you calling me?

103
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,770
Long time no see, Senior Shinomiya.

104
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,960
I have something to talk to you.

105
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
So I borrowed my sister's phone. Ouch!

106
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,450
I see.

107
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,720
Kaede, let him go.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,380
Sajo said he had
something to talk to me, right?

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,580
My ear on this side
has definitely gotten bigger.

110
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,120
It's become a lucky ear.

111
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,800
The campus open day
is coming up soon, right?

112
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,630
I was wondering
if there's anything I can help with.

113
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,990
What? Is that all?

114
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,480
You don't need to worry about it.

115
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,870
I'll figure out a solution here.

116
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,680
What?

117
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,740
Was I just politely rejected?

118
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,160
Senior, you don't have to be so polite.

119
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,670
Out of my personal interest,
I also want to see you.

120
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,260
What? Personal interest?

121
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,950
What are you saying?

122
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,800
It's nothing,
just consider it a young boy's joke.

123
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,400
But if there's anything
I can help with, just say it.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,420
Um…

125
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,670
To be honest, I'm very grateful
for your willingness to help.

126
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,320
But it's a lot
of manual labor, is that okay?

127
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,280
As long as it's for you,
it's a piece of cake.

128
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,160
What?

129
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,850
DURING THE SUMMER VACATION, THIS DOOR IS NOT OPEN
PLEASE GO TO THE FRONT DESK FOR ANY BUSINESS, STUDENT COUNCIL

130
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,240
Well… Long time no see.

131
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,180
It's been less than a month
since we last met.

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,690
T-That's true.

133
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,270
What is it that
makes you so uncomfortable?

134
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,040
Please continue to treat your junior
with grace and affection as before.

135
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,920
Can I take this to mean

136
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,360
that you want to join the student council?

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,560
That's a different thing.

138
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,680
Did this matter give you such a big blow?

139
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,150
When you broke free
from Yuyu's grip in the canteen,

140
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,640
you held her hand again

141
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,580
before fleeing in terror.

142
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm wondering if my disregard

143
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,240
for your feelings has irritated Yuyu.

144
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,180
Senior Inatomi?

145
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,240
Right, you've always been
concerned about her feelings.

146
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,800
Because this person
likes Senior Inatomi the most.

147
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,140
So you're just
a little uncomfortable with me,

148
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,150
which means you're not too concerned
about our relationship, right?

149
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,810
That's not true.

150
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,680
I even wish you could
become my little brother.

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
Why?

152
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,110
It's manual labor anyway, isn't it?

153
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,040
I can't bear the thought of making
our beloved Senior Inatomi sweat.

154
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,690
Are you really willing to do it?

155
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,370
Why do your words seem prickly to me?

156
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,020
It's just your imagination.

157
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,770
I-Is that so…?

158
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,600
Maybe because she's too straightforward.

159
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
She can't quite catch the joke.

160
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,840
Anyway, it's strange to chat here.

161
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,970
Let's go.

162
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,670
The class representatives
are primarily in charge

163
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,050
of guiding middle school students
on school tours.

164
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,440
In contrast,

165
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,510
the student council is in charge of
moving equipment and setting up the venue.

166
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,870
They are the silent contributors.

167
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,130
That's right.

168
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,560
But the problem

169
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,440
is that most of them are girls.

170
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,360
Although it can be solved if there are
enough people, it is extremely dangerous

171
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,450
for only girls to move things.
I hope to reduce this risk.

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,680
How much assistance can I provide?

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,790
Without saying anything else,

174
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,760
I believe you understand that there are
some things that only you can do.

175
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,750
Regardless of how simple the work appears,

176
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,390
the organizer has responsibilities
and confidentiality obligations.

177
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,250
I believe that if it's you,
there will be no problem.

178
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,160
There is no better opportunity

179
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,760
for girls to see my manly side than this.

180
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,840
You jerk.

181
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,520
Hey… so heavy!

182
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,840
So rude.

183
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,920
Please keep in mind that you are

184
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,760
the Koetsu High School representative
when giving students a tour.

185
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,360
Representative…

186
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,410
CAMPUS OPEN DAY, PRE-BRIEFING
Although it's an unwritten rule,

187
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,840
PLEASE SIT DOWN AFTER YOU GET THE MATERIALS
class representatives are usually good looking,

188
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,440
outstanding students.

189
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,360
But our homeroom teacher picked
those who weren't in any clubs first.

190
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,000
There are such classes, huh.

191
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,150
I see.

192
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,860
Having to rely on
these exceptional students

193
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,960
makes middle school students
yearn for our school.

194
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,320
Very reasonable.

195
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,550
Yeah… Then naturally,
Natsukawa will be here.

196
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,440
With Sasaki?

197
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,980
Although they match well,

198
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,970
it's just too coincidental.

199
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,310
Hey, what's wrong with you?

200
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,170
No, nothing.

201
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,600
What's wrong? Sasaki.

202
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,650
Just now…

203
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,680
No, it's nothing.

204
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,840
STUDENT COUNSELING CENTER

205
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,960
Long time no see, Sajo.

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,360
So our helper is Sajo.

207
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,900
Thank you for helping us.

208
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,170
Hello everyone, I'm glad to join you.

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,880
Recently,

210
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,700
Mina has been talking
about Sajo all the time.

211
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,040
Exactly.

212
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,140
I-Is that so?

213
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,510
That introverted Mina is surprisingly
able to laugh so happily.

214
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,140
Her part-time job
must be very fulfilling, right?

215
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,370
I think so.

216
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,860
Thank you, Sajo.

217
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,660
He's a nice guy,
though as an older brother,

218
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,590
he's a little too spoiled for his sister.

219
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Ichinose is not here today.

220
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,910
He wouldn't lose control
like before, would he?

221
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,980
So,

222
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,930
what should I do?

223
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,470
Oh yes, this…

224
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,020
Firstly…

225
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,960
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,430
There are no more questions, right?

227
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,130
Today is the last day of the briefing.

228
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,150
We are counting on everyone
on the day of the campus open day

229
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,800
Natsukawa.

230
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,460
What is it?

231
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,000
This week…

232
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,230
The soccer club
is having an internal practice match.

233
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,960
Would you like to see it if possible?

234
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,610
I have to look after my sister,
so I'm afraid I won't be able to go.

235
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,500
Oh, right.

236
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,140
Given that you've already invited me.

238
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,690
No, it's nothing.

239
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,410
But, thank you.

240
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,710
You're welcome.

241
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,110
How's Airi lately?
I really want to see her again.

242
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,580
Well…

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
She's doing well.

244
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,620
Natsukawa, are you not going to karaoke?

245
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,260
Everyone said they are going.

246
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
I'm sorry, I have something at home.

247
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,610
-Really?
-What a pity.

248
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,190
Not at all.

250
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,870
We had a feeling it would end up this way.

251
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,840
Goodbye.

252
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,190
Back then,
I didn't have the luxury of time

253
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,700
or the luxury of thought.

254
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,640
The disparity between my classmates

255
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,670
and my own situation,

256
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,270
as well as the self-control
to never feel lost or anxious

257
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,530
in the face of this disparity,

258
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,730
but as the complexities
of this emotion grew,

259
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,100
I was on the verge of a breakdown.

260
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,740
Okay, I'll go right away.

261
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,280
Natsukawa?

262
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,310
Are you okay?

263
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,510
I'm fine.

264
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,970
I cared about him at the time

265
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,560
not because I was gentle and kind,

266
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,950
but because

267
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,820
I saw my own reflection

268
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,160
in his lost and helpless figure.

269
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,280
That's all.

270
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Hello.

271
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,640
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

272
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,290
It's nothing.

273
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,570
I'm Sajo Wataru.

274
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,120
Natsukawa Aika,

275
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,260
your gentleness made me
fall in love with you at first sight.

276
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,910
Will you consider dating me?

277
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,880
I'm sorry,

278
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm not in the mood right now.

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,300
I see.

280
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,790
May I ask why?

281
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,020
Because I am too busy,

282
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,070
so I can't imagine myself

283
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,400
dating someone else.

284
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,000
Too busy? Because of club activities?

285
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,280
I'm not going to talk about myself.

286
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,710
Natsukawa.

287
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Good morning.

288
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,550
I can still go to school with you, right?

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,390
Since then,

290
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,410
he always appeared in front of me.

291
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,760
Natsukawa,

292
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,480
can you help me with this question?

293
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,860
Can I call you by your first name?

294
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,160
Please let me call you
by your first name, please.

295
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,480
Aika, I can help you carry things.
Let's go together.

296
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,870
He's always cheerful, cheeky,

297
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,160
and upbeat.

298
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,130
Why should I teach you?

299
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,760
I refuse.

300
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,010
No.

301
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,820
No matter how cruel I was to him,

302
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,140
his feelings for me
never seemed to change.

303
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,480
Aika, you are the best!

304
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,060
Natsukawa,

305
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,880
I heard that you've been
bothered by a weird boy?

306
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,970
Because you're cute, Natsukawa.

307
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,280
It's inevitable.

308
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,500
- I'll protect you if you're in danger.
- I don't know since when,

309
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,760
classmates often come to talk to me.

310
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,440
Looking back,

311
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,630
chatting with him and others relieved me,

312
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,970
who was on the verge of collapsing.

313
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,030
As the Senior High School
Entrance Examination approached,

314
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,260
he temporarily stopped looking for me.

315
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,610
ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES, EXAM NUMBER

316
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,620
Mom, I passed.

317
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,360
Yes, that's right, great.

318
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,560
Thank you, I'm finally relieved.

319
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,130
Aika,

320
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,630
congratulations on passing!

321
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,240
Could you also congratulate me?

322
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,920
So you are also going to
Koetsu High School too?

323
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,800
I wanted to go to
the same high school as you,

324
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,370
so I studied hard.

325
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,740
Wait. Don't do that!

326
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,180
This isn't junior high.

327
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,560
Is that not allowed?

328
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,140
Of course not.

329
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,700
Then address me by my given name,

330
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,090
not you or Sajo.

331
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,680
You're really weird.

332
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,700
Please.

333
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
I get it. Stop bowing.

334
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,440
Yay!

335
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,900
Natsukawa, you are very popular.

336
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,630
You mean him, right?

337
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,860
He's just pestering me without permission.

338
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,360
Sajo? He's quite humorous, isn't he?

339
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,180
Sajo?

340
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,840
His attitude remained unchanged

341
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,690
after we entered high school.

342
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,960
However,

343
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,060
Kei and other people
began to appear around me.

344
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,970
Despite the fact
that it was not the high school life

345
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,320
I had imagined,

346
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,940
I spent every day relatively fulfilled.

347
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,800
That's what I believe.

348
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,170
Aika!

349
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,100
What? Were you waiting for me?

350
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,810
How could--

351
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,600
Huh? Wait a minute!

352
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,720
What's wrong with you?

353
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,740
Nothing.

354
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,670
What are you planning to do later?

355
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
Go home.

356
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,490
I see.

357
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,670
Right.

358
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,560
Were you thinking of Sajo?

359
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,020
W-Why would you ask that?

360
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,380
Well…

361
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,450
Um…

362
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,120
Sorry, my sister is looking for me.

363
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,760
What's wrong?

364
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,660
THE PART-TIME JOB SITUATION APPEARS TO BE RESOLVED SMOOTHLY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

365
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,680
Wataru?

366
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,920
I've caused you a lot of trouble before.

367
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,850
I came to tell you
that I won't bother you anymore.

368
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,200
Hey, Natsukawa.

369
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,450
So lonely.

370
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,560
What am I saying?

371
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,770
Really, this is nonsense.

372
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,880
What am I thinking about?

373
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,550
Idiot.

374
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
Found you!

375
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,960
Good morning, Aika.

376
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,170
I got it! Just like you said, Aika.

377
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,160
You're really amazing, Aika.

378
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,900
And very cute.

379
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,580
What?

380
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,800
Really…

381
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,460
Ouch.

382
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,720
Na-Natsukawa?

383
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,480
Wataru?

384
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,800
Ouch.

385
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,060
What are you rushing off to so quickly?
