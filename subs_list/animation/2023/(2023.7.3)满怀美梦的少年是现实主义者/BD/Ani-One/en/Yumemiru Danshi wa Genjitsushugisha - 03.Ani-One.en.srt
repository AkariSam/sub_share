1
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,800
Summer, please disappear quickly.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,500
But Natsukawa, please stay.

3
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,720
So cool.

4
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,630
There's air conditioning in the classroom.
I'm so moved.

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,470
Rest well, my sweat glands.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,490
Good morning, Sajo!

7
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,970
What's up?

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,790
Could you not appear in front of me
wearing see-through clothing?

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,440
It's hard on my heart.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,500
Could you not call summer clothes
see-through clothing?

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,860
Pervert.

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,010
What can I do?

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,680
Who made this outfit drop your defense
from 95 to 20 all at once?

14
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,950
Instead of this, shouldn't you be
worshipping someone's summer clothes?

15
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:03,800
Ah! Natsukawa in summer clothes!

16
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,950
Like a fairy frolicking.

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,000
Disgusting.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,040
By the way, Ashida, did you go to
Natsukawa's house over the weekend?

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Do you want to know? Do you want to know?

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,920
What are you being mysterious about?

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,620
Good morning.

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,220
Good morning, Ma'am.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,310
It's time for the morning meeting.
Everyone, please return to your seats.

24
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:13,570
COULD YOU NOT CALL SUMMER CLOTHES SEE-THROUGH CLOTHING?

25
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,880
COULD YOU NOT CALL SUMMER CLOTHES SEE-THROUGH CLOTHING?
That's the end of today's class meeting.

26
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,960
Hey, Sajo!

27
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,120
What is it?

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
What's happened to you?

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,770
You didn't talk to Aika today?

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,690
Huh? We're just normal classmates.

31
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,410
What's wrong with that?

32
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,410
Alas.

33
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,810
Everyone else talks to
Natsukawa normally now.

34
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,940
How can I disturb her?

35
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,790
How is this disturbing?
Don't you really care?

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,820
Hmm, if I stick to Natsukawa like before,

37
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,080
I might disrupt that
harmonious atmosphere, right?

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
That's not true…

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,740
I'm doing this for Natsukawa's sake now.

40
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,700
I don't think so.

41
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,720
And I will not be able to see Natsukawa's

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,680
full-body summer clothes
if I get too close.

43
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,960
You pervert!

44
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,640
-It's really cute.
-Ah? Stop it.

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,280
-Completely perverted!
-What?

46
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,300
-Pervert!
-That hurts.

47
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,360
You're a pervert.

48
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,640
Sajo.

49
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
Hello.

50
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,880
You seem to be doing well
at the soccer club.

51
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,960
It's not bad.

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,680
Are you still fooling around with
Yamazaki these days?

53
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,280
Don't lump me in with him.

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,170
Poor Yamazaki.

55
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,510
Let's not talk about that.
Airi is super cute.

56
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,600
What?

57
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,160
Is this Natsukawa's sister?
She's like an angel.

58
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,180
You're a man with a sister.
You've hit it off so quickly.

59
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,260
Yeah.

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,890
But why didn't you come?

61
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,610
What can I do? Nobody invited me.

62
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,408
SHARE 2 PHOTOS, CANCEL, SEND, DEVICE, OTHER ENDS
Okay.

63
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,178
SHARE 2 PHOTOS, CANCEL, SEND, DEVICE, OTHER ENDS
I'm going to complain to Yuki.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,260
Ah! Idiot, please don't!

65
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,520
Don't save it!

66
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
Here you go.

67
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,020
You underestimate
how much your sister likes you.

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,520
Your sister personally asked me
to report all your actions to her.

69
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,320
Send!

70
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,576
Isn't it great? Having a sister
who's so clingy to her brother.

71
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,750
That was fast.

72
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,750
Thanks for the photos, senior.

73
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,720
I want to become a little girl, too.

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,370
Become a little girl?

75
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,100
Yuki is in junior high school now, right?

76
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,180
If there's any other situation,
please let me know.

77
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,080
She's crazy about you.

78
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
Ah…

79
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,780
Is it that scary?

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,080
Another message.

81
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,340
CHAT LIST, NEW MESSAGE
Ah, it's my big sister.

82
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:24,150
THERE IS NO NEED TODAY

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,350
THERE IS NO NEED TODAY
In comparison, your sister is quite cold.

84
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,890
Hmm, she doesn't usually
interfere in my life.

85
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,740
Speaking of which, I haven't seen
my sister since the weekend.

86
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,170
What's going on? Did you have a fight?

87
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,170
No.

88
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,424
But it's been a while since we've talked,

89
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:39,864
GOT IT
which is unusual.

90
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,840
Sajo!

91
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,090
A wild Yamazaki appeared.

92
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,340
What's up?

93
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,450
Your spirits are still high.

94
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,170
I feel quite down though.

95
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,660
Swapping seats can be harsh.

96
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,910
But at least I've gotten closer to Koga.

97
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,450
Ah? Koga?

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,180
Next time, I want to have sex
with my new boyfriend.

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,152
Really?

100
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,160
You guys know each other well?

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,160
We met through Murata.

102
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,030
Oh, the one from
the girls' basketball team.

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,380
Since you're all alone,
why not join us for lunch?

104
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,360
Hey, this guy also wants to
join us for lunch!

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,080
What? Hey, I was just…

106
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,320
Isn't that Sajo?

107
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,570
What, you also want to join us for lunch?

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,200
Um…

109
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,280
You've been quite obedient recently.
Have you become a loner?

110
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,340
Yeah, yeah, loner.

111
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,910
Look where I'm sitting.

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,930
First row! In the corner! So funny!

113
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,600
It is really funny!

114
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,630
I was being laughed at for no reason.

115
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,400
Speaking of which, what's going on
with you and Natsukawa?

116
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,890
I haven't seen you two quarreling lately.

117
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,490
Yamazaki, how dare you steal my Natsukawa?

118
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,950
I didn't!

119
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,280
So, have you guys had sex?

120
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,000
You two have been like that
since junior high, right?

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,330
Have you? Have you?

122
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,560
Don't be stupid,
I don't even know where her house is.

123
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,600
What? How could you be such a husband.

124
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,450
It's because you lack charm, right?

125
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,030
Sajo is average in everything,
including appearance.

126
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,900
What?

127
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,160
We haven't talked in a while,
and you're getting all snooty.

128
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,440
What about you, Yamazaki?

129
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,400
Of course, I'm super popular.

130
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,050
People confess to me from time to time.

131
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,610
Huh? Who is it?

132
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,360
Don't be scared when you hear it.

133
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,400
It's Okumura from Class A.

134
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,560
So funny!

135
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,700
She's definitely not serious!

136
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,540
Hey, Yamazaki. Please, say something.

137
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,590
By the way, Sajo, what about that girl?

138
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,010
Um? Which girl?

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,750
The one with brown hair.
You guys must have done it.

140
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,530
Oh, Aizawa.

141
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,570
You misunderstood.

142
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,720
Despite her appearance, Aizawa has loved
her boyfriend since school.

143
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Wataru!

144
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,170
What? I'm defending Aizawa here.

145
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,170
Come here.

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,480
Wait, don't just pull me like that!

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,640
So funny!

148
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,360
Hahaha.

149
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,696
MUSIC ROOM

150
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,100
Why is she so angry?

151
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
Na-Na-tsukawa.

152
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,200
Wh-What?

153
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,710
You're angry, right? Let me think.

154
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,640
W-Wait a moment.

155
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,290
What is causing Natsukawa's rage?

156
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,820
I can think of many reasons,
I just don't know which one it is!

157
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:39,958
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

158
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,830
C-Calm down, Natsukawa.

159
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,200
I need to calm down too!

160
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,630
Can you step back a bit?

161
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,780
Right.

162
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,020
What are you most angry about now?
Can you give me a hint?

163
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,440
I don't even know
where to start apologizing.

164
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,110
Because you…

165
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,230
Huh? Me?

166
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,010
Because you were talking to those girls…

167
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Huh?

168
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,730
Those girls? Do you mean Koga
and the others' extraterrestrial army?

169
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,530
So you mean…

170
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,400
D-Don't get me wrong!

171
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,890
That's not what I meant!

172
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,060
Of course I know that!

173
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,910
That's why I don't understand
why you're angry!

174
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,240
B-Because…

175
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,660
Forget it, pretend I didn't say anything!

176
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,250
Hey, Natsukawa!

177
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,040
What's going on? She's too cute like this.

178
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,040
I don't understand,
I don't understand at all.

179
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,030
What's wrong, Sajo?
Your expression is strange.

180
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,080
My expression is always strange.

181
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,160
That's true.

182
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,520
You're not denying it.

183
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm asking you, would Natsukawa

184
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,910
get angry because I was chatting
with Yamazaki, Koga, and others?

185
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,870
Huh? Why would you think
that Aika would get angry about that?

186
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,680
That's what I want to know.

187
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,280
Ah, ah, ah, it's so annoying! Why is it!

188
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,040
No, I need to stay calm.
I can't take it literally.

189
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
Natsukawa didn't say that
because she was jealous.

190
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
Then why did she say such endearing words?

191
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,450
She's so cute, I want to hold her tight.

192
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,500
You've spoken your mind.
But I bet you wouldn't dare to do that.

193
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,780
Of course not.

194
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,460
How could I do such a thing to Natsukawa?

195
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,900
Yes, yes, yes.

196
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,510
Why would the student council president
come to him?

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,900
I won't take up too much of your time.

198
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,110
Could you come with me?

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,990
You can take your time, it's fine.

200
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,380
I don't have anything else to do anyway.

201
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,690
Kei.

202
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,290
Aika.

203
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,400
Um…

204
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,470
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM
Sorry for calling you here so suddenly.

205
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,850
It's okay, do you need my help again?

206
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,760
I'd indeed be grateful,
but this time it's something else.

207
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,280
Oh?

208
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,600
Wataru, how do you see yourself?

209
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,920
Huh? Myself?

210
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,610
Yes, I want to hear your self-evaluation.

211
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,620
I'm just an ordinary person,
just a commoner.

212
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,320
I see.

213
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,800
Have you had a crush on a girl
for a long time?

214
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,560
Huh? How do you know?

215
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,330
Why did you give up?

216
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,770
I have no reason to tell you that.

217
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,480
That's true.

218
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,550
Anyway, you've changed recently.

219
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,730
Yeah, I suppose.

220
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,100
Instead of saying I have changed,

221
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,240
I would say I have simply stopped
doing things that were unnecessary.

222
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,340
I see, I won't pry into the reasons.

223
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,270
But does Kaede know?

224
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,600
My big sister? Why do you ask?

225
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,660
It seems you haven't talked to her.

226
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,700
My big sister is the one who
cares the least about me in this world.

227
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,790
I don't need to tell her.

228
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,430
That's impossible.

229
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,820
In fact, Kaede is confused by your change.

230
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,580
It's impossible.
She is the one who insults me

231
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,710
while asking me to buy her Haagen-Dazs.

232
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,400
How could such a big sister like that…

233
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm talking about your sister.

234
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,290
I don't quite understand
what you're trying to say.

236
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,460
Kaede believes

237
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,500
she is to blame for your change.

238
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,140
She's wondering if she's
ruined her brother's precious youth.

239
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,840
Huh? Why would she think that way?

240
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,410
Wataru, when you were young,

241
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,664
did Kaede ever say something
like this to you?

242
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,100
"That's all you're good for."

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Yeah.

244
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,390
I had a hunch

245
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,350
Kaede was feeling some sort
of guilt toward you.

246
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,860
We've tried to console her,
but it's no use.

247
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,150
That was the first time we had ever
seen Kaede look so sad.

248
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,550
Huh? My big sister?

249
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,270
I don't need to lie to you.

250
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,010
Really?

251
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,540
I got it.

252
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,370
It's a matter about my own family,
I'll find a way to deal with it.

253
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,500
Thank you, I've prepared
a place for you guys.

254
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,190
Huh? Don't bother. A family meeting
like this should be held at home…

255
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,920
Senior, may I ask a question?

256
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,220
What is it?

257
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,390
You told me all this,

258
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,960
is it because you don't want my sister
to continue being sad?

259
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,650
Or is it because

260
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,200
I've made her suffer,
so you're angry at me?

261
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,370
Both.

262
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,920
Are you worried that
you can't have a good talk with Kaede?

263
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,610
No, that's my obstinate big sister.

264
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,920
She definitely won't admit it.

265
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,100
However,

266
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,600
I don't intend to be
as submissive as I once was.

267
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,300
Senior, you're very aware of
your naturally handsome looks, right?

268
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,120
It has taught me
the painful lesson of pride.

269
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,130
When I was at the lowest point in my life,

270
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,570
it was your sister who saved me.

271
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,950
Really?

272
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,320
Then I'll leave it to you.

273
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,160
This is too sudden.

274
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,800
So, she has been avoiding me on purpose.

275
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,410
I really don't want to see
a family member's sad expression.

276
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,270
Even if it's that arrogant sister of mine.

277
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,220
Sis.

278
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
Huh? Why are you here?

279
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,080
Of course, someone called me over.

280
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,670
What about you, Sis?

281
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,270
-Rin called me here.
-Rin?

282
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,900
Oh, the student council president,
Shinomiya. She probably won't come.

283
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,830
Why? Renji said Rin called me.

284
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,860
That's a kind lie from senior Hanawa.

285
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,350
Sis, I heard you're feeling down?

286
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,140
What? Huh?

287
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,230
The student council president, who did not
keep secrets, told me about it.

288
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,240
If I were to just sit and do nothing,
it wouldn't be right.

289
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,180
W-Wait a minute, it's not what you think.

290
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,680
Sis, list ten good things about me.

291
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,720
Huh? What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

292
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,620
Since you're feeling down,
you should be able to say it.

293
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,960
You…

294
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,790
Alright, I'll count down from ten.

295
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,160
Ten, nine,

296
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,920
-eight, seven.
-Huh? Good things.

297
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,600
-Six, five.
-Huh? Good things…

298
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,340
Your good things?

299
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,710
Enough, next.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,640
Tell me ten ordinary things about me.

301
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,180
A-Appearance.

302
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Appearance.

303
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,970
Height! Personality! Body shape!
Intelligence! Wealth!

304
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,780
Wealth?

305
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,190
Hair style! Taste! Physical strength!
Cleanliness! Body odor! Humor! Brotherly love!

306
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,120
-And…
-Stop! You've already said ten!

307
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
See.

308
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,200
Sis, you think I am ordinary too.

309
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,310
N-No, it's because…

310
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,580
Sis, you just told me the truth, right?

311
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,280
So why are you worrying?
It's not like you.

312
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,800
Indeed, I've recently come to terms with
and given up many things.

313
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,500
But all that is

314
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,200
I fell in love with the girl on my own
. And I gave up on my own.

315
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,820
It's not your place to say anything, Sis.

316
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,840
Alright, this is what I wanted to say.

317
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,120
Once, I encountered a similar situation.

318
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
Huh?

319
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,030
On the surface, you may have given up
on the person you like,

320
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,300
but you can't let go in your heart.

321
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,100
Once, a person was crushed like this.

322
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,690
So I'm worried that you'll be the same.

323
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,280
What are you talking about?

324
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,960
If it really becomes like that,

325
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,460
maybe it's me who made you give up.

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,260
Do you think I am a useless man
who can't forget about Natsukawa?

327
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,520
Although sometimes I do belittle you,

328
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,910
but those are all jokes.
You need to have more confidence.

329
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,950
Giving up on a girl you've liked
for so long is a pity.

330
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,190
What?

331
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,190
Well, from now on I'll be careful.

332
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,180
I'll never look down on you again.

333
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,760
And I won't make unreasonable demands.

334
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,920
So, you don't need to be
so self-deprecating.

335
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,680
You've had enough.

336
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
What?

337
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,560
Be careful? Then I can become confident?

338
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,000
That's not what I meant.

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,920
Do you think you've reflected on this?

340
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,520
Even now, do you still want to
be a gentle sister?

341
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,900
A gentle and beautiful older sister

342
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,080
has never appeared in my life.

343
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,730
Indeed, you may have been
a bit harsh to me.

344
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,800
But what's the problem? We're siblings.

345
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,130
Siblings.

346
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,910
You boss me around at will,
and never say thank you.

347
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,510
You always lie on the sofa in
the living room like no one else is there,

348
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,940
playing with your phone and mumbling
like a queen while eating a meat bun.

349
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,490
That's my big sister, right?

350
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,780
Otherwise, I would never admit that
she was my sister.

351
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,840
You…

352
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,060
At least, I like this kind of
big sister the best.

353
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
What…?

354
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,480
I am uncomfortable with your newfound
concern for me. So forget it.

355
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,470
What's the matter?

356
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,170
Are you sure?

357
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,960
This is the last chance for me
to be gentle with you.

358
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,380
Why is it the last time?
You should be gentle on a regular basis.

359
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,840
What? What exactly do you want?

360
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,920
Wait a minute!

361
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,470
How can you talk to
your own sister like that?

362
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,860
Huh? Natsukawa and Ashida?

363
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,320
Apologize to your sister quickly!

364
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,440
Your words are so harsh,
she must feel so upset after hearing them!

365
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,790
Hey, Aika, stop it!

366
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,560
Sajo will die!

367
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,380
What happened? Did you guys see that?

368
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,560
I feel like I just said
something very embarrassing.

369
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,430
It's okay. We only heard
the last few sentences.

370
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,640
I don't believe it.

371
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,750
Are you even listening?

372
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,020
Alright, alright, Aika.

373
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,240
Na-Natsukawa.

374
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
What?

375
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,770
Why are you here?

376
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,810
Because the member of
the student council took you away.

377
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,490
So you deliberately followed
me to the rooftop?

378
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,900
That's just…

379
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,530
Huh? True, why would I do something

380
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,720
that appears to be stalking?

381
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,820
Uh, well, that's just…

382
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,880
A coincidence, that's all!

383
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,120
Aika!

384
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,040
I've been left behind again.

385
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,060
Again?

386
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,950
Was I too naive?

387
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,130
Huh?

388
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,520
It's nothing, stupid Wataru.

389
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,610
What? You're totally
back to your old self.

390
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Humph!

391
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,050
Natsukawa is acting strangely today.

392
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,730
No, no, no.
I have something more important now.

393
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,520
Buy that on the way back.

394
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,400
What are you standing there for?

395
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,400
You should at least say "I'm back."

396
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,750
Yeah, I'm back.

397
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,730
Sorry, Sis.

398
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,080
I said those hurtful things today.

399
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,350
What? You…

400
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,770
I don't want to eat now.

401
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,690
Then I'll have to eat it.

402
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,510
I-I didn't say I don't want it!

403
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,290
It's not delicious when it's cold.

404
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,850
Then I'll eat it now!

405
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,220
Ah! Hey!

406
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,600
Huh? I have no idea
what you're talking about!

407
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,770
Give it back! Hurry up!
Give it back to me!

408
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,150
Hey! Don't eat!

409
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,480
Damn it! In that case!

410
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,360
Ah? Stop it now!

411
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,040
Don't take photo!

412
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,696
Great!

413
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,050
The good-looking guys
on the student council

414
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,120
have probably never seen you so relaxed.

415
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,620
In case of any chance,
I'll sell it to them.

416
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:06,640
You idiot, Wataru!
