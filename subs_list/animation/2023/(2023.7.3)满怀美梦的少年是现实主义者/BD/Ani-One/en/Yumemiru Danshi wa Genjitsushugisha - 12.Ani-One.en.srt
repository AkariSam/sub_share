HONMARU FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,840
Sajo.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,990
Sajo.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up?

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,130
It feels like it's going to rain.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,450
Really?

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,800
Indeed, it's overcast.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,800
It's starting to rain.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,260
Ichinose,

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,140
can you help bring in the cart
from outside?

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,140
O-Okay.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,930
Na-Natsukawa?

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,560
Um…

15
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,410
You better come in.

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,910
Natsukawa.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,530
Here you go.

18
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,010
Thank you, Ichinose.

19
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,440
No problem.

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,030
She seems like a completely
different person, no?

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,670
Indeed.

22
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,730
At first, I thought she was very humble.

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,090
But she's actually a very smart person.

24
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,700
What brings you here today?

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,590
I just wanted to check in
and see how you're doing.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,440
You could have come on
a day with better weather.

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,570
Otherwise, the distance between
you two will only get further.

28
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,350
Will you continue working here?

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,850
No, I'm going to quit soon.

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,570
I'll resign when the summer vacation ends.

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,050
Because that was my plan
from the beginning.

32
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,460
Oh, I see.

33
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,400
Is that okay?

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,040
What do you mean?

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,950
You know…

36
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,800
Ichinose can handle things on her own now.

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,480
It will be okay even if I'm not here.

38
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,300
Hi.

39
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,120
It's about to pour down.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,810
It's Senior Natsukawa.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,430
Hi. You're all wet.

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,580
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

43
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,250
Thank you for guiding
the campus tour back then.

44
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,960
You better dry your clothes first.

45
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,960
Even though I just used this towel.

46
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,060
Fuka?

47
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,320
Senior Mina, today I…

48
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,040
-Over here, come here.
-What's up?

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,870
I'll take care of the shop.
Go ahead and talk.

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
That scared me.

51
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,960
You mean Miss Sasaki?

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,540
She and Ichinose get along great.

53
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,800
She frequently visits Ichinose in order to
discuss their shared reading experiences.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,580
Frequently?

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,920
You seem to get along great with them.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,960
Don't you have to follow them?

57
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,450
How could I leave you here alone?

58
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,460
Natsukawa?

59
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,120
What's wrong?

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,760
N-Nothing.

61
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,920
You don't look fine.

62
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,920
I've said it's nothing.

63
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,590
Why are you so careless?

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,030
Oh, sorry!

65
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,870
We weren't sneaking a peek
or trying to eavesdrop.

66
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,050
Sorry!

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,600
I had previously invited you

68
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,310
to my home. Right?

69
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,640
Yeah.

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,320
But did you come all
this way just to say that?

71
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,020
That's due to…
I just happened to be nearby.

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,910
But you just said you wanted to check in?

73
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,500
Do you need to care about these details?

74
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,960
Sorry.

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm just that kind
of detail-oriented person.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,060
But does the invitation

77
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,580
to your home still count?

78
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,160
How come it doesn't count?

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,470
NIGHT IS SHORT, GO LOVE, GIRL
Because you mentioned many precautions…

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,470
I thought it certainly wouldn't count.

81
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,040
That's because…

82
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,120
-AS YOU WISH! -GEEZ
That's because…

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,840
Because I hope you can
be a good brother to Airi.

84
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,910
Broth--

85
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
No,

86
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,290
that's not what I mean.

87
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,490
Alright, just calm down.

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
Anyway, I sincerely hope you can come.

89
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,480
I'm also looking forward
to the day you visit…

90
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:41,240
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

91
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,020
(Because You Are My Refuge)

92
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,660
The time has come.

93
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,300
What are you up to, Sajo?

94
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,970
Apparel make the woman?

95
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
Zero points.

96
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Aren't I complimenting you?

97
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,420
Wow, I'm so happy.

98
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,620
Wait a minute.

99
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,280
I'm not mentally prepared yet.

100
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,750
Coming.

101
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,560
Negative one hundred million points.

102
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,240
At least say something.

103
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,610
Come on in.

104
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,590
It's Sister Kei and…

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,400
Who are you?

106
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,640
Hello.

107
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,640
My name is Sajo Wataru.

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,990
Nice to meet you.

109
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,840
You can skip the formalities.

110
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,880
Airi,

111
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,620
he is Wataru.

112
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,300
Wataru. Do you know how to say it?

113
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,840
Wataru?

114
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,120
You're so cute!

115
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,500
Is it easier for you to call him Sajo?

116
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,940
Sajo?

117
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,340
Sajo!

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,680
Charge, Sajo!

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,330
Move forward!

120
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,060
Yes, sir!

121
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,600
I should have known better than

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,940
to discount a five-year-old's enthusiasm.

123
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,480
Faster, faster!

124
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,990
You're too slow, Sajo!

125
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,190
Are you okay?

126
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,460
I'm fine…

127
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,520
I want to ride a horse.

128
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,570
Airi, don't be so willful.

129
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,380
Does Airi usually

130
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,920
play such difficult games?

131
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,310
She usually just reads picture books

132
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,050
or plays house.

133
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,520
That's nice.

134
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,440
Airi seems to like you very much.

135
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,190
Huh? Really?

136
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,300
Look.

137
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,900
She usually doesn't
jump on people like this.

138
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,160
Sajo is the second child
in his family, right?

139
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,950
There must be something
they have in common.

140
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,160
Airi is still overly attached to him.

141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,750
You little rascal, watch my comeback!

142
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,480
Take this!

143
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,240
I've never seen Airi so outgoing before.

144
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,320
Is this the power of Sajo?

145
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,590
Oh my.

146
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,420
I had such a great time.

147
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,040
Seeing you tired like that is so funny.

148
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
You're taking her playtime too seriously.

149
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,490
Wasn't it you who said

150
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,880
you hoped I'd be a good brother to her?

151
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,150
Wait, don't say that here!

152
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,550
Brother?

153
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,340
What? What are you talking about?

154
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,840
When I decided to pay a visit
to Natsukawa's home…

155
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
D-Don't talk about that anymore.

156
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,060
Huh? I'm so curious.

157
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,460
Curious!

158
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,360
Kei! And Airi too!

159
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,310
Wow, your big sister is angry.

160
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,900
Airi, come here.

161
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,780
So cute, so cute.

162
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,760
Aika, did you go through
a phase like hers?

163
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,120
In other words,

164
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,300
Airi represents Natsukawa as a child.

165
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,580
Don't think so strangely, okay?

166
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,830
Am I like my sister?

167
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,300
Yes.

168
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,730
The energetic Natsukawa… Hmm…

169
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
You're not thinking
of anything strange, are you?

170
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,540
No, nothing is on my mind.

171
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,840
You're too agitated.

172
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,730
What do you mean, Kei?

173
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,950
Nothing.

174
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,220
Airi, let me ask you.

175
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,160
Do you want a big brother?

176
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,420
A big brother who plays
with you every day.

177
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,650
I want! Big brother!

178
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,280
What are you saying?

179
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,840
Big brother…

180
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,060
Huh?

181
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,770
But I'm talking about a male

182
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,280
who is slightly older than she is?

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,290
Stop it. Kei, you are so naughty.

184
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,860
Sajo, have you rested well?

185
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,720
I've rested.

186
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,400
Then come and play with me.

187
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,120
I have burned out
and turned into white ash.

188
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,140
Aika's mom is back.

189
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,330
What are you doing?

190
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,890
What are you acting cool for?

191
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,110
Welcome home, Mom.

192
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,320
I'm back.

193
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,970
Do we have guests?

194
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,340
-They are Kei and…
-Hello, nice to meet you.

195
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,450
What are you doing?

196
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,630
You are Sajo, right?

197
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,030
I have heard about you from Aika.

198
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,720
About me?

199
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,080
Let me think.

200
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,550
E-Enough, they're going to leave.

201
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,210
What a pity,

202
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,970
I wanted to have a long talk with Sajo.

203
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,180
Sajo!

204
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,520
Um…

205
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,920
Mom!

206
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,270
Y-You can chat next time, right?

207
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,310
That's great, Sajo.

208
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,810
It appears that there will
be a next time. Next time.

209
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,170
I'll send them off.

210
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,910
Alright.

211
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,340
Sajo, come to play again next time.

212
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,040
Airi, be gentler to me next time.

213
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,040
See you next time, Airi.

214
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,220
See you next time!

215
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,290
Airi has grown up.

216
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,520
Has she?

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,600
I see her every day,
so I don't feel anything.

218
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,590
She might grow taller than you soon.

219
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,590
I-I'm still growing too.

220
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,900
By the way, Airi looks a lot like her mom.

221
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,810
Now that you mention it, indeed.

222
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,420
To say it,
Aika probably looks more like her dad?

223
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,070
A beautiful mom and beautiful sister?

224
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,580
Don't say it in such a strange way.

225
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,750
Is this a strange way of putting it?

226
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,160
Is that so?

227
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,280
By the way, Natsukawa,

228
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,120
what have you said about me?

229
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,020
Your mother said
she heard about me from you, didn't she?

230
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,640
I didn't say anything specific.

231
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,380
My house is over here. Bye.

232
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,620
That fellow…

233
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,290
You've walked me far enough.

234
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,040
Thank you, Natsukawa.

235
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,510
Let me walk you a bit more.

236
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,870
Once in a while, anyway.

237
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,210
Huh? Wait.

238
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,030
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

239
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,130
Recently, I've been enjoying school life.

240
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,130
School life?

241
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,900
Now I can chat with other students,

242
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,440
and go out with them.

243
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,600
It makes me say, "This is school life!"

244
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,900
But all this is not a matter of course.

245
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,050
Because this was not the case
when I was in junior high.

246
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,180
Sorry.

247
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,940
It must be all my fault, right?

248
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,980
Not at all.

249
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,570
That's not what I meant.

250
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,860
Even if you hadn't been there,

251
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,530
I wouldn't have had the energy

252
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,460
to enjoy school life

253
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
or talk with classmates at the time.

254
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,430
Because I could only concentrate
on studying at the time.

255
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,870
Are you still awake?
You should sleep early.

256
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,380
I woke up.

257
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,880
Mom,

258
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,080
I plan to apply for Koetsu High School.

259
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,890
They have a tuition waiver policy, right?

260
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,850
What are you talking about?
You don't need to worry about--

261
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,700
And their uniform looks nice.

262
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,890
I see.

263
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,500
But I still feel sorry for you.

264
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,000
I must be a nuisance, right?

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,170
Yes.

266
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,530
But if I could see myself from that time,

267
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,220
I might find it unbelievable
to see my current self.

268
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,600
How is it that I can be so happy now?

269
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,500
I think, the turning point was probably…

270
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,990
He hasn't been bothering you lately.

271
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,520
That's great, Natsukawa.

272
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,780
I was a bit worried.

273
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,890
Everyone knew about my existence.

274
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,130
If it wasn't for this,

275
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,900
I think I would be just like
in junior high school.

276
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,100
That…

277
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,450
Sort of my missionary work.

278
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,590
But I'm still sorry.

279
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,550
Don't apologize to me, Wataru.

280
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,720
I'm capricious.

281
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,850
No, you didn't.

282
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,240
Even if I have a pleasant chat
with Kei and everyone else,

283
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,810
I always feel unsatisfied.

284
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,380
That's true.

285
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,900
Maybe it's a little capricious.

286
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,530
It seems like there's
always one person missing

287
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,070
whenever that feeling comes over me.

288
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,790
And that person is always
a little further away from me.

289
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,020
That's because…

290
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,680
If I joined, I might be in your way.

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,350
Not at all.

292
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,750
Because…

293
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,880
Because…

294
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,290
Because…

295
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,120
you are my refuge.

296
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,870
Natsukawa.

297
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,950
By the way, today…

298
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,580
There's a fireworks festival.

299
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,760
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,310
I'm afraid of loud noises.

301
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,360
Na-Natsukawa?

302
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,030
You don't want to call
my first name anymore?

303
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,400
F-Forget I said that.

304
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,910
B-But…

305
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,660
You should come
and talk to me like before.

306
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,710
If you aren't there,

307
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,740
my life will be out of sync.

308
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,590
Aika looks more childish than usual today.

309
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,260
Because I was worried
about her, even though

310
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,810
Aika was the one who walked me home
at first, I eventually walked her home.

311
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,210
But this might just be my excuse.

312
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,080
I'll leave then.

313
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,580
Thank you, Wataru.

314
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,910
See you next time, Aika.

315
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,280
You really picked a bad time to bother me.

316
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,720
What does it matter?

317
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,850
You're getting used to
the school work anyway.

318
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,220
You'll also be helping out
with the upcoming cultural festival.

319
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,500
I don't want to.

320
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,030
Alright!

321
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,640
Stop inexplicably grabbing
my shoulders and wrists.

322
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,960
It's terrifying.

323
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,380
That violent girl.

324
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,570
She's completely taken advantage of me.

325
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,880
I am not a handyman.

326
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,170
Good morning, Wataru.

327
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
Good morning, Natsukawa.

328
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,410
Huh? What's the matter?

329
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,050
Your tie is crooked.

330
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,050
It's the start of a new term.
You need to be serious!

331
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,280
O-Okay.

332
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,970
And your hair too…

333
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,060
Don't bother with my hair.

334
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,080
Look, it's okay now.

335
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,520
Let's go.

336
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,360
Did you get a haircut?

337
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,920
No.

338
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,890
I-Is that so?

339
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,170
Geez.

340
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,830
Dreams are beautiful, reality is harsh.

341
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,110
From the moment that soccer ball
flew in front of my eyes,

342
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,240
my view became gray.

343
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,020
But unknowingly, it became colorful again.

344
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,510
This may not be a coincidence.

345
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,080
Because recognizing reality,
living each day seriously,

346
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,240
is the answer to getting closer

347
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,032
STUDENT UNION OFFICE
to my dreams.

348
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,460
My name is Sajo Wataru.

349
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,660
I am a common high school boy
being tossed around

350
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,040
by dreams and reality,
without any energy to move forward.

351
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,540
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

352
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,250
My life

353
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,760
will probably continue like this.
