1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,720
Correct, you've mastered it.

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,580
That's it for today's class.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,590
No way. I didn't understand a thing.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,530
What are you doing?

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,380
You didn't understand?

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,780
You did? Let me see!

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,170
Wait, no!

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,440
Hey, Sajo.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,010
Do you want to see mine?

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,960
Thanks, but no.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,280
Little Sajo, are you sure?

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,640
It's none of your business.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,610
That question was really hard.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,900
Yes, I'm a bit worried
about the next exam.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,110
Where are you going?

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,280
Cafeteria.

17
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:29,838
(A Buffet to Celebrate
the End of the First Semester!)

18
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,960
It's too hot outside today.
I hope I can find a seat inside.

19
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,460
Found him, Sajo!

20
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,690
Well, you're looking for
me for something, right?

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,860
Otherwise, I don't think we're familiar
enough to have meals together.

22
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,510
Eh? Is that so?

23
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,290
Why is Yuyu so fond of you? Did you
use some kind of pay-to-win item?

24
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,580
Sajo, you're so cunning.

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,040
You don't even know what that is, senior.

26
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,450
If I could buy such a thing in reality,
I would have bought it long ago.

27
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,330
Oh, that's what it is?

28
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,550
Rin told me you were sick.
Are you feeling better now?

29
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,460
Yes, I'm fine now.

30
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,680
That's good to hear.

31
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,460
About the question you asked earlier.

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,750
There's a reason why Yuyu called for you.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,570
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

34
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,360
Do you want to join the student council?

35
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,670
I'm not talented in that regard.

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,250
The student council president
is retiring this fall.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,740
But we didn't manage to recruit
any boys from the first or second year.

38
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,760
The girls seem to be just here for fun.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Their intentions are too obvious.

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,300
They are clearly using
the student council as a status symbol.

41
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,400
In fact, the only male
member we have is Ichinose.

42
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,940
No, umm… I…

43
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,880
And then we thought of you.

44
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,380
Just like when you advised me,
we hope you can lead the council.

45
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,640
But the structure will only change
in the second semester, won't it?

46
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,610
That's why I hope you
start considering this now.

47
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,920
Has anyone ever asked anything of me?

48
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,960
No, never!

49
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,810
But…

50
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,810
Please, Sajo!

51
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,420
Sajo… you…

52
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Hey… you…

53
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,660
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,360
No, this is a misunderstanding!

55
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,090
Considering this situation,

56
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,300
I really don't think I'm capable
of being on the student council.

57
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,230
Please allow me to refuse…

58
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,240
Your hair…

59
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,360
What… what's wrong?

60
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,330
Why is it messy on one side only?

61
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,880
Ouch!

62
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,290
I can feel your chest!

63
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,630
Gosh, stand still.

64
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,040
Done!

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,400
Um, Natsukawa…?

66
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,430
What is it?

67
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,520
Would 5000 yen be enough?

68
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,710
I… I don't want it.

69
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,840
Drowning and nighttime accidents
are common in August.

70
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,680
Cyberbullying on social
media is also increasing.

71
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,840
I hope you remember that you are a member of this
school and abide by the rules during the holiday…

72
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,960
He is that male student council member.

73
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,530
A bear-like guy who's
popular among the girls.

74
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm Shinomiya,
the student council president.

75
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,290
She is very popular.

76
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,840
No wonder everyone
wants to join the council.

77
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm sure you all know by now.

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,830
The first week of August
will be the campus open day event.

79
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,730
Even though some of you are
not involved in this event,

80
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,670
I hope you remember the character
of a Koetsu High School student.

81
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,660
Character?

82
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,280
Next is the student union.

83
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,960
Looks like my elder sister fits the role.

84
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,690
What kind of magic is this?

85
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,800
I sincerely hope all of you

86
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,100
have a fulfilling and
meaningful summer holiday.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,280
Senior Yuki is still so handsome,
and his voice is still so deep.

88
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,530
No wonder the girls are amazed.

89
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,730
Please be quiet, everyone.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,720
There's one last thing we need to decide.

91
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,640
About the campus open day
during the summer holiday.

92
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
Anyone volunteers to help out?

93
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,040
If no one volunteers,
I will do the picking.

94
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,500
Okay, those who don't have club
activities during the holiday, stand up!

95
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

96
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,790
Sajo, why don't you volunteer?

97
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,000
Yamazaki, shut up.

98
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,470
Sajo, are you willing to help?

99
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,520
Sorry, I just recovered
from a serious illness.

100
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,730
You were fine long ago!

101
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,680
Okay, time for rock-paper-scissors!

102
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,400
We need one boy and one girl,
so you guys need to split up.

103
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,230
Tabata, when was the last time
I talked to you?

104
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,380
-Who knows?
-Let's do this fair and square…

105
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,470
-Hurry up!
-Sorry.

106
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,450
Rock, paper, scissors.

107
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,296
Well, good luck.

108
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:42,048
But I have cram classes to attend.

109
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,040
You should have said it earlier.

110
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,448
Okay, the winner is Ichinose.

111
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,792
And Natsukawa will join too.

112
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:53,024
S-Sorry.

113
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:54,320
It's okay.

114
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,608
Natsukawa is going?

115
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,032
You seem a bit happy about it.

116
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,928
Tabata, I heard you have cram school?

117
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,776
Do you want me to replace you?

118
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,064
Uh… yeah…

119
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:11,496
Ms. Otsuki, can I help?

120
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,032
Really?

121
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:15,640
It would be great if you could come.

122
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,264
But is it okay with your soccer club?

123
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:19,904
The first-years don't need
to compete, so it's okay.

124
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,752
What a guy!

125
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:25,928
-A stunning team.
-So this means that Sasaki…

126
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:29,800
Tabata, is it okay?

127
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:31,248
Ah… yes…

128
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:34,184
Don't worry. I proposed it myself.

129
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:36,080
Tabata, good luck in cram classes.

130
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:37,640
Um, okay…

131
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,224
He's indeed handsome.

132
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,272
Let's work together, Natsukawa!

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,272
Looking forward to it, Sasaki.

134
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:48,672
They seem like a great match.

135
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,288
Um, yeah.

136
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:56,272
Little Sajo… how can you be so calm?

137
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:59,944
Well… they are indeed a good team.

138
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:02,816
You loser.

139
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,360
So, the first semester ends here.

140
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,032
Don't forget the first day of school.

141
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,376
Okay.

142
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,976
Gosh, give me a break.

143
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,096
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

144
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,720
By the way,

145
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:31,400
you almost got to be alone with Aika.

146
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,344
None of your business.

147
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,352
You might experience withdrawal symptoms
if you don't see Aika during the summer.

148
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,344
Maybe.

149
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,688
Club activities are quite tough.

150
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,392
I only get to rest on weekends
and during the Ghost Festival.

151
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:02,360
You don't have to force
yourself to hang out with me.

152
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,376
No, I want to play with you.

153
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:07,632
We can't miss the sea and fireworks!

154
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,984
Oh you…

155
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,704
Sorry to keep you waiting.

156
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,376
Great! A buffet to celebrate
the end of the first semester!

157
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:18,624
Let's eat.

158
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:24,424
Can I invite others to join us?

159
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,408
Sure, the more the merrier.

160
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:31,896
Really? Then… can I invite Sajo?

161
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:36,096
Why… why are you mentioning him now?

162
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,384
You know.

165
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,560
Boss, I've sorted the books.

166
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,392
Really? That was fast.

167
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,312
Hiring you was the right decision.

168
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,224
One more person can
make such a huge change.

169
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:30,144
Thank you for your good work.

170
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,736
I've worked in a convenience store before.

171
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:36,864
This workload actually makes me feel idle.

Don't joke with us!

174
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,728
Give it back to me!

175
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:52,208
You can't touch it, can you?

176
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,088
What do you want, shorty?

177
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,592
Say something.

178
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,288
Hey, stop it.

179
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:08,048
Who are you? You want a beating?

180
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay, you can beat me if you want.

181
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,536
Are you okay?

182
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,792
What… what are you doing?

183
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,504
Are you hurt? Can you stand up?

184
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,840
Let's go. This guy must be an idiot.

185
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,384
-Idiot.
-Idiot.

186
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,160
What's your name?

187
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,320
Sa… Sasaki…

188
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,424
Sasaki Kota.

189
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,552
So it's Sasaki.

190
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,864
Kota, do you remember your home number?

191
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:53,437
BINAN BOOKSTORE

192
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:58,360
I see. You must have been really scared.

193
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,304
But it's okay now.

194
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:01,424
Ko!

195
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:08,904
Sis!

196
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,496
-Are you injured?
-I'm fine.

197
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,784
That's good.

198
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:16,448
And you are…

199
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,432
I was the one who called you.

200
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:20,568
My name is Sajo Wataru.

201
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,576
Kota was being harassed by a group of middle
school students under the overpass over there.

202
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:30,400
Oh… thank you very much, Mr. Sajo.

203
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:39,736
The aura of a big sister! So gentle!

204
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,824
Is this… what a college girl is like?

205
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,248
I've never felt like this before!

206
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:46,984
It's nothing.

207
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,088
More importantly, you should check

208
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,912
if there are strange
traces in his backpack.

209
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,680
Can't let them bully him all the time.

210
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,424
Okay! I got it.

211
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,000
Kota, you should be fine now, right?

212
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,912
Don't go to remote places alone next time.

213
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:08,392
Your sister will worry about you.

214
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,552
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:14,528
You don't need to apologize.
Just be careful next time.

216
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,016
It's great, Kota.

217
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:19,744
A kind big brother helped you.

218
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,496
Ah… it's nothing.

219
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Big brother…

220
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:41,544
Mister, as usual.

221
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,088
Are you a regular at some coffee shop?

222
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,456
Never mind.

223
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,576
So this is the vice president
of our student union.

224
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,168
Shut up, idiot.

225
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,632
Why are you getting up so early
during summer holiday?

226
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:06,832
Because the early bird makes money.

227
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:10,912
You don't make money in school,
but you do at work.

228
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,296
You work in a second-hand
bookstore, right? Is it that easy?

229
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:17,296
This is the good thing
about a private shop.

230
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,304
Unlike those chain stores,
the work won't keep increasing.

231
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:24,312
I just need to finish
what needs to be done.

232
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:33,208
So the student union
is like a chain store.

233
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:34,768
That's not the same.

234
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,944
Is the preparation for
the campus open day going smoothly?

235
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,184
You work together with other departments,
but the student union is still in charge, right?

236
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:45,856
Don't underestimate your big sister.
I didn't become the vice president with nothing.

237
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,176
Apologies for any offense.

238
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:55,040
By the way, were you invited
to join the student council?

239
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:56,504
How did you know…

240
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,368
Shinomiya told you?

241
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,136
Something like that.

242
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,544
What's your relationship with her?

243
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:08,136
Relationship… Like siblings, I guess.

244
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:11,560
I don't care though.

245
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,632
Are you going to join?

246
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:18,488
I've known for a long time
that they want more male members.

247
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,176
Of course not.

248
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,680
The burden would be too heavy.

249
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,392
Then you can join us.

250
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,528
What are you doing?

251
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:29,488
Why?

252
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:34,816
I don't want to give my position
to some loser I don't know.

253
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,016
Clauma…

254
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
I grant you the right

255
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,552
to cheer for the top student,
Shinonome Claudine Marika.

256
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:46,744
Luring Natsukawa to your side
will only make you look worse.

257
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,104
H-How rude!

258
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:52,880
-Any objections?
-No, but I'm also a loser of the Sajo family.

259
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:54,656
Aren't you very good at
organizing documents?

260
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,904
Is that considered a strength?

261
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,512
Anyway, I'm quite serious about it.
Think about it.

262
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,856
Are you really serious?
You must be kidding me.

BINAN BOOKSTORE
SECOND-HAND BOOKS

264
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,504
A masterpiece to read before you die…

265
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:21,760
Isn't that a bit exaggerated?

266
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:25,096
No, it won't attract attention
if we don't write it like this.

267
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:27,696
Excuse me?

268
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:29,808
I'm coming.

269
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,792
Hello, Mr. Sajo.

270
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,880
H-Hello, long time no see.

271
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,264
Thank you for your help last time.

272
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:45,048
We were in a hurry

273
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,544
and didn't realize you worked
in a second-hand bookstore.

274
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:51,024
I didn't know there was
such a store near my home.

275
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,272
Do you live nearby?

276
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,544
Yes! I'm happy to get acquainted
with a bookstore clerk.

277
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,112
I should be the happy one.

278
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:03,848
Miss Sasaki seems very mature.
I can't help but feel nervous.

279
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:06,224
Mature? Not at all.

280
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:09,080
It's the first time
someone said that to me.

281
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:12,928
People always say I'm childish.

282
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,080
No, it's hard to imagine…

283
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:17,936
Uh, it feels a bit like sexual harassment.

284
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,904
Are you going to the campus today?

285
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:23,380
No…

286
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,080
But my school isn't really a campus.

287
00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:29,376
Is that so?

288
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:34,824
Yes, it's only for girls,
so it's not very open.

289
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:36,632
What about you, Mr. Sajo?

290
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,760
Do you know Koetsu High School?

291
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,128
So you're a student there.

292
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,664
Koetsu High School is great!

293
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:49,104
The uniform is also very cute.
It gives me a university feel.

294
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:51,864
It's indeed pointlessly large.

295
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,336
Yes! The school is very
spacious. How nice.

296
00:19:56,656 --> 00:20:00,112
So you're a student at Koetsu.
No wonder you're so outstanding!

297
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,610
Not at all.

298
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,816
In my view, Miss Sasaki is
the mature and flawless one.

299
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:11,304
Well… Mr. Sajo, you're exaggerating.

300
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,632
What's with this vibe?

301
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:16,904
It's too dazzling.
I'm about to be devoured.

302
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:19,568
You saved Kota last time…

303
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:22,824
I want to thank you again.

304
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,496
I did as you suggested
and checked the backpack.

305
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:31,016
There was no damage, so I was relieved.

306
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:33,728
That's good.

307
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,496
How is Kota doing now?

308
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,960
Does he still feel scared?

309
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,568
I think you must have
given him a lot of courage.

310
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,856
He's out playing today.

311
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:46,480
That's really great.

312
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:52,424
Actually… there's something embarrassing.

313
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,328
I haven't really talked to boys much,

314
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:58,336
so now I'm benefiting a lot.

315
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,896
H-how should I put it…

316
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,640
Your parents must love you very much.

317
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,608
That's right.

318
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:08,512
I would say they probably
over-protected me.

319
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,440
I talked too much, sorry.

320
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,144
This is a gift for saving my brother.

321
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,928
A small token of my gratitude.

322
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,432
Thank you. It's not necessary though.

323
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,336
No, I'm the one who should be thankful.

324
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:29,232
Can… can I come again?

325
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,216
O-Of course!

Looking at the size,
it should be a handkerchief.

Is it a high-end one with lace?

329
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:54,528
No, it must be a large
handkerchief for men.

330
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,840
Huh?

331
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,520
Do I…

332
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:07,736
give off a childish impression?
