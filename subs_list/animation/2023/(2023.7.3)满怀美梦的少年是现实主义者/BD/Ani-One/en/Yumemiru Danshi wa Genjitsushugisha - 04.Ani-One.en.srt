1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,144
Aika,

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,144
aren't you being a little impulsive today?

3
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:07,888
Hmm, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,688
It's okay, but why did you do that?

5
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:13,680
I don't know either.

6
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,592
Did you remember our classmates
came to my house a few days ago?

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,824
Yeah, Airi is so cute.

8
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:22,472
Airi was very close to Sasaki at the time.

9
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:25,680
So, I wanted others to…

10
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:27,736
Huh? Is it not good for Airi
to be close to him?

11
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:30,664
It's not that it's not good.

12
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,056
I see.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,976
So, you didn't want it to be like this?

14
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,420
You don't want others
to get ahead of someone

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,005
and get too close to Airi, right?

16
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:43,184
So, did you see Sasaki
and then think of Sajo that day?

17
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:44,976
D-Don't say anymore…

18
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:48,496
Sajo hasn't been looking for you lately.

19
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:51,408
It's like he's trying to hurry you up.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,224
B-But I'm not sure
why I would have such thoughts.

21
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,360
Sajo must be like a safe haven

22
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:01,272
in your heart for you, right?

23
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:03,816
How could he be a haven?

24
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:06,576
He's always pestering me. It's annoying.

25
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,296
I'm not talking about whether
it's comfortable when you're together.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,648
Isn't it nice to be liked by someone?

27
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,672
T-This…

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,824
Anyone would feel insecure

29
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:20,616
if they suddenly lost a safe haven,
wouldn't they?

30
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:23,440
Kei, you see things so clearly.

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,744
But I think these clumsy parts

32
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:28,704
of you are also very cute, so I like you.

33
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,720
Stop it, don't make fun of me.

34
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:32,416
Sorry, sorry.

35
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,424
But Sajo might not

36
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:36,704
always be by your side.

37
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:38,420
At least Sajo has always

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,176
shared his true feelings with you.

39
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,408
He says it every day,
which is so annoying.

40
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:46,820
Isn't it your turn to act this time?

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,100
-Huh?
-Give me a sip. Let's exchange.

42
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,688
-Wait a moment.
-The chocolate flavor is also really good.

43
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,960
(Dark brown? Sounds quite cool)

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,880
You're a bit sloppy.

45
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:34,288
Well, I'm just sloppy.

46
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:36,520
-No, I mean your hair.
-Huh?

47
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:39,744
Wow, it's grown so long now.

48
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:43,376
Your hair is obviously layered,
so you should go dye it evenly soon.

49
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,400
-This is called two-tone dyeing.
-What?

50
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:46,992
Don't you think it's rather fashionable?

51
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:50,936
What are you talking about? This will only
make people think it is dirty.

52
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,584
To look good, light-colored hair
must be dyed with care.

53
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,648
Yeah, I will dye it when the time comes.

54
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:59,168
You used to pay more attention
to your appearance.

55
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,696
Yeah.

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,656
Before, in order to become
a man worthy of Natsukawa,

57
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:07,352
I made all kinds of efforts.

58
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:11,216
Now, I just feel that
caring too much is useless.

59
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:14,328
I'm not trying to get close to anyone.

60
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:20,864
Good morning, Natsukawa.

61
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:23,496
Why are you suddenly so formal?

62
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,304
Do you think I can be the same as usual

63
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:28,632
after what happened yesterday, my goddess?

64
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,440
Good morning, Natsukwa and Ashida.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,472
You just said hello to me
in passing, jerk.

66
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:38,456
Don't kick my calves.

67
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:42,784
Did you guys get home safely yesterday?

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,504
We went to try the new Starbucks drink.

69
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,208
-Right?
-Huh? Yeah.

70
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:49,936
You guys had a lot of fun.

71
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,336
It was especially quiet without you,
which was wonderful.

72
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:54,944
Of course.

73
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,472
After all, it was a girls' gathering.

74
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:00,800
It's so hot, Sajo. Can you fan me?

75
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:04,416
You're good at ordering people around.
I really can't handle you.

76
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,968
This scorching sun is unbearable.

77
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:09,624
Oh my, I don't know
if my sunscreen is enough.

78
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,328
You guys, stop messing around.
It's disgusting.

79
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,480
NO NEED TODAY. GOT IT.

80
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:19,590
YOU DON'T NEED TO COME AND HELP TODAY

81
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:23,504
That is fantastic. I always think it would
be awkward if Senior Yuki was present.

82
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,648
The window seats are usually occupied,
but are they empty today?

83
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,696
Can I sit here? Really?

84
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:47,328
Today at the convenience store, I bought
two nutrition bars instead of one.

85
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:50,584
Again, there are two nutrition bars
and a loaf of bread!

86
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:54,808
I might have a nutritional surplus today,
but I really can't control myself.

87
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:57,672
Look at the back. Are you Sajo?

88
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:05,152
Oh… Hi…

89
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,584
Wait a minute.

90
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:11,608
How come you started eating again?

91
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:16,584
You should normally ask us,
"Is it convenient to share a table?"

92
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,152
No need. Your team is
a little frightening, isn't it?

93
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,264
Whatever way you look at it,
the student council is terrifying.

94
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,136
Who's that angel over there?

95
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:32,248
Please correct yourself,
it's an archangel.

96
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:33,864
You're looking so serious.

97
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,832
Sajo! Come eat with us.

98
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Huh? What?

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,400
Yuyu said so. Did you get it?

100
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,592
Yes.

101
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:46,488
Sajo, what are you eating?

102
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,152
Just a loaf of bread I bought
from the convenience store.

103
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:53,392
Geez. You can't just eat that.
You need to eat something healthier.

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,900
Yes… huh?

105
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,472
-Could it be that you got a boyfriend?
-No way.

106
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,520
My ears, my ears…

107
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,376
They're going to fall off!
They're going to fall off!

108
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,104
No way.

109
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,904
Is this your first time meeting Aya, Sajo?

111
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:13,072
She's my childhood playmate.

112
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:17,272
She is an excellent junior.
She's the one who educated Yuyu so well.

113
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:19,730
-That's really impressive.
-Yeah.

114
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,168
Aya, why are you being so distant?

115
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:24,000
I-I didn't.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,936
Smile, smile quickly.

117
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:29,744
Nice to meet you.

118
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,472
You don't have to force yourself.

119
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:35,688
To be clear, everything I did
was for Yuyu, not for you.

120
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,464
Aya.

121
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:38,650
Listen,

122
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,856
men are perverts who only have lewd eyes

123
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:43,030
for cute girls like Yuyu.

124
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,456
Sajo is not that kind of person.

125
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,780
That's right, because Sajo is a coward.

126
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,608
Senior, can you not say hurtful
things all of a sudden?

127
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:56,320
-It's really good.
-Yeah, looking forward to it tomorrow.

128
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,000
-Humph.
-What's wrong?

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,608
How do you feel seeing Yuyu's change?

130
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,904
Of course, I was shocked.

131
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:05,160
Did you let her play some otome game?

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,224
How could I let her play
that kind of game? Yuyu is my wife.

133
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,048
What about Senior Mita?

134
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,464
She's her mother.

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,728
I see.

136
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:16,592
You didn't tell Senior Inatomi, did you?

137
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:19,184
Do I need to?

138
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,624
Not really.

139
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:23,000
But I thought you would ask me

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,704
to stay away from Senior Inatomi.

141
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:27,736
How could I do something like that?

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,200
I will never abandon my benefactor
who helped me change Yuyu.

143
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,216
What? Benefactor?

144
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes, what's important for Yuyu now is

145
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:41,176
to know that the boys she is afraid of
also have their merits.

146
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:44,120
First, we need such an opportunity.

147
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,376
Opportunity…?

148
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:49,840
Yes, the words you spoke to Yuyu

149
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,024
at the time instilled confidence in her.

150
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,528
Her confidence grew as a result,

151
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:58,152
and she had the courage
to take a step forward.

152
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,928
I didn't do anything significant.

153
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:03,376
On the contrary,
it was a good thing you did,

154
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:06,792
it was just right for her
who's overly negative.

155
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
Whatever the method, you, Sajo,

156
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,216
are the one who provided
Yuyu with this chance.

157
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,960
It was pure coincidence,

158
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,072
and I am not sure I will ever talk

159
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,664
to girls so casually again.

160
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:21,048
It's okay.

161
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:24,456
That won't have any negative impact.

162
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:26,848
Didn't it have a good impact this time?

163
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:29,504
Yes, if we only look at the results.

164
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,544
Be confident, Sajo.

165
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:33,000
Confident?

166
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,208
You not only helped Yuyu,

167
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,064
but you also helped me solve a problem.

168
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,704
Huh? Did I do something?

169
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,160
Yes, I did as you suggested

170
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,256
and patted my junior's shoulder,
saying, "Do not worry about it."

171
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:50,760
Then Yuyu happily leaned on me.
That's really…

172
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,080
Restrain yourself, Senior.

173
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,648
But I had no idea you were
Kaede's younger brother.

174
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:59,464
So you know my sister?

175
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:02,368
Yes, we met in first grade.

176
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:05,440
Is it that time when my sister
decided to dye her hair blonde

177
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,952
on the second day of school
in order to become a hot girl?

178
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:11,368
She really gave me a lot of trouble then.

179
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:14,840
Well, as her younger brother,
I apologize to you on her behalf.

180
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:18,973
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

181
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:24,928
Sasaki? Are you feeling unwell?

182
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,981
BROTHER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

183
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:28,983
ARE YOU CHATTING WITH SOMEONE?
WHO IS WITH YOU?

184
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:32,416
Oh, it's Yuki.
How has she been since then?

185
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,560
I saw her carrying a primary school
backpack when I got home.

186
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,680
No, forget what I said. Anyway, she keeps
sending me these when I'm not home.

187
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,456
Please accept my condolences.

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,344
Who do you think is responsible for this?

189
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,144
NEW MESSAGES, MISSED CALLS
But,

190
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,360
your sister is quite cute like this.

191
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,336
Sajo, you also have a sister, right?

192
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,872
Yes, I have one.

193
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,720
Does she treat you gently
because she's your older sister?

194
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:56,952
Sometimes the relationship is so complex
that it is difficult to put into words.

195
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,048
Great, you understand me so quickly.

196
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,650
Knowing you have such a sister

197
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,520
but still making a move on Natsukawa's
sister is where you went wrong.

198
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,176
Not at all! My target is not Airi!

199
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,768
Whenever there's a limited new product,
I can't resist wanting to try it.

200
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:10,830
Could you step aside for a chat?

201
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,176
Hmm, alright.

202
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,980
I see.

203
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,736
That's your reaction?

204
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,896
I don't meddle in others' affairs.

205
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,520
Is there anyone on this planet
who doesn't like Natsukawa?

206
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:27,368
I don't know about that,
but Sajo, you haven't…

207
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:29,432
It's Natsukawa who needs to
make the decision, right?

208
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,392
I don't have the right to stop you.

209
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:35,744
But I will be super indifferent to you.

210
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,392
You will be indifferent to me?

211
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:41,800
You would dislike a man if he appeared
next to your favorite idol, right?

212
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,728
Sajo, I'm serious about going after her.

213
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:51,368
Why are you so passionate?

214
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:54,464
What is Sasaki worrying about?

215
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,632
Natsukawa is the person
I support the most.

216
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,336
I've always known that
this day would come.

217
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,824
I am not going to fantasize about
an unreachable flower

218
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,168
like Natsukawa having
any story with me any longer.

219
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:07,710
But

220
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,816
I still want Natsukawa

221
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,416
to be with a man who convinces me.

222
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:14,088
Does Sasaki deserve Natsukawa?

223
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:16,256
At the very least,
he doesn't appear to be a bad person.

224
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:20,408
Let me scrutinize you from head to toe.

225
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,944
Sasaki has already won
the affection of Airi.

226
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,544
And he's a handsome guy.

227
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:30,712
I guess I better not get close to

228
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,728
Natsukawa anymore.

229
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,936
Sajo.

230
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:40,536
Can you please return these assignments
from the next class for me?

231
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:42,768
Why me?

232
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:45,192
Because you're the closest, please.

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,512
Alright…

234
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,620
Natsu…

235
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,620
-Natsukawa, did you see that too?
-Yes.

236
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:56,584
Oh. Ashida, help me give
this to Natsukawa.

237
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:59,664
Sajo, why don't you do it yourself?

238
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,552
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

239
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,152
What? Bathroom? Run!

240
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:05,344
Thanks.

241
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,432
Do you need me to do the rest, too?

242
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:16,190
There's no one inside.

243
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,368
I don't need to go.

244
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:37,592
Natsukawa? What's the matter?
You're so cute.

245
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,040
I-I'm not cute.

246
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:42,032
Didn't you just go home with
Ashida and the others?

247
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:43,792
Huh? How did you know?

248
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,210
I just happened to see it.
Did you forget something at school?

249
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,520
Yes, something like that.

250
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,216
Be careful, it's already late.

251
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:54,688
I'll go with you.

252
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,216
Did you find it?

253
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:06,936
Yes, don't rush me.

254
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,272
It's good you found it.

255
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
What's wrong?

256
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:13,400
By the way, I have something to ask you.

257
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,816
Huh? You have something to ask me?

258
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:17,336
I-It's not a big deal.

259
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:20,832
I promised Kei to ask you this today.

260
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,328
What is it?

261
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,224
Wh-Where do you go during lunch break?

262
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,080
Huh? I eat on the courtyard bench at times
and in the cafeteria at other times.

263
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,608
W-With whom?

264
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:34,272
Just me.

265
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:36,128
Why do you eat alone?

266
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:39,960
I mean, isn't it nice to eat with others?

267
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:44,032
Yeah, but today I ate with
the student council members.

268
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,912
Senior Shinomiya, Inatomi and…

269
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:48,928
Senior Shinomiya?

270
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,140
Huh? Yeah.

271
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,150
Why? What's your relationship?

272
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,944
We just met by chance.

273
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,680
What kind of relationship?

274
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,584
Just a regular senior-junior relationship.

275
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:01,272
And she's my sister's friend.

276
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:02,952
I-I see…

277
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,904
What's with this awkward atmosphere?

278
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,690
-What about us?
-Huh?

279
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,768
Can't you eat with us like you used to?

280
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,592
Huh? You mean…

281
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,864
Well, this…

282
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:25,896
Our relationship has changed slightly
as a result of my deliberate distance.

283
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:29,520
In fact, Natsukawa has
made new friends now.

284
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,896
Natsukawa's youth may be jeopardized

285
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:34,488
if I continue to be by her side.

286
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:38,072
Should I support Sasaki's love affair

287
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:40,088
in light of this?

288
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,544
I absolutely don't want to.

289
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,776
Oh no! I mean, I absolutely don't want
to know the final exam results.

290
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:51,230
What do you think about this, Natsukawa?

291
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,584
What are you talking about?

292
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,792
You should do something about your hair.

293
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:07,456
My hair? My sister also said I'm sloppy.

294
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:10,872
First impressions of you can vary greatly.

295
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:13,080
You should do something
about your hair right away.

296
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:15,064
On my way home,
I will stop by the cosmetics store.

297
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,664
Which do you think looks better,
black or brown hair?

298
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:21,504
That varies from person to person.

299
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:25,784
True, which do you think looks better?
Brown or black hair?

300
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:27,384
Huh? Didn't I just…

301
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:29,408
Wasn't that a general opinion?

302
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:32,872
What I want to know is
what you personally think, Natsukawa.

303
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:37,416
You're just irresistible, Natsukawa.

304
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,664
Ahh. The fragrance coming from her body.

305
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:42,088
-Hmm.
-H-How is it?

306
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:43,760
I think either one is fine.

307
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:45,380
You can't answer just like that.

308
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,752
-Ah, but…
-Hmm?

309
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,864
If you had brown hair back then,
I probably wouldn't have talked to you.

310
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:53,776
Back then?

311
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:01,280
Then I'll dye it according to
Natsukawa's preference.

312
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,528
I-It's not exactly a preference.

313
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:06,536
I'm fine with any color.

314
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,472
Did you hear that?
That's not my preference.

315
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:11,768
I got it.

316
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:15,480
Wow, there's no black left.

317
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,320
Dark brown?

318
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:20,112
Sounds pretty cool.

319
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,504
Do I have to stay still like this
for twenty minutes?

320
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:28,864
It stinks. Didn't I tell you
to close the door?

321
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,288
I can't touch the doorknob because
my gloves are covered in hair dye cream.

322
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:32,800
Dark brown?

323
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,744
Since there was no black, I chose this.

324
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:39,200
That's pretty good,
it's super black when you first dye it.

325
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:40,616
Really?

326
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:42,736
The dyeing is so bad, it's not even.

327
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:45,016
Get out of the way.

328
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:47,040
Thank you…

329
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,376
Hmm? Rubber gloves? I have a bad feeling.

330
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,216
-Ah, wait!
-I asked you

331
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:53,272
not to be so careless with your hair dye.

332
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,256
It hurts, don't rub so hard,
you are ripping out my hair!

333
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:59,416
-Your hair won't fall out.
-It hurts!

334
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,240
-How is it?
-Hmm, hmm…

335
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,584
Isn't it a little too black?

336
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:05,640
Didn't I just say it?
It will be this black for now.

337
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:07,800
But as long as you shampoo hard,

338
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,288
it'll feel natural in a couple of days.

339
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,968
You are indeed a former blonde hottie.

340
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll hit you.

341
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,616
FIRST SEMESTER, END-OF-TERM EXAM, RANK
Enthusiasm.

342
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:22,568
It's constantly
affecting everyone's motivation.

343
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:27,608
Children run around outside with
enthusiasm gushing out of their bodies.

344
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,392
Some junior high students try to fulfill
their enigmatic dreams.

345
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:36,072
Then people go through adolescence
and fall in love,

346
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:40,280
thinking about the person they admire
and boiling with enthusiasm.

347
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,536
Then sublimation into
their own motivation! Especially for boys.

348
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:47,832
In short, what I want to express is,

349
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,632
falling in love is quite amazing.

350
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,840
I ranked 32nd in the midterm exam.

351
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,712
I know why I regressed.

352
00:18:56,984 --> 00:19:00,520
I had a steely determination at the time
to catch up with Natsukawa no matter what.

353
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,848
Furthermore, our school's college
entrance rate was previously very high.

354
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,100
If it wasn't for my obsession
with Natsukawa,

355
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,960
I wouldn't have been able to get
into this kind of school.

356
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,050
In other words, hmm…

357
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,856
Compared to the last time,

358
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:16,350
this time I clearly lacked enthusiasm
for studying.

359
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,784
Sajo, what's your rank?

360
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Did you crumple the paper?

361
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,128
Sorry, sorry.

362
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,208
I am 74th.

363
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:26,950
Is this your trick?

364
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,640
"I've told you my rank,
so you have to tell me yours"?

365
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:33,648
See, my grades have fluctuated a lot.

366
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:37,304
Huh? Sajo, wasn't your last rank higher?

367
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,304
I'm not sure, I've forgotten.

368
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,488
I thought you definitely ranked
among the top 50,

369
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:44,096
so I asked you.

370
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,216
Unexpected.

371
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,224
So, is your ranking 76th good or bad?

372
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:50,640
It's 74th!

373
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,032
Got it, got it.

374
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,592
Why are you so proud?

375
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:57,272
Do you recall what rank
I received the last time?

376
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:58,408
I don't remember.

377
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,664
220th! I've improved a lot, haven't I?

378
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,664
So you were a fool.

379
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,176
Past tense! Seeing that you use
the past tense, I'll forgive you.

380
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,304
Hi, Sajo, what was your ranking?
I ranked 230th.

381
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:13,090
I wish I could be a fool like you.

382
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,248
Ah, um.

383
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,552
FIRST PLACE, SHINONOME CLAUDINE MARIKA
Our idol and goddess.

384
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,472
Natsukawa Aika.

385
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,968
She still maintains
her excellent grades, as always!

386
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:24,984
What is he doing alone?

387
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:31,896
I remember when I ranked 32th,
Natsukawa ranked 27th.

388
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:35,792
Did I indeed disturb
her exam revision before?

389
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:39,560
Is the top student
an international student?

390
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,480
Aika. Share half with me.

391
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:43,920
Share what with you?

392
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,968
Hmm… what should I share?

393
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,872
If it were the old me,
I would certainly have joined them.

394
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:52,960
However, it's not bad to watch Natsukawa
from a distance like this.

395
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,272
Natsukawa, you've grown.
As your fan, I'm incredibly honored.

396
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:58,464
Sajo.

397
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,888
What's wrong, Sasaki?
Finally stolen by your sister?

398
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,168
What was stolen?

399
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:08,720
Stolen your heart.

400
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,624
No, I meant to talk
about the exam ranking.

401
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:14,032
You aren't here to talk about your sister?

402
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,520
Look.

403
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:17,881
29TH PLACE, SASAKI TAKAAKI

404
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,352
You're doing well.

405
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:20,552
Right?

406
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:24,320
Are you the one who can't
keep up now? Hmm?

407
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:26,720
You dare to provoke me.

408
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,784
Your mockery of others is as lovely as
a painting. You are extremely irritating.

409
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:33,408
Now the situation is serious.

410
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,968
For an unattractive student like me,

411
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,470
my only weapon is academic subjects.

412
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,784
In other words, studying.

413
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:41,720
Now, a handsome soccer club member is
taking away even this advantage of mine.

414
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,576
I can hardly accept it.

415
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:45,528
My enthusiasm has been
completely stimulated,

416
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:48,736
and it exceeds my expectations!

417
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:50,328
I hope in the future,

418
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:52,088
all your passes are offside!

419
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:55,496
You really say some harsh things.

420
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,192
-I understand.
-Hmm.

421
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,216
Oh, you dyed your hair.

422
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:04,368
Hey, Sajo, are you okay?

423
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,340
I just feel like you're so cute
that I'm about to suffocate.
