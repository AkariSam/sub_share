1
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,980
Ouch.

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,120
Na-Natsukawa?

3
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,170
Wataru.

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,170
It hurts.

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,030
Where are you rushing off to
in such a hurry?

6
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,350
It hurts.

7
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,020
(You Smell Like Sweat…
It Looks Like You've Been Doing a Lot of Work)

8
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,390
What are you doing?

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Because I did a lot of manual labor today.

10
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,130
-I saw it.
-You saw it?

11
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,130
She's actually watching me?

12
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,760
Did she know I was there?

13
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,060
No, when did she find out?

14
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,990
Why didn't she greet me directly…

15
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,990
Right, she wouldn't
take the initiative to greet me.

16
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,650
You smell like sweat.

17
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,020
It looks like you've been
doing a lot of work.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
W-What's going on? What's happening?

19
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,440
This is the first time
she's been this close to me!

20
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,600
Is she losing her sense of distance
because she hasn't seen me in so long?

21
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,310
-Na-Natsukawa.
-What's up?

22
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,830
Um…

23
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,340
Something good happen to you?

24
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,770
No, how should I put it?

25
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,150
I feel like you're being
very gentle today.

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,120
Because you're closer to me than usual.

27
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,010
Yes.

28
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,280
She wouldn't intentionally
get close to me.

29
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,960
I-I'm sorry.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,090
-It's so hot.
-S-She's really cute.

31
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,490
If I'm not careful,
I'll find myself constantly praising her.

32
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,650
So, what is it? Do you need something?

33
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,600
You seem to be in a hurry
to get somewhere.

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,320
Well, that's because… I…

35
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,870
I saw you…

36
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,360
I saw you, so I ran over.

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,640
Me?

38
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,740
Why would you run over when you saw me?

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,540
Why?

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,170
I'd like to ask you, too,
why you didn't come to find me.

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,210
Why?

42
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,430
Because I thought
it would be better not to bother you.

43
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,850
It's been so long
since we've seen each other.

44
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,050
D-Don't you miss me?

45
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,800
You're too cute.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,190
What? Really!

47
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,580
That's what's annoying about you.

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,460
And that's exactly why people like you.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,060
It's my fault.

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Because I really didn't have time.

51
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,820
I know.

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,660
You said it in the text message.

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,920
Indeed.

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,970
You said a lot happened
at your part-time job.

55
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,400
Like the matter of Ichinose?

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,040
Yes, everything went smoothly after that.

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,020
Your advice encouraged me to pay closer
attention to other people's problems.

58
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,690
Thank you.

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,800
So you guys are getting along, huh?

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,940
Yes, I guess so.

61
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,210
Although I can't say
we're getting along very well,

62
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,990
I do believe we're getting closer.

63
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,240
I see, that's good.

64
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,300
Yes, I'm really relieved.

65
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,380
Huh? That's it?

66
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,080
Is she not going to ask
what happened after that?

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Isn't she curious?

68
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,900
Right, this is someone else's
business after all.

69
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,620
Natsukawa is most likely polite,
so she isn't asking too much, right?

70
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,200
Anyway, she's probably
not that interested in me.

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,520
Speaking of which,
it's been a long time since we last met.

72
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,730
This should be the first time we've met
since the summer vacation, right?

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,300
Is it? Did you get a tan?

74
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,680
Because I went to the beach with Kei.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,660
Speaking of which, Ashida sent me a photo.

76
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,250
Y-Yes. That photo.

77
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,090
Kei said she recalled the message,
but you still received it, didn't you?

78
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't see what the problem is?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Hey. Don't evade the question.

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,770
Huh? What do you mean?

81
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,490
Give me your phone.

82
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,100
Na-Natsukawa, this is a bit…

83
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,570
Wataru, I…

84
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,750
Huh? It's Aika indeed.

85
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,760
And Sajo.

86
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,460
Kei.

87
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,800
Oh my goodness, you just scared me.

88
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,130
You jumped on me.

89
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,330
S-Sorry, I just instinctively…

90
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,760
It's okay. Rather, I'm happy.

91
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,360
Here you go, please drink this.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,740
Thank you, Sajo.

93
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,450
Thank you.

94
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,280
Do you have to attend
club activities every day?

95
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,040
It's not like I have to go every day.

96
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,270
But the volleyball club
has a lot of matches.

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,070
Like the upcoming summer tournament
and exchange match.

98
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,350
Because you'll be a full-fledged
player next year, Kei.

99
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,190
You seem very energetic.

100
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,330
Sajo, did you get tanned too?

101
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,330
Well, because I went to White Beach--

102
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,390
Because I go out to work every day.

103
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,000
Why are you panicking?

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,840
I definitely didn't do anything guilty.

105
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,120
That's exactly
what a guilty person would say.

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,230
Damn. Why must you be
so astute at this crucial juncture?

107
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,680
Do I have to say I played with
a college-looking middle schooler?

108
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
Absolutely not.

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,050
Why don't you sit down?

110
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,600
Come, sit here.

111
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,880
Sit there?

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
You're not happy?

113
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,980
Not really.

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,470
So why did you come to school today?

115
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,530
Right. I wanted to ask too.

116
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,880
I'm here because my sister asked me to.

117
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,230
She asked me to assist in decorating
the campus open day venue.

118
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,240
Why did your sister ask you to help?

119
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,440
It's a long story.

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,290
It means your sister relies on you.

121
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,570
No, she just treats me as a servant.

122
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,160
By the way, regarding the open day guide…

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,450
Ordinary people aren't
usually given jobs like this, right?

124
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,200
Huh? What do you mean?

125
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,600
Senior Shinomiya…

126
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,510
She had previously told me,
somewhat awkwardly,

127
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,110
that the school had specifically
selected high-spec people

128
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,400
to be guides in order
to attract more students.

129
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,160
What?

130
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,100
No wonder they chose Aika.

131
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,190
Aika is cute and smart.

132
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,890
High spec? I'm not a computer.

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
She didn't use that term.

134
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,360
But look at the outcome.

135
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Luckily, our class chose Sasaki and you,
the two top.

136
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
Sajo, is that what you really think?

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,330
Huh? What's the matter?

138
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,920
Don't you want to replace Sasaki?

139
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,540
Then you can be a guide with Aika.

140
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,120
What are you thinking?

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,890
People like me can't do it.

142
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm not even in any clubs.

143
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
But didn't you help Ichinose?

144
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,640
That came naturally,
or you could say I couldn't stand still.

145
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,920
Are you plotting something?

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,150
I'm not. What's with that look?

147
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,720
I did, however, take the initiative

148
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,790
to communicate with her for work purposes.

149
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,080
After all, pestering is your specialty.

150
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,360
Watch your words.

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,980
Don't cause trouble for others.

152
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,540
I won't.

153
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,920
I won't cause trouble for anyone anymore.

154
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,340
Will you come to school again?

155
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,450
I still need to move the chairs back,
and I have other tasks to complete.

156
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,720
What about you, Kei?

157
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm supposed to be in the club.

158
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,630
I see.

159
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,220
Listen.

160
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,010
Let's gather again.

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,080
Let's gather again
after the campus open day.

162
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,450
No?

163
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,860
I'm totally okay with it.

164
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,230
But I'm not sure
when I'll finish the work.

165
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,200
Although the open day schedule is set,

166
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,570
I have no idea how long
the cleaning will take.

167
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,930
It's okay.

168
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,760
Then I'll gossip about you
while I wait for you.

169
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,630
Give me the iced tea if you say that.

170
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,890
No way.

171
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
I'll let go if you apologize to me.

172
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,300
Stop it, you two.

173
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,570
Aika.

174
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,970
BINAN BOOKSTORE

175
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,660
Good job, Ichinose. See you tomorrow.

176
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,690
You're off tomorrow, Sajo.

177
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
Oh yeah, it's the campus
open day tomorrow.

178
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,270
Thank you, Ichinose.

179
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,890
I totally forgot about it.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,070
You're welcome.

181
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,160
Are you certain you'll be fine
on your own for the entire day tomorrow?

182
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,490
I'll be fine. Thank you, Sajo.

183
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,940
Thank you, I will leave it to you then.

184
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,750
I'll tell Senior Ichinose
that you're trustworthy.

185
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,960
I still have a lot to improve.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,010
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

187
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,020
The president of Koetsu High School's
student union has something to say.

188
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,920
Everyone, please gather in the gym.

189
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,190
The gym is this way.

190
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,270
Hello, everyone.

191
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,880
Welcome to Koetsu High School.

192
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,140
I'm the student union president,
Yuki Hayato.

193
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,170
I hope you can learn about

194
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,320
Koetsu High School

195
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,040
and its students today.

196
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,450
He deserves to be
the student union president.

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,450
He captured the hearts
of the female students in an instant.

198
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,780
That's the end of my speech,
thank you everyone.

199
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,490
He really is our school's prince.

200
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,880
But our school's princess
is smiling at the middle school students.

201
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,930
And I must be the servant.

202
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,380
Let me see.

203
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,450
You're Inoue, Sasaki, Nakata, and Yamamoto

204
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,150
from White Beach Middle School, right?

205
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,460
I'm Sasaki, your guide for today.

206
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,040
Nice to meet you.

207
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,790
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

208
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,240
My surname is Sasaki, which sounds similar
to Sasaki's but has different characters.

209
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,250
I'm Sasaki,
with the human character on the left.

210
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,570
I'm Sasaki,
with the bamboo character on the right.

211
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,640
There's another person
who will be guiding you with me.

212
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm Natsukawa, nice to meet you.

213
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,270
Nice to meet you.

214
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,960
Next, we will take you around the campus.

215
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,680
Let me ask
if you have any questions first.

216
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
Any questions?

217
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,500
I have one. Can I ask a question?

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,470
Go ahead.

219
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,910
What is the relationship
between the two of you?

220
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,890
-He's blushing.
-Yeah, he is.

221
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,470
Sasaki and I are just classmates.

222
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,360
I see.

223
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,200
Then let's go.

224
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,040
After this, we won't answer
any more personal questions.

225
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,410
Okay.

226
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,920
I-I'm sorry.

227
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,390
It's okay.

228
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,100
Our school has about 630 students.

229
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,140
With six classes per grade
and 35 students per class,

230
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,650
it's easy to remember the names
and faces of classmates.

231
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,420
Although our school has
a high college admission rate,

232
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,920
some people choose to work or attend
vocational schools after graduation.

233
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,850
There are also a lot of club activities.

234
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,940
So it's the so-called
all-round development?

235
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,950
Sasaki, you're very good at explaining.

236
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,140
So are you.

237
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
Maybe it's because we're
all the eldest in the family.

238
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,330
Is that so?

239
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,420
How's Airi doing recently?
I wanted to see her.

240
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,600
Oh, about that…

241
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,930
Let's talk about it some other time.

242
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,050
Sorry, I was being presumptuous.

243
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,360
Can you all keep up?

244
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,570
Yes, we can.

245
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,990
Senior Natsukawa, why did
you choose Koetsu High School?

246
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,760
Because it has a high college admission
rate and the most beautiful uniforms.

247
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,300
I think so too.

248
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,890
The uniforms here are really pretty.

249
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,910
The school rules are also relatively lax.

250
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,020
Is White Beach really strict?

251
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,130
If your hair is messy from sleeping,
you'll get scolded.

252
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,670
So it's the so-called lady's education.

253
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,880
That's right.

254
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,640
But our school also has
a student council,

255
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,760
so it might not be much different
from yours in this respect.

256
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,960
You don't need to worry about that.

257
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,520
I really admire the student council
president, Senior Shinomiya.

258
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,980
That's right,
although our school is very free,

259
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,100
it doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want.

260
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,000
To gain equal freedom,
you must first accept responsibility.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,830
Does this imply that there are
a lot of honest people?

262
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,470
I can't be sure,
but what you said might be right.

263
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,660
-Next is…
-Really?

264
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,260
Are you already seeing someone?

265
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,370
You must have kissed already, haven't you?

266
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,610
Did you even go further? When?

267
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,790
That's none of your business.

268
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,060
Y-You guys should stop.

269
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,160
Why don't you tell us about it?

270
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,700
I really want to know.

271
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,340
This doesn't look good.

272
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,940
What are you guys doing?

273
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,040
This doesn't seem like
the regular tour route.

274
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,470
Natsukawa?

275
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,480
Aizawa, are you okay?

276
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,900
She's so cute.

277
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,950
I must attend Koetsu High School.

278
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,700
I don't mind if she is older than me.

279
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
Wh-What?

280
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,150
This school doesn't need people like you.

281
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,880
What do you mean by that?

282
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,030
I mean, we don't need you here.

283
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,670
Didn't you hear me?

284
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,060
We came here specifically
for a school tour.

285
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,600
No one invited you.

286
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,070
You are the ones who want to
challenge our entrance exam.

287
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,250
We are just guides.

288
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,700
We are not trying to please you.

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,090
-Right?
-Huh? Yes, that's right.

290
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,600
You can also visit our cultural festival.

291
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,850
Despite the fact that many schools
have recently downsized the event,

292
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,080
Koetsu will make it a grand event.

293
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,080
That sounds great.

294
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,780
I'm looking forward to it as well.

295
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,150
We'll have to come along then.

296
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,760
Definitely come.

297
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,160
Next time,
I want Mr. Sajo to be our guide.

298
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,890
You're talking about that guy, right?

299
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,880
Fuka is daydreaming again.

300
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,160
N-No, I'm not daydreaming.

301
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,430
Natsukawa, you can be quite harsh.

302
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,110
I guess I'm used to
dealing with difficult boys.

303
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,940
That's about it for the campus tour.

304
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,340
If you are interested in enrolling,
you can also visit the canteen and clubs.

305
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,680
Have you finished your tour?

306
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,940
We are really sorry.

307
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,500
We genuinely want to attend this school.

308
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,850
We hope you will welcome us
when the time comes.

309
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,170
I see. Good luck.

310
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,520
Yes.

311
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,870
Um… Thank you so much for today.

312
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,650
Don't mention it. We should thank you.

313
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,880
-Wataru.
-Mr. Sajo!

314
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,220
Mr. Sajo!

315
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,350
Miss Sasaki?

316
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,480
And Sasaki. Natsukawa?

317
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,840
What a combination.

318
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,440
I have a bad feeling about this.

319
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,690
I came for a school tour.

320
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,480
I didn't expect to see you.

321
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,510
I see.

322
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,670
We have seniors guiding us on the tour.

323
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,330
I see, I see.

324
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,740
What a coincidence.

325
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,110
Fuka.

326
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,960
Is this the Mr. Sajo you mentioned?

327
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,650
Which Mr. Sajo?

328
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,150
Stop teasing me here.

329
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,620
Are you the Mr. Sajo

330
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,380
who taught Fuka how to speak politely?

331
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,360
Are you the Mr. Sajo who made Fuka

332
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,210
realize the futility
of her romance manga obsession?

333
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,340
Are you the Mr. Sajo who taught

334
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,710
super naive Fuka some common sense?

335
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,900
W-Which Mr. Sajo?

336
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,030
No, no. I'm not obsessed.

337
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,080
And I'm not super naive.

338
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,250
Strange. Is Miss Sasaki always like this?

339
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,660
With me and Ichinose, she's different.
It appears she has become more naive.

340
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,140
Senior Sajo.

341
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,830
Please take care of Fuka.

342
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,440
Even though she's a bit strange,
she's a good kid.

343
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,180
It's too late for you guys to say this.

344
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,520
My bond with Mr. Sajo is already strong.

345
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,640
He's gentle, knowledgeable, and polite.

346
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,980
Like the time we went out together, he…

347
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,670
Hold on, Miss Sasaki.

348
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,280
I-I-I didn't mean that.

349
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,320
Well, we should leave now.

350
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,790
Fuka?

351
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,220
We've really troubled you today.

352
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,520
-Let's call it a day, guys.
-What's going on?

353
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Wait for me!

354
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,360
They are, after all,
a group of middle school students.

355
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,610
Yes.

356
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,380
Sajo, hang in there.

357
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,360
Sasaki!

358
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,680
Um…

359
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,460
Hello, Natsukawa.

360
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
What are you doing?

361
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,150
No, it's nothing.

362
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,990
Come over here.

363
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,550
They're talking about Sajo?

364
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,800
Gentle and knowledgeable, what else?

365
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,820
Polite.

366
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,330
Polite, huh? What else?

367
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,200
-Going out together.
-Yes, yes. Going out together.

368
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,160
You say you're busy all the time,

369
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,130
but you seem to
have a lot of fun and enjoy it.

370
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,370
I'm not enjoy it.

371
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,480
I do have a lot of fun…

372
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,400
What do you mean by that?

373
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,780
Don't ask such a tactless question.

374
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,440
My swimsuit photo.

375
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,080
I confess.

376
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,700
So that's how it is.

377
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,690
Alright, give me your phone.

378
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,610
Why? I've confessed everything.

379
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,690
That's a different matter.

380
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,470
I'll be shy.

381
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,010
I won't bury it in a folder.

382
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,950
I will admire it regularly.

383
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,370
That's why I'm not happy about it.

384
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,680
Sajo, you are very honest
in such situations.

385
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,260
See, even Ashida says so.

386
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,070
Idiot.

387
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,760
Then you should come and play with us.

388
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,680
If you don't want to, it's okay.

389
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,350
Wait, wait! I didn't hear just now.

390
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,880
I really didn't hear it,
please say it again.

391
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,510
You should come and play with us.

392
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,150
Me? Play with you?

393
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,440
Y-Yes.

394
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,460
Since you have time to play with others,

395
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,360
you can play with us too.

396
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,680
You don't want to?

397
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,700
Of course not! I'm very grateful.

398
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
Why have you become a samurai?

399
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,680
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PLAY?

400
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,850
SINCE I'M BRINGING ALONG AIRI,
THE PLACES WE CAN CHOOSE ARE LIMITED

401
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,680
OH, NATSUKAWA'S LITTLE SISTER?

402
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,770
WHY NOT GO TO THE BEACH AGAIN?

403
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,020
NICE

404
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING
TO THE BEACH WITH THIS LINEUP

405
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,030
HEHE, AFTER ALL,
WE HAVE TO WEAR SWIMSUITS

406
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,280
THAT'S A LETDOWN

407
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
WHY NOT COME TO MY HOUSE?

408
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,780
THAT SOUNDS GOOD

409
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780
IT WON'T BE A BURDEN ON AIRI EITHER

410
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,280
YAY!

411
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,290
SAJO, ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?

412
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
I'M STILL ALIVE

413
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,540
I DIDN'T FORCE YOU TO COME

414
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,830
I WANT TO GGO!

415
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,090
I WANT TO GOO!

416
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,050
I WANT TO GO!

417
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,050
CALM DOWN

418
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,050
YES!

419
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,050
DON'T SAY ANYTHING WEIRD TO AIRI

420
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,300
OF COURSE!

421
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,050
DON'T MAKE JOKES
THAT CHILDREN WON'T UNDERSTAND

422
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,310
MAKE SURE TO DRESS NEATLY BEFORE COMING

423
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,020
REMEMBER TO GREET
I DON'T LIKE RUDE PEOPLE

424
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,770
AIKA, ENOUGH

425
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,020
IF IT'S JUST US, IT'S FINE.
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT WITH AIRI.

426
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
AT YOUR SERVICE!

427
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,060
THANKS FOR INVITING

428
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,070
REALLY

429
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,320
Aika, you…

430
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,970
What's up?

431
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,770
Although I understand your feelings,

432
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,680
I believe you should be gentler with Sajo.

433
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,230
Otherwise, the distance between
you two will only get further.

434
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,850
I wish you both happiness.

435
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,460
What's wrong with you, sister?
