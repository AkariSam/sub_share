2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,720
Speaking of which,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,490
what will you do when I stop working
at the start of the school year?

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,300
I'll hire someone new,
I'm actually recruiting already.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,000
So, the notice at the door
is a job advertisement.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,880
Yes, you will be the senior
once the junior arrives.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,300
Um, yeah.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,790
What's up? You seem listless!

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,230
I'll leave the rest to you.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,470
Is "Kawashima Reiji" placed here?

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,720
Ex-Excuse me.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,180
Coming.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,790
Why does this person seem familiar?

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,240
Are you Ichinose?

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,180
Do you need anything?

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,280
I saw the job advertisement
at the entrance.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,530
Oh.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,540
Huh? You're here for the job?

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,190
Is that okay?

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,060
(Isn't that too sinful?)
The person you're talking about is Mina.

22
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,880
Do you know each other?

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,390
She's a regular customer of this shop.

24
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,600
I didn't expect her to apply for the job.

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm such a lucky guy.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,040
This old man becomes young again
when he's excited.

27
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,560
Mina, you're hired.

28
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,900
Wait a minute. Isn't this too fast?

29
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,600
Because I know what kind of person she is.

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,860
Ex-Excuse me.

31
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,500
My wife would definitely be happy.
Follow me, Mina.

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,450
Never mind, this way
I can resign without any worries.

33
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,450
You're Mina, right?

34
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,240
But your fringe is a bit…

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,110
Can you do something about it?

36
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,510
The boss lady is quite straightforward.

37
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,780
But I feel the same way.

38
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,810
I'm very happy that you came.

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,810
That's right.
How about I give you a haircut?

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,030
Wait. Stop, boss lady!

41
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,500
It's you, I was just
introducing the job content.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

43
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,600
Even though I like to worry
about others, this is too fast.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,640
Speaking of which, what should I do now?

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,460
If Ichinose and I only have
work interactions, here should be…

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,610
Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Sajo.

47
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,240
The boss told me
that you like to read, right?

48
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,650
Y-Yes.

49
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,300
When you read,
does your fringe get in the way?

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,720
How do you usually solve it?

51
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,120
I-I usually…

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,930
L-Like this.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,760
This is the first time
I've seen her face clearly.

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,150
Not bad. Then clip it up
when you're working.

55
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,260
Y-Yes.

56
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,690
I look forward to working with you.

57
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:23,480
BINAN BOOKSTORE

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,700
Good morning…

59
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,770
Talking to a bookstore junior
doesn't require such formality, right?

60
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,480
And we're in the same grade.

61
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,720
Morning, Ichinose.

62
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,970
Good morning.

63
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,210
It's so soft.

64
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh, um…

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,690
You are Ichinose, who sits next to me,

66
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,940
right? Although we haven't talked much,
it's nice to meet you.

67
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,740
She responds so slowly.
Can she really do the job?

68
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,300
Sajo, you're here.

69
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,960
Good morning, boss. You're full of energy.

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
From today on, I'll leave
Mina to you. Be a good senior.

71
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll try.

72
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,920
Teach her everything but the hard work.

73
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,640
Don't you dare have any weird ideas.

74
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,380
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,910
I'm just kidding.

76
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,910
Firstly, it's about your fringe.

77
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,920
That's right, remember to
pin them up when you're working.

78
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,180
Let's go then.

79
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,320
First, check yesterday's sales list
and organize the bookshelves.

80
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,890
It's easy.

81
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,140
When you respond to me, you can just nod.

82
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,900
But when you're responding to customers,
make sure to speak up.

83
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,830
O-Okay!

84
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,600
When you look at it this way,
there's quite a bit to do.

85
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,480
Um…

86
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,340
We need a small stool here.

87
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,890
Maybe I should do it.

88
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,640
I-I can handle this.

89
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,280
Are you hoping to fall
and then I'll catch you?

90
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm not hoping for that.

91
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,990
Next, we have to serve the customers.

92
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,520
The store is open now,
and customers might come in at any time.

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,410
No matter what, you should organize the
bookshelf first, just like I showed you.

94
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,020
Leave the books on the high shelves to me,
and I will handle the customer service.

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,530
As for the cashier's job,
you can just observe first.

96
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,010
I still have to give you that.

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,950
INTERN

98
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,700
Just put the rope through. That's it.

99
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,790
I should have let her do it herself.

100
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,290
It's quite distant.

101
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,360
Do you have any questions?

102
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,740
Um…

103
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,830
If there's nothing, it's fine.

104
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,800
Are there any?

105
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,840
No.

106
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,360
It's hard to get along, hey.

107
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,350
I think I covered everything,
the rest is getting used to it.

108
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,260
Although you'll definitely
discover it later.

109
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,620
But first, let me tell you that
many customers only look and don't buy.

110
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,300
You can start by checking out
the buttons on the cash register.

111
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,540
Okay.

112
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,890
So, you're buying.

113
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,380
There are no Mishima Yukio works here,
so the store is not worthy of the name.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,250
The masterpiece "Music,"
with its wonderful sexual descriptions,

115
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,000
transformed forbidden
bedroom affairs into beautiful art.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,130
The store claims to be a used bookstore,
but none of his works are available.

117
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,310
- What a disgrace!
- What is this old man talking about?

118
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,850
Hello.

119
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,530
You want to buy these two books, right?

120
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,940
Though I have no idea
what you're talking about,

121
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,370
I know you have brought
the goods to the cash register.

122
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,590
Do you need a book cover?

123
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,260
Yes, please.

124
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay.

125
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,360
The total for the two books is 220 yen.

126
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,552
JAPANESE LITERARY MASTER

127
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,100
Thank you for your patronage.

128
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,360
You can always handle that kind
of customer if you don't show your flaws.

129
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,800
Ichinose…?

130
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,590
Let's go to the warehouse first.

131
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,290
Excuse me, I want to find the boss lady.

132
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,610
What's the matter?

133
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,690
Because there was a weird customer,

134
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,820
Ichinose cried.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,280
What? She cried?

136
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,290
I let her rest in the warehouse,
so don't go looking for her, boss.

137
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,310
I think this situation is
better handled by a woman.

138
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,860
Okay, I got it.

139
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,110
Thanks.

140
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,880
After I resign,
can Ichinose manage on her own?

141
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,590
And forget about serving customers,

142
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,530
she even struggles to
communicate with her colleagues.

143
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,720
Maybe I should talk to the boss,
he might have some good ideas.

144
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,020
Uh… boss.

145
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,090
In terms of the work here,

146
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,690
customer service skills
are essential, right?

147
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,250
Yes, that's right.

148
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,800
If so, I don't think Ichinose
is suitable for this job.

149
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,360
What? How can you judge
a book by its cover?

150
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,730
So, boss, are you going
to clean up her mess?

151
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,660
And if you volunteer to take on tasks
that Ichinose is unable to handle,

152
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,720
the boss lady will be unable to sit still.

153
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,260
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,120
Ichinose has irritated me
in an unexpected way.

155
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,340
Is it because we don't get along,
or because I am too narrow-minded?

156
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,840
Mina is…

157
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,810
She is the cutest
regular customer at this shop.

158
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,340
Where has your usual spirit gone, Grampy?

159
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,160
I need to think of a solution.

160
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,750
At school, she's always alone.

161
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,520
But at least the shop owner cares about her
in this second-hand bookstore.

162
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,060
This should be her sanctuary, right?

163
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Well… I'll go talk to her.

164
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,360
R-Really?

165
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,670
Mm… But please don't expect too much.

166
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,750
Alright, I got it.

167
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,370
I can't let Ichinose hate this place.

168
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,420
Even if it's for the sake of
the shop owner.

169
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,120
So, only I, the person who is about
to quit, can say these words, right?

170
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,310
Sometimes women need to be tough too.

171
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,530
Thank you, boss lady.

172
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,840
You're welcome.

173
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,840
I was just teaching her to
prepare her mind for work.

174
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,030
Leave the rest to me.

175
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,690
Boss lady, were you
just sorting out the accounts?

176
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,380
Yes, that's right.

177
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,220
See you later then.

178
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,610
Ichinose, would you like to hear
what I have to say?

179
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,830
The customer just now was weird, right?

180
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,320
No one can serve customers
perfectly from the start.

181
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,190
It is normal for you
to be scared to tears.

182
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,990
When dealing with such customers,

183
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,490
speaking casually can be
extremely beneficial.

184
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,110
As long as they think you're
unable to communicate, they'll shut up.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
When you speak,

186
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,840
the other party may be scared
if you give off a tough girl vibe.

187
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,080
Serving customers is a tough job.

188
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
There is no such thing as 100% right,
but there is 100% wrong.

189
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,350
No matter how unreasonable
the other party appears to be,

190
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,280
we must deal with them properly
as long as they are customers.

191
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,460
So I want to ask you, can you do that?

192
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,880
Even if you are not good at talking,

193
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,930
you have to make people think
you are "competent" when you are at work.

194
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Can you do it?

195
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,740
If you can't,
that means this job isn't for you.

196
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,720
-Just endure with the pocket money your parents gave you.
-Idiot, calm down!

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,470
-There's no need to force yourself.
-As her senior,

198
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,464
-What are you here for?
-I shouldn't take away her right to choose,

199
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,096
but rather allow her to make her own!

200
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,490
Sorry. I just have
one last question for you.

201
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,660
Can you tell me whether
you want to serve customers well?

202
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,270
I still think she should
quit this job, to be honest.

203
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,400
If Ichinose visits as a customer,

204
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,880
the shop owner will greet her warmly.

205
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,700
Isn't that better for them?

206
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,440
I don't want to.

207
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,570
I don't want to. I don't want to give up!

208
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,140
Why?

209
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,060
I-I will try hard!

210
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,310
Please don't fire me!

211
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,710
Wait! Lift your head up! Seriously!

212
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,010
I-I'm just a part-time worker!

213
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,030
I don't have the authority to fire you!

214
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,030
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

215
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,910
I will try to become competent!

216
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,500
I got it! So lift your head up already!

217
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,790
What happened?

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,010
-Boss, Ichinose decided to stay.
-What?

219
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,010
So, start working hard tomorrow, okay?

220
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,490
Is that so?

221
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,740
It's about time,
you guys can clock out now.

222
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,390
No, there should still be work left.
I want to stay.

223
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,120
Alright, no need.
But remember to come tomorrow.

224
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,100
I got it.

225
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,230
Then…let's go back, Ichinose.

226
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,880
Y-Yes!

227
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm a terrible person.

228
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,830
Ichinose, what's wrong
with you? You seem so down.

229
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,240
Sorry for that.

230
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,420
I haven't been getting
along well with my sister recently.

231
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,560
MINA, NO REPLY

232
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,930
Don't worry, okay?

233
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,410
Yuri.

234
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,070
SAJO IS IGNORING US
-WORKING? -YEAH

235
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Oh no.

236
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,320
2 USERS ARE ON A VIDEO CALL

237
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,170
Why do they want to video call?

238
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,870
Here! You must want to go too.

239
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,330
The interior design is so fashionable.

240
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,510
Right? We are going
to take a lot of photos.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,250
If not, there will be so
many things to do after school starts.

242
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm okay with it. But have you done
your homework for the summer?

243
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,760
I have been taking my participation
in club activities very seriously.

244
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,840
I knew it. We will go to that shop as
a reward for finishing your homework.

245
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,970
I will teach you the parts
you don't understand.

246
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,090
Aika, I love you!

247
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,200
Don't say that.

248
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,980
I FELL ASLEEP AS SOON AS I GOT BACK FROM WORK
Girls need calories

249
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,300
from time to time, right?

250
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,870
Yes, it feels like this shop
should have low-fat options.

251
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,530
Are you listening?

252
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,830
But I'll definitely add the toppings.

253
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,570
Oh, Sajo really went to work.

254
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,700
I-I see.

255
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,800
I sent him a hurry-up message,
and it shows he read it.

256
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Huh? W-Wait.

257
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,710
Sajo. We haven't talked for a long time!

258
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,040
Yes. So Natsukawa
doesn't turn on the camera.

259
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,990
You look very tired, don't you?

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,100
I have a lot of troubles.

261
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,590
Really? Tell us.

262
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,310
Well… I have something to ask you.

263
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,500
Today at the place where I work,
I made a girl kneel down…

264
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,100
That's too much, isn't it?

265
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,010
Well, just pretend you didn't hear it.

266
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,380
-No way!
-I can't do it!

267
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,800
What did you do?

268
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,120
Well… she is an introverted person.

269
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,930
You could say it is a tragedy caused
by my disregard for her personality.

270
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,280
In short, it's all your fault?

271
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,640
How shall I put it?

272
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,080
Tell us.

273
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,530
Tell us.

274
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,250
This is how it is.

275
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,680
Anyway, this is my current worry.

276
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,890
To be precise,
I don't know how to face tomorrow.

277
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,270
Tomorrow,
will she still go to the bookstore?

278
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,500
I bet she won't.

279
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,750
Just kill me!

280
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,040
Sajo, you need to cheer up!

281
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,240
This is not entirely your fault.

282
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,700
After all, if she could
communicate normally,

283
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,770
this would not have happened, would it?

284
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,680
You are just a senior
who wants to cheer her on, right?

285
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,130
Well…it should be, I guess.

286
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,400
There is a reason why you did this.

287
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,460
I got it!

288
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,920
Sorry. My family called me to take a bath.

289
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,210
Goodbye!

290
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,780
That's too sudden!

291
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,440
Huh? Just now, were you cheering for me?

292
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,610
W-Why would you think so?

293
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,870
Because it doesn't
sound like an objective opinion.

294
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,910
It's your illusion!

295
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,320
S-Sorry.

296
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,960
By the way, how have you
been doing recently, Natsukawa?

297
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,740
Which aspect are you asking?

298
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,120
We have not seen each other
since summer vacation, have we?

299
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,320
Now that you bring it up, you are right.

300
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,500
But as long as you are
having fun with Ashida, it's good.

301
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,750
By the way, why don't
you turn on the camera?

302
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,710
Because I just finished bath.

303
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,080
Huh? Ah, sorry.

304
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,800
Speaking of, about the thing just now…

305
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,160
You have to listen
to your junior's troubles.

306
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,870
I got it, thanks.

307
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,590
Good morning.

308
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,920
Morning, Ichinose.

309
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,240
Y-Yes! Good morning!

310
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,110
Well… I am really sorry about yesterday.

311
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,460
Hmm, hmm.

312
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,630
There's still time before
the shop opens, let's tidy up slowly.

313
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,430
O-Okay!

314
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,260
Your reply is more
energetic than yesterday.

315
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Does she have a compelling reason?

316
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,790
It's time to open the shop.
I'll flip the sign.

317
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,200
Let me do it.

318
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,690
Well, I'll leave it to you.

319
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,360
I-I'm done.

320
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,090
You're doing great!

321
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,490
Such a big dust.

322
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,570
That was close.
Sometimes I treat her like a child.

323
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,640
Welcome.

324
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,870
I-I'll serve the customer.

325
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,650
A customer who checks out
without saying a word?

326
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,390
For Ichinose, it might be a bit difficult.

327
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,560
W-Welcome.

328
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,090
T-This book is 130 yen.

329
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,720
I-I received your 500 yen.

330
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,890
Uh… here is your change of 370 yen.

331
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,680
Um…

332
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,840
Hello!

333
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,330
Do you need a book cover
for a book this size?

334
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,110
Thank you for your patronage!

335
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,870
What's wrong with you, Ichinose?
You are different today.

336
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,310
Amazing! What did you do?

337
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,320
I watched some videos
about how to serve customers.

338
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,850
You're so sensible!
Keep serving customers in this state!

339
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,170
O-Okay.

340
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,120
Um… I'll go tidy up
the bookshelves inside.

341
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,110
Based on her performance today,
she clearly does not want to give up.

342
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,540
Even though it is not my place
to ask about her personal life,

343
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,790
I am really interested in
why she had to do it.

344
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,150
Sajo, Mina, it's about time
to take a break.

345
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,400
Okay.

346
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,240
The only chance to chat

347
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,500
with Ichinose would be now, right?

348
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,730
Ichinose, you're here today too.

349
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,800
What am I saying?
It sounds like I'm nitpicking.

350
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,610
Because I had a reason to do it.

351
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,500
So, why did you want to take this job?

352
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,000
Because I want to "be self-reliant".

353
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,520
Huh? What? That's too excellent.

354
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,080
I've never considered such a thing.

355
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,230
But isn't it too early? We are only
in our first year of high school, right?

356
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,800
I want to stop depending on my brother.

357
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,100
So, you have a brother.

358
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,100
He's a senior student council member.

359
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,050
A boy from the student council member?

360
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,520
Is it that senior who looks like a bear?

361
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,520
You are completely different from him,
including your appearance.

362
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,520
But why? A little sister's reliance
on her brother is not a problem.

363
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,840
Do you wish to depend but can't?

364
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,090
Speaking of which,
this is already about her family affairs.

365
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,410
We probably aren't close enough
to talk about things this deeply.

366
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,410
Let's just leave it at that for now.

367
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,950
I… love my brother the most.

368
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,820
When reading at home, I was always…

369
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,950
sitting on my brother's lap,

370
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,340
leaning against his stomach.

371
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,320
It's warm and comfortable.

372
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,580
What's that? It sounds super comfortable.

373
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,250
But one day,
my brother brought a woman home.

374
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,630
Since then, I have spent less time
talking with my brother.

375
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,460
-Even so, I still want to be with my brother.
-Huh? Can I listen to this?

376
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,020
-One day, I decided to express
-You shouldn't be telling me this!

377
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,520
-these feelings to my brother.
-Wait! I have a bad feeling!

378
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,690
I don't want to listen…
but I really want to.

379
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,960
I noticed a pair of shoes I did not
recognize when I got home from school.

380
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,870
I instantly realized
they were Senior Yuri's shoes.

381
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,910
But my mind was blank at that moment.

382
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,360
I dashed to my brother's room
and opened his door without knocking.

383
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,410
And then…

384
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,800
And then…?

385
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,680
An-And then…!

386
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,120
And then I saw…

387
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,660
Se-Senior Yuri being
pinned down by my brother.

388
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,970
They were kissing…!
