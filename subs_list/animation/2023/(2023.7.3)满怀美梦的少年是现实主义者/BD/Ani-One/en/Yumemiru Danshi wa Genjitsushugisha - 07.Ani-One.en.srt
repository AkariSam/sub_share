1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,820
Look, it's the sea.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,960
Such a vast sea.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,720
It's especially refreshing under nature,

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,670
and you can even smell the sea breeze.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,270
When the sea breeze is strong,
the humidity is high,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,920
making hair care difficult.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,460
Is that so?

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,160
Is it really okay for you
to come out today?

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,080
No problem,
because today is a "special outing".

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,600
Indeed, it is.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
You're using the handkerchief I gave you.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,790
Of course.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,110
After all, this is a gift from you.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,410
I'm glad you like it.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,000
I chose it based on how I perceived you.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,190
Oh, I see.

17
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,760
(The College Girl is Really Impressive)
What should I write for this year's book recommendation?

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
STAFF PICKS: THIS YEAR'S BOOK RECOMMENDATION
Hello, Mr. Sajo.

19
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,590
Welcome, Miss Sasaki.
Are you heading to campus today?

20
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,600
No, I'm planning to go to the library.

21
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,840
I had something to tell you,
so I came here.

22
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,110
Really?

23
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,090
Your regular visits help to
heal both my body and mind.

24
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,800
That's a stylish bracelet.
So you will also wear such accessories.

25
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,970
I just got influenced by a friend.

26
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,810
I even made a bracelet with
my father not long ago.

27
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,280
Made it yourself?

28
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,240
Speaking of which, this college girl
gets along well with her father.

29
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,380
Big Sis has requested separate laundry
from our father since elementary school.

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,770
Mr. Sajo?

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,270
It's nothing.
I just think you're so crafty.

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,370
This was made in a seaside store,
where the owner taught me as I made it.

33
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,240
That's really nice.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,040
What's the name of the store?

35
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,480
Let me see.

36
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,480
This is the one.

37
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,760
It's a shop run by
a beautiful older sister.

38
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,520
I think you would definitely like it.

39
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,070
Do I look like
I like older sisters that much?

40
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,630
You would probably like
this kind of personally run shop, right?

41
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,940
Yes, I quite like it.

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,720
Do I need to take a train
and a bus from here?

43
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,680
Are you going?

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,790
Yes, because the crafts are beautiful.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,200
And…

46
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,490
And?

47
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,360
I can design my own accessories.

48
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,470
Natsukawa's birthday is coming up,
what should I give her this year?

49
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,040
I have even considered
whether or not to give her…

50
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,570
Oh, they can even make such an accessory.

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,330
What's wrong, Miss Sasaki?

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,750
Would you like to go together?

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,780
And so, I never thought

54
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,480
I would go on a special outing
with a college girl.

55
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,200
Is this the effortless skill
of a college girl?

56
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,336
She doesn't seem to have
any special feelings

57
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:35,096
about going out with me alone.

58
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,920
Miss Sasaki?

59
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,880
Well, I was thinking about being seen
by others and…

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,260
Is it because you're shy about
being misunderstood as my girlfriend?

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,660
It's because of this dress.

62
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
Huh? The dress?

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,550
You still give off a mature
big sister vibe, as per usual.

64
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,580
No, it's not like that.

65
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,200
Actually, I only wear this dress

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,080
when I see you or other people
outside of campus.

67
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,120
Huh? Then what do you usually wear?

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,400
I usually wear the clothes
I wore in elementary school.

69
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,480
Can you still fit into
your elementary school clothes?

70
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,630
Won't your friends say anything about it?

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
For example, you should
wear other clothes.

72
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
How did you know?

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,720
People often say that to me.

74
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,650
Those clothes are cute
and I quite like them.

75
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,890
Um… how should I put it?

76
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,640
It's fine to wear them at home.

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,810
I see.

78
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,184
But I think it is fantastic that

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,784
you can keep clothes for so long.

80
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,240
Thank you for your compliment.

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,520
AIKA, I'M HERE
-I MIGHT BE A WHILE -OKAY

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,610
Kei.

83
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,960
Sorry, I came late because I was
helping Airi change clothes.

84
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,590
It's okay.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,720
Airi!

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,360
Kei, what did you pack in there?

87
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,640
We need to pack a lot for
the beach, right? What'd you pack?

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
More than half of the items are Airi's.

89
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,880
This is the Sajo house, isn't it?

90
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,950
Sajo really lucked out.

91
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,670
He gets to see you in a swimsuit.

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,630
Should we call him?

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,840
Let's give him the heavy duty
of carrying the luggage.

94
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,620
But, all of a sudden,
I am not sure he would agree.

95
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,310
Huh? He went out to work?

96
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,030
I thought he must be idle.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,590
Going to the beach with Kei!

98
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,600
Going to the beach! Airi, come here!

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,810
Because of the beautiful white coastline,
everyone says it is called White Beach.

100
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,020
Yeah.

101
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,290
Do college girls usually
go for drives on dates?

102
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,900
Are you looking for a beautiful big sister
in a swimsuit? You can't do that.

103
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,860
I-I would never do something like that.

104
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm just marveling
at how beautiful the sea is.

105
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,400
Mr. Sajo, you said you haven't been
to the beach for a while, right?

106
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,960
It's been a few years since I've been.

107
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,870
Do you often come to
the beach, Miss Sasaki?

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,190
Yes, I came with my family last year.
Though I haven't gone swimming this year.

109
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,310
I came here with my friends
when I was in middle school.

110
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,380
I'm about the same.

111
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,470
It's troublesome to buy a new swimsuit
every year, isn't it?

112
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,480
Huh? Don't you wear last year's?

113
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,560
It doesn't fit anymore.

114
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,960
Mr. Sajo?

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,900
Let's see. Where do we go from here?

116
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,370
Over there. I remember the way,
let me lead.

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,200
Really?

118
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,470
Then I'll leave it to you.

119
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,880
T-This is impure interaction
between the sexes!

120
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
M-Miss Sasaki.

121
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,550
I'm sorry! I accidentally and habitually…
I'm really sorry.

122
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,660
It's okay, no need to apologize.

123
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,540
Anyway, let's go.

124
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,260
Okay.

125
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,300
Are your feet alright?

126
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,880
They're fine because
the soles of the shoes are thick.

127
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,440
Let's walk slowly then.

128
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,160
Thank you.

129
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,640
Okay.

130
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,170
The college girl is really impressive.

131
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,730
Is it here? I suddenly feel a bit nervous.

132
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,440
No need to be nervous.

133
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,640
I've been here before. Let's go in.

134
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,420
Oh, okay.

135
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,310
I'm the only guy?

136
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,440
Now I'm getting even more nervous.

137
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,810
Welcome.

138
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,800
Oh? You are…

139
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,480
Hello, I've been here before.

140
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,650
I knew it. There was a mature girl
left a lasting impression on me.

141
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,510
Is it?

142
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,490
Are you here with your boyfriend today?

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
Uh, well, he is…

144
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,960
We're not in that kind of relationship.

145
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,470
Oh, is that so?

146
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,168
-What's this?
-Take your time to look.

147
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,570
-White-collar beauty and college girl love topic?
-Okay.

148
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,000
I suddenly feel like a child
who hasn't grown up.

149
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,250
It's so beautiful.
Do you want to take a look around?

150
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,680
Sure.

151
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,920
These must be the materials, right?

152
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,540
This is…

153
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,580
There's only half left.

154
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,150
That's part of the pearl shell.

155
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,420
Is this the broken part?

156
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,140
No, it's intentionally cut into
small pieces for easier processing.

157
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,230
Because the shell is hard.

158
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,920
Is this used for grinding?

159
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,010
Yes, but it's hard to
grind with sandpaper,

160
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,370
so you need to use a diamond file.

161
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,720
How should I put it?

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,180
I thought it would be similar to
the seal carving taught in class.

163
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,800
Can I really do this well?

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,670
Mr. Sajo?

165
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,550
I'm fine. This is…

166
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,180
These are beautiful.

167
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,200
These are abalone shells
transported from New Zealand.

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,800
Do you like this kind?

169
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,210
Rather than saying I like it…

170
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,960
Mr. Sajo, would you like to
make something?

171
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,880
Body touch alert!

172
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,700
It's a rare opportunity.

173
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,770
If I just buy something and go home,
I feel a bit remorseful.

174
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,630
Great.

175
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,840
What would you like to make, Miss Sasaki?

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,590
Last time, I made a bracelet by
stringing small shells together,

177
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,050
so this time I want to make a necklace.

178
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,420
That's a good idea.

179
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,090
What about you, Mr. Sajo?

180
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,240
Let me think.

181
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,800
Right now, I only have a vague idea.

182
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,390
In that case, it is best to first consider
what you want to make.

183
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,680
If you accidentally wear out the shell,
it would be a problem.

184
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,350
I see.

185
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,000
That makes sense.

186
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,880
After all, this is a gift for Natsukawa.

187
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,540
I want to make something that
matches her as much as possible.

188
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm sorry if I got the wrong idea,
but are you giving this as a gift?

189
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,560
Since you are thinking seriously,
I assumed you would give it away.

190
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,390
Is that so?

191
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,280
Sort of. The birthday of someone
I know is coming up.

192
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,200
-Is she a female?
-Is she a girl?

193
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,810
Yes, I do want to make jewelry
or other pretty things.

194
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,160
Typical of a boy.

195
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,920
That's a very boyish thought.

196
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,530
If you want to make it yourself,
you should start with these materials.

197
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,520
Do you have anything you like?

198
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,640
I'll choose this! It's so cute.

199
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,550
A baby shell, huh.

200
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,520
Pink? It seems to match
Natsukawa quite well.

201
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,330
No, pink won't work,
I'll be overwhelmed by its cuteness.

202
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,400
And it's a bit inconsistent with
the impression that Natsukawa gives.

203
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,470
What's something that can further
highlight Natsukawa's strengths?

204
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,260
Could it be the person you like?

205
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,520
That person who's about to
celebrate her birthday.

206
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,460
I really can't hide anything from you.

207
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,760
Your girlfriend will be delighted to

208
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,610
receive handcrafted jewelry
for her birthday.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
No, she's not my girlfriend.

210
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,480
I have no intention to date her.

211
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,590
Even though I do like her,
but it's just my unrequited love.

212
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,780
I see.

213
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,190
But if you don't want
to date her, why still…?

214
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,790
My love story hasn't ended.

215
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,560
Because I can't let go of
my feelings for her…

216
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,410
Don't follow me.

217
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,150
I fallen for Natsukawa
and got rejected by her.

218
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,500
Maybe I can't get any further with her.

219
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,440
Even so,

220
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,840
these two and a half years
have not been without gains.

221
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,560
My studies have improved.

222
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,720
If I hadn't fallen for Natsukawa,

223
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,570
I probably wouldn't have
"pushed myself" like this.

224
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,580
So it's my self-satisfaction.

225
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,420
Her birthday is an excuse for me
to give her a gift.

226
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,968
If I can make her smile,

227
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,664
it would be my greatest fortune.

228
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,800
There's no one in the world
who wouldn't be happy to receive a gift.

229
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,450
Really?

230
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,780
Yes, that's what I believe.

231
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,490
Sorry to interrupt,
have you made your decision yet?

232
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,600
Sorry, not yet.

233
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,270
No, I just need to give Natsukawa
the gift that I think suits her.

234
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,600
Even if she doesn't like it,
it doesn't matter.

235
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,520
What's important is that
I can give Natsukawa the gift.

236
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,290
Do you have anything lighter colors
than the one just now?

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

238
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,480
Airi, catch the ball!

239
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,620
I caught it!

240
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,220
Great! Next, let's see who can
get to the sea faster!

241
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,120
You did great, Airi.

242
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,950
Very good, very good.

243
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,810
Whew, I'm exhausted.

244
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,410
Sorry, but you rarely get a break
from your club activities.

245
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,920
No problem, I like to be active.

246
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,380
Aika, you should take a break. You've been
taking care of everything non-stop.

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,280
What a fashionable store.

248
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,450
Does it say "handicraft shop" on the sign?

249
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,490
Should we make something as a memento?

250
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm going to do it!

251
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,130
Let's go take a look.

252
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,210
I want to make jewelry
with this impression.

253
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,980
Miss Sasaki, do you have a younger sister?

254
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,490
That was taken when I came here
with my father before.

255
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,220
Miss Sasaki, could it be that
you're interested in cosplay?

256
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,940
Mr. Sajo, you're quite the joker.
That's my junior high school uniform.

257
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,680
What?

258
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,830
Sorry, we don't have
any ready-made ones here.

259
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,670
It's okay, my request was too capricious.

260
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,430
What on earth is going on?

261
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,980
This is the closest color
to what you want.

262
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,750
I'm going to work on this next, right?

263
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,890
What a beautiful color.

264
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,240
Right now, I'm cutting
a hard abalone shell.

265
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,200
No, that's not the point.

266
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,010
Keep going.

267
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,860
How could this be
a junior high school girl!

268
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,530
-Look this up.
-Mr. Sajo, you're fired up!

269
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,450
I can't help but be fired up.

270
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,928
Because I don't know

271
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:57,740
who to talk to about my doubts!

272
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,120
I am Sasaki Fukka, from the third grade
at White Beach Junior High School.

273
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,160
Huh? Could this be
my first formal introduction?

274
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,300
Uh. Indeed, you surprised me.

275
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,570
I thought you'd be older.

276
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,640
No way, haven't I already told you?

277
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,320
I was just a child not long ago.

278
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,990
But, compared to you,

279
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,160
I might still be a child.

280
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,340
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

281
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,130
Middle school girls are
quite something these days.

282
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,630
I am sorry for keeping
you waiting, Miss Sasaki.

283
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,490
I didn't expect it to be this tough.

284
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,340
It's okay, I'm also having fun.

285
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,840
An angel.

286
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,880
Um, Mr. Sajo?

287
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,190
Yes!

288
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,490
About the topic just now, you really…

289
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,510
What's wrong?

290
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,420
You've already given up on that girl,
haven't you, Mr. Sajo?

291
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,920
Um, yes.

292
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,130
You've already given up on her,
why can you still work so hard for her?

293
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,700
It is indeed puzzling.

294
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,400
The magic is that I can muster
the energy if I think it is for her.

295
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,200
No, it's nothing. If you were in love,
you'd understand, right?

296
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,550
To be in love?

297
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,710
Excuse me, but what's in love?

298
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,600
Personally, I doubt it will be
a pleasant experience.

299
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,510
Is that so?

300
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,180
Uh-huh, I'm the one more interested
in what love is.

301
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,640
I have been looking for this answer for
two and a half years and haven't found it.

302
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,800
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

303
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,168
After hearing my words,

304
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,504
do you feel like it's better
not to be in love?

305
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,630
No, not at all.

306
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,230
Even though it was unrequited love,
it wasn't just bitter memories.

307
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,528
If it weren't for this love,

308
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:04,490
I would probably be more childish now.

309
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,720
I see.

310
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,640
Hello there.

311
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,740
-Huh?
-My apologies.

312
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,740
Today's craft class has ended.

313
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,680
Oh, really? That's a shame.

314
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,360
Did you hear that, Airi?

315
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,770
We'll come again next time.

316
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,330
Thank you for that,
feel free to look around.

317
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,710
Wow, how cute! So it can actually
make something like this?

318
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,940
So beautiful.

319
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,730
C-Can we start eating yet?

320
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,750
Wait a bit longer, okay?

321
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,390
It can't be him, can it?

322
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
Aika, here you go.

323
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,460
Thank you.

324
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,710
Airi wants some too!

325
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,520
What I'm giving to Airi is

326
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,440
a special kid's meal!

327
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,990
Great, that's fantastic.
Kei, what about you?

328
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,290
A super-special deluxe tropical meal.

329
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Just kidding. Let's eat together.

330
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,280
It's so cold.

331
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,920
There's also pineapple.
Airi, do you want some?

332
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,140
I want some!

333
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,160
Aika, what's wrong?

334
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,530
Nothing. I think I just saw
someone who looks like him.

335
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,900
We went out of our way to invite Sajo,

336
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,040
but he was not home today.
He is passing up an opportunity.

337
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,980
Did he really go to work?

338
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,300
Or maybe he went on a date?

339
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,450
Anyone could, but not him!

340
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,770
After all, Sajo's got
his heart set on you.

341
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,240
That is…

342
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,590
Sister…

343
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,570
Oh dear.

344
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,140
Come to sister. It's okay, it's okay.

345
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,830
Mr. Sajo, your accessories haven't
been completed yet.

346
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,880
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,390
No need to apologize.

348
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,800
I can't keep you
wandering around until it's late.

349
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,000
If I didn't have a curfew…

350
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,590
No, no, no, your father would worry.

351
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,520
We must come again next time.

352
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,640
I'll make one for you then.

353
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,500
Really?

354
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,140
Yeah. And also…

355
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,530
I'll give you a safety alarm
to use on your way to school.

356
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,810
Will…

357
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,470
Will I be in a relationship
when I go to high school?

358
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,560
I imagined it
and started to get a little scared.

359
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,380
What are you laughing at!

360
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,760
Sorry, don't worry.

361
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,750
Because there is simply
no time to be afraid.

362
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,680
Is that so?

363
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,440
You can look forward to it.

364
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,590
Even if you're a senior,
you're too composed.

365
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,860
Just caring about the timing
is meaningless.

366
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,510
Love always comes unexpectedly.
You can never plan for it.

367
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,700
The next stop is Wakamatsu. Wakamatsu.

368
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,360
You must be tired. I'll wake you up
when we arrive.

369
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,670
Maybe…

370
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,520
N-Nothing.

371
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,770
She does have a middle schooler's side.

372
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,120
YOU HAVE BEEN INVITED TO A GROUP CHAT

373
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,690
What's up?

374
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,740
DARE TO REFUSE OUR INVITATION. YOU'RE REALLY HIGH UP, AREN'T YOU?
You're really high up, aren't you?

375
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,900
Huh? What is this?

376
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,610
Why is she wearing a swimsuit?
And this is White Beach, right?

377
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,620
Mr. Sajo…

378
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,920
No way.
