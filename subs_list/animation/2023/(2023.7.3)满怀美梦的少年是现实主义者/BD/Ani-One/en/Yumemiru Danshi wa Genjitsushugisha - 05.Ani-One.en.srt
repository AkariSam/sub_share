1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,090
Should we spend our summer break
having fun?

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,090
Sure, sure.

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,180
I want to have more fun with Airi.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,010
Huh? Sorry, what were you saying?

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,610
I said I wanted to
have more fun with Airi.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,200
Airi is so cute.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,976
But I have no idea
why Airi suddenly pounced on me.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,670
I'm sorry about that.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,380
No worries. She's cute.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,950
Aren't you going to invite Sajo as well?

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,830
Although he has not been pestering
to Natsukawa as much lately.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,200
Is he embarrassed?

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,560
Because Natsukawa is so popular now.

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,390
Is that so?

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,370
I wonder if he has a reason.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,130
He must have had a reason for giving up
after being so persistent.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,650
I don't know why either.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,570
It is indeed strange.

19
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:40,015
(Should we open it and take a look?
Should we? To see what's inside?)

20
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,460
So she is Natsukawa Aika.

21
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,420
Everyone remarks on
her striking appearance.

22
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,330
I believe she has some utility.

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
Are you looking for Natsukawa?

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,130
W-Who are you?

25
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,700
Please don't approach people from behind.

26
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,040
Do you know who I am?

27
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,608
Unlike you, I am noble--

28
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,360
So this is how the noble will scream.

29
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,432
Wh-What are you doing!

30
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,510
How could Marika do something like that?

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,930
Unreasonable! People on
the east side are hopeless!

32
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,330
Let's go! Don't bother with
this kind of person.

33
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,150
Agreed, goodbye!

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
Let's go quickly.

35
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,090
What's the fuss?

36
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,520
Sajo, what happened?

37
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,760
No, nothing.

38
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,260
Just three strange young ladies showed up.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,690
Three young ladies?

40
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,680
It takes all sorts to make the world.

41
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,620
Wh-Why are you here?

42
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,040
Good morning, Natsukawa.

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,940
Do you think it is a little chilly today?

44
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,600
Is it?

45
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,590
Is it my illusion?

46
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,040
W-Wait for me!

47
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,990
What's wrong with him? Geez.

48
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,230
What's--

49
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Natsukawa!

50
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,870
What?

51
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,110
Huh?

52
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,610
A tender and juicy man.

53
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
You seem to be dying.

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,590
Don't mock me.

55
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,310
What a bummer.

56
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,300
Here you go.

57
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,360
This handkerchief has not been used.

58
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,990
Take it and clean yourself.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,680
No need. I'm too embarrassed to use it.

60
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,350
J-Just take it.

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
You can use this too.

62
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,450
So stinky! It stinks!
It smells like sweat!

63
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,930
Isn't this the one you just used?
Spare me.

64
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,080
Is he asleep? Is he asleep? No way.

65
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,480
He fell asleep too quickly.

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,300
What's wrong?
There was a loud noise just now.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,610
I haven't fallen asleep yet.

68
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,010
From 1789 to 1795,

69
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,840
the French Revolution was
a bourgeois revolution.

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,640
Damn, I fell asleep.

71
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,280
World History.
Is it already the third lesson?

72
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,700
I should act as if I have been
awake for quite some time.

73
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,830
It seems I didn't sleep well.

74
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
My head hurts. It hurts!

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,090
Sajo, are you awake?

76
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,480
Sajo, you finally woke up.

77
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,920
The students informed me as to
why you were wearing a sports shirt.

78
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,820
I can understand you're a bit upset.

79
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,060
But you can't stop listening
to the lecture because of that.

80
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,720
Yes.

81
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,590
-Madam…
-What is it?

82
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,630
C-Can I go to the school infirmary?

83
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,360
Go ahead.

84
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,370
Find another student to show you
the notes later.

85
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,400
Yes.

86
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,810
Hey! Sajo?

87
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,890
Sajo, are you okay? Sajo?

88
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,890
You're quite an interesting guy.

89
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,460
I started pretending
when I was in junior high.

90
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,920
I learned to keep my true feelings hidden.

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,640
I learned to look at things sarcastically.

92
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,850
I thought this was what they
meant by maturing.

93
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,600
Over here, Sajo. Come quickly.

94
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,570
Alright, I'm coming.

95
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,060
Are you okay?

96
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:49,710
SCHOOL INFIRMARY

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh my, so he passed out like this.

98
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,270
Such a sinful performance.

99
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,920
How can it be a performance, Madam?

100
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,510
After all, he doesn't appear
to have been hit on the head.

101
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,500
Although he has a fever,
he should be fine.

102
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,890
He's still sleeping now.

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,540
Would you like to take a look?

104
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,010
Okay.

105
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,160
Okay.

106
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,350
I believe this is the first time
we have seen his sleeping face.

107
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,750
So you were worried about him?

108
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,460
I-I…

109
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,450
Alright, alright,
the next lesson is about to start.

110
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,800
You should get back to the classroom.

111
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,010
Sorry.

112
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,600
Don't worry.

113
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,470
Damn it.

114
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,150
Oh, you're awake?

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,460
You passed out in class.

116
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,650
Your classmates carried you here.

117
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,870
I see.

118
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,880
Did I catch a cold?

119
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,250
Yeah. I took your temperature earlier
and it was 38.6 degrees Celsius.

120
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,340
The temperature may still rise.

121
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,890
No way.

122
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,560
I was fine this morning.

123
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,150
Is it because your tense nerves
relaxed suddenly?

124
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,440
You must be exhausted.

125
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,980
Exhausted…

126
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,730
This includes mental exhaustion.

127
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,660
Take this.

128
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,970
Sleep a little longer.

129
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,510
Okay.

130
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,200
Why am I so worried about him?

131
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,720
Look, look. No way.

132
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,800
Look at that.

133
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,360
She's a goddess. I'm dying.

134
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,320
Shinomiya!

135
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,760
STUDENT COUNCIL
Wow, you look so cool.

136
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,700
Hello.

137
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,180
Excuse me, are you Ashida?

138
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,160
Y-Yes. L-Long time no see.

139
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,440
I have to talk to Sajo.

140
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,520
Oh, he…

141
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,950
Actually, he…

142
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,620
He passed out?

143
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,970
It seems you haven't told Kaede yet.

144
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,380
We plan to visit Sajo…

145
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,040
We plan to visit Sajo once more.

146
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,950
Do you want me to ask him how he is doing?

147
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,860
No need.

148
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,440
We will pay him a visit
after I notify Kaede.

149
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,990
O-Okay.

150
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,990
Thank you.

151
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,250
You've always admired her, haven't you?

152
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,980
Yeah, why are you pinching my face?

153
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,610
So light!

154
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,680
Sajo's bag is so light!

155
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,330
Don't shake it around like that.

156
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,260
Oops, it really is light.

157
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,470
Should we open it and take a look?
Should we? To see what's inside?

158
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,450
It is not right to just go through
someone else's belongings.

159
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,450
What if we find some adult magazines?
That wouldn't be good.

160
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
How can there be…

161
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,820
Is that possible?

162
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,960
Is there or not? I'm so excited.

163
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,920
I told you I won't look!

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,750
You're not looking? Really?

165
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,980
-No.
-This is a golden opportunity.

166

(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

167
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,090
SCHOOL INFIRMARY

168
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,200
We're coming in.

169
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,560
Huh?

170
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,650
Sajo, are you awake?

171
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,696
Shh!

172
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,460
Shh.

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,592
He is probably still sleeping.

174
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:02,560
I wonder if he's feeling better.

175
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:14,680
Wh-What? You should say something
if you are awake.

176
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:18,472
Can't you sleep?

177
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,192
No.

178
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,664
Do you need anything?

179
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:24,704
Here's some Pocari Sweat.

180
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:30,560
Sorry.

181
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,830
I have shocked everyone.

182
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,296
Not at all.

183
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:37,920
What's wrong? You're acting a bit weird.

184
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:39,650
What's that weird?

185
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:41,320
If you ask me, I…

186
00:12:58,624 --> 00:12:59,840
-Wataru!
-Sajo!

187
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:02,712
I'm sorry. I have a bit of a headache.

188
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:07,020
You don't have to try hard to talk.

189
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:08,088
Don't touch me!

190
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:11,024
Wh-Why?

191
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,424
I don't want to infect others.

192
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:16,984
I don't want to pass it to Airi.

193
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:20,544
Huh? Um.

194
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,664
I don't want to make others suffer.

195
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:26,568
SCHOOL INFIRMARY

196
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,208
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

197
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,872
What's going on? What's happening?

198
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:34,496
The feeble Sajo is…

199
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,144
We can't say things like this.
It's too unserious.

200
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,728
We didn't come to visit him for this.

201
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,576
What's wrong with you guys?

202
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,216
-Shinomiya!
-Sister!

203
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:47,936
STUDENT COUNCIL
S-Sorry.

204
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,020
We've been waiting for you both.

205
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,360
I-Is that so?

206
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,040
How is he?

207
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,536
Um…

208
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,744
Sis, it's you.

209
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,888
How are you feeling?

210
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,240
My head hurts a lot.

211
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,870
I heard you passed out?

212
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,912
I'm fine now.

213
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,208
You dummy.

214
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,240
Let me see.

215
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:19,576
So cool.

216
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,280
Is there anything you want?

217
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:23,752
I will buy it for you.

218
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,624
I'll go call Mom.

219
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,480
You probably haven't informed Mom yet.

220
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:30,960
I'll be back soon.

221
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:34,992
Wataru…

222
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,040
Good morning, everyone.

223
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:48,840
The morning meeting is about to start.

224
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:52,424
Sajo is absent today, right?

225
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:01,589
COLD MEDICINE

226
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,448
Na-Natsukawa? Ashida!

227
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,080
You finally picked up!

228
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,152
Were you sleeping just now?

229
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,592
You really dare to come.

230
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,096
"You really dare to come…"?

231
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:22,220
FEELS GOOD TO BE ALIVE

232
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,944
WHAT'S THE MEANING? WHAT'S WRONG? STILL ALIVE?
If you are kidding,

233
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,613
DEAD? HUH? REALLY?
act like it.

234
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:29,080
Why did you leave a confusing message
and then leave?

235
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:33,621
COLD MEDICINE

236
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:36,424
I had hundreds of unread messages.

237
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,424
DEAD? HUH? REALLY?
Sorry, I fell asleep. Send.

238
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:42,880
WHAT? SLEEP FOR A LIFETIME. DON'T WAKE UP.

239
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:45,928
You asked for it.

240
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,208
Aika was the one who decided
to pay you a visit.

241
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,712
W-Wait a minute, Kei!

242
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,304
Really?

243
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:57,344
B-Because you got all wet for me…

244
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,816
No, it's nothing.

245
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,072
Fortunately, Aika knows where you live.

246
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:11,672
I-It's because I asked Yamazaki before.

247
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,456
Thank you.

248
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:20,410
W-We should go, Kei.

249
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:21,872
Huh? You are leaving now?

250
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,048
Knowing you're okay is enough for me.

251
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:26,744
Huh? Is that so?

252
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,424
Here, this is for you. A consolation gift.

253
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:34,368
You don't need to see us out.
Remember to lock the door.

254
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,216
Okay.

255
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:45,544
You're here again. What is it this time?

256
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,496
You're always like this.

257
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,472
Na-Natsukawa Aika!

258
00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:53,840
I have something to discuss with you!

259
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,384
Excuse me, what's the matter?

260
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,608
Even if you are good, in second place,

261
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,160
and a little bit cute--

262
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,608
You're indeed very cute.

263
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,736
Huh? Uh… Thank you.

264
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:18,150
I-I bestow upon you,
who is slightly above average,

265
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,048
the right to cheer for the top student
in the grade, Shinonome Claudine Marika.

266
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,850
So just cheer for her?

267
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:30,264
Huh? Cheer on!

268
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,008
No, no!

269
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,480
That's not what I meant!

270
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Natsukawa!

271
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:42,030
You have to cheer for me to

272
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,328
become the next student council president.

273
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,192
Huh? Can a first-year student
be the student council president?

274
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:50,512
Let me explain.

275
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,640
STUDENT COUNCIL OFFICE

276
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,704
All student council positions
are open to all grades,

277
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,544
whether self-nominated
or nominated by others.

278
00:17:57,168 --> 00:17:59,184
Hi, the walking student handbook.

279
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,104
Kaoruko, I doubt he is complimenting you.

280
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:09,152
Having said that, first-year students are
typically at a disadvantage.

281
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:13,760
Since most people think only senior
students can be student representatives.

282
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:15,296
That makes sense.

283
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:20,328
The next student council president
should be Senior Kai, right?

284
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:23,800
Senior Kai stated that he doesn't want
to be student council president.

285
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,430
At the moment, no second-year students
have expressed interest

286
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,520
in running for student council president.

287
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:33,672
However, there will still be
candidates at that time,

288
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:35,710
so I must gather like-minded
individuals to assist me

289
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,616
in becoming the student council
president before then.

290
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:43,888
In a nutshell, you want Natsukawa
to be your ambassador.

291
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,776
You could say that.

292
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,728
What a terrible move.

293
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,296
What did you say?

294
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:53,752
I seem to have heard some nonsense.

295
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,696
Can you explain why you said that?

296
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:05,208
Because Natsukawa is too noticeable.

297
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,368
You're called Clau…Clauma, right?

298
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
What? Clauma--

299
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,648
If you make Natsukawa your ambassador,
the students will think,

300
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:19,232
"Is it that person who is running?
Why isn't Natsukawa?"

301
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:21,344
T-That's rude!

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,200
As a boy, I believe that

303
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,170
bringing Natsukawa in will
make you appear insignificant.

304
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,248
Wh-What do you mean by that?

305
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:40,288
Natsukawa is cuter than you.

306
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:48,168
I'll take my leave now.

307
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,840
How dare you…

308
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,032
Marika!

309
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,304
We should…

310
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,216
Probably leave.

311
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:05,000
This time we will leave. This time!

312
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:06,992
Goodbye, everyone.

313
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:10,672
Sajo, Sajo.

314
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:17,840
Huh? What? What's the matter?

315
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,000
It is all because you said
some shameless words.

316
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:22,688
Shameless words?

317
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:24,584
You said Aika is cuter.

318
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,016
Natsukawa must have heard
these words a lot.

319
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:33,488
Why are you still talking about it
after I have said it so many times?

320
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,048
Anyone would be embarrassed
if you said it so openly.

321
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:39,830
And the time and place are just right.

322
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,304
But Natsukawa's face is
now as red as "tendon" meat.

323
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,888
Sajo, put your boring joke aside.

324
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:51,560
Don't say things that
will make people shy!

325
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,552
I don't think you are over your cold yet!

326
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
So cute.

327
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,420
D-D-D-D--

328
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,232
Don't look!

329
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,632
SUMMER VACATION IS COMING. I WANT TO PLAY. GO STUDY.
For high school students about to

330
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,220
embark on their summer vacation,
the most important thing,

331
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,808
yes, is money.

332
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,330
A sense of meticulous calculation

333
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,620
is rather cool.

334
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,200
NO AGE LIMIT, NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED, RECRUITING PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO READ.
I will be able to get paid while also gaining valuable work experience.

335
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:57,710
I looked everywhere on the Internet and in
job magazines before I found this place.

336
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,274
BINAN BOOKSTORE, SECOND-HAND BOOK TRADING

337
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:01,336
Are you really okay with this?

338
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,984
That's enough.

339
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,080
Even though the hourly wage
is not that great.

340
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:09,496
Because I didn't want
that much pocket money.

341
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,904
I will be in charge of estimating value,
putting prices on books,

342
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,464
and managing stock. You will organize
books and serve customers.

343
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,730
That's all?

344
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:25,176
Being willing to assist me in serving
customers is already a god-like existence.

345
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,410
God?

346
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
I see, "God", huh?

347
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,552
There seems to be a lot to
learn about that, too.

348
