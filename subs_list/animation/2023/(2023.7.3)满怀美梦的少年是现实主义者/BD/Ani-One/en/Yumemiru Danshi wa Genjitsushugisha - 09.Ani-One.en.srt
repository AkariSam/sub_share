1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,200
I noticed a pair of shoes I did not
recognize when I got home from school.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,270
I instantly realized
they were Senior Yuri's shoes.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,320
But my mind was blank at that moment.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,370
I dashed to my brother's room

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,200
and opened his door without knocking.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,200
And then…

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,200
And then…?

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
An-And then…!

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,320
Then I saw Se-Senior Yuri being
pinned down by my brother.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,800
They were kissing…!

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,620
(A Cup of Coffee With a Milk to Coffee Ratio of 8:2)
In other words,

12
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,030
(Add a Teaspoon of White Sugar and Caramel Powder)
Ichinose is here

13
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,450
because she is having difficulty
confronting her brother.

14
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,840
She feels she can't go on like this,
and she needs to do something,

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,640
so she comes to work
in this second-hand bookstore.

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,560
Even though she wishes to
continue relying on her beloved brother,

17
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,560
she is unable to do so
because he has a girlfriend.

18
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
So she decided
to stop relying on her brother.

19
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,900
And, in order to foster
this spirit of independence,

20
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,880
she cannot easily give up her job.

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,270
That's how it is.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,640
I got it.

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
So Ichinose, you've made up your mind.

24
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,800
You have to work hard then.

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,030
Ichinose's work has been

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,180
consistently outstanding since then.

27
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,670
Maybe she took yesterday's incident
as a declaration of her determination.

28
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,760
She's full of energy now.

29
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,920
Good!

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,290
I always hear that working
allows one to bury the hurt inside.

31
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,400
Though I've only seen it
in TV shows or comics.

32
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,040
Leave it to me.

33
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,490
Thanks.

34
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,410
Ichinose's affairs
have always felt like my own.

35
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,610
So the remaining issue is,
of course, hosting customers.

36
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,750
Hosting customers?

37
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,700
Did you hear that?

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,700
Don't worry, I can handle tough customers.

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,350
Just watch me do it first.

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,370
We have a customer.

41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,770
Welcome.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,900
Welcome, Miss Sasaki.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,120
Ichinose, this is Miss Sasaki.

44
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,540
You may not believe it,
but she's a junior high school student.

45
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,850
Junior high school student…?

46
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,710
Miss Sasaki, this is Ichinose.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,830
She's new here
and is in the same grade as me.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,510
You're in the same grade as you, Mr. Sajo?

49
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,430
Nice to meet you, Senior Ichinose.

50
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,360
Uh, nice to meet you.

51
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,910
It's a rare occasion
for Miss Sasaki to come here.

52
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,200
Even though I'd like to talk
to her for a long time,

53
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm only thinking
about Ichinose at the moment.

54
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,240
No, wait.

55
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,580
Miss Sasaki, you and Ichinose
may get along.

56
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,680
Because Ichinose also likes reading.

57
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,720
Really?

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,120
I don't have any friends who enjoy
reading, so I'm glad to have met you.

59
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,710
Please be my good friend.

60
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,200
I do have a habit of reading, but…

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,690
Miss Sasaki seems very happy.

62
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,920
Perhaps the awkwardness
will fade away now.

63
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,960
B-But I'm working now…

64
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,410
Sorry.

65
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,520
No, it's fine.

66
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,560
You can swap with me
when the customer arrives.

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,020
May I ask what kind of books
do you usually read, Senior Ichinose?

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
I don't have any preferences.

69
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,630
I'll read it as long
as the title and cover appeal to me.

70
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,590
That's amazing,
you really like "books" themselves.

71
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,040
That's so cool.

72
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,800
Who's your favorite author?
What's your favorite genre?

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,920
-Even though you just said you don't have any preferences.
-I'll go sort out the books.

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,040
What kinds of titles and covers,
for example, would pique your interest?

75
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,390
How long does it take you
to finish a book?

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,240
It depends on the book.

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,930
Understand. Sometimes you want to
finish slowly and leave it for tomorrow.

78
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,410
In some cases, you finish a story
in one sitting because you're curious.

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,520
Do you have any recommendations?

80
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,960
Don't books recommended by people

81
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,360
who enjoy reading
feel a little more special?

82
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,060
Indeed.

83
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,550
Great.

84
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,080
-How about this one?
-Despite her reserved demeanor, she can now communicate.

85
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,920
I've read this before
and it's interesting.

86
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,720
So I'm recommending it to you.

87
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,400
-Wow, that's great!
-But no customers are coming. If this continues,

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,160
-Thank you for your recommendation,
-Ichinose can't practice on hosting customers.

89
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,540
Okay, let's pretend to be customers.
Scenario simulation begins.

90
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,040
Go for it, Senior Ichinose.

91
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,600
Why aren't there any magazines here?

92
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,430
There… aren't any.

93
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,600
Why aren't there any?

94
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,600
W-Why…?

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,930
I-I'll ask the boss.

96
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,570
Good, this kind of response is not bad.

97
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,140
Let me teach you another way to respond…

98
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,740
Where is she? She didn't
really go to the shop owner, did she?

99
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,520
Good, just do it like that.

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,970
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,860
It's okay, the boss is also happy.

102
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,080
Is this what part-time work is…?

103
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,960
Now it's Miss Sasaki's turn
to play the customer.

104
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,880
Can you play a troublesome customer?

105
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay! Leave it to me.

106
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,120
This is also a step towards adulthood!
It's social learning.

107
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,790
That's nice.

108
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,980
Don't worry,
everyone has their own strengths!

109
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,910
I-I'm going to start.

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,240
Hey, you bastard.

111
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,000
Thanks.

112
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,290
This troublesome customer
has a strong personality.

113
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you for your patronage.

114
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,720
I'll come again.

115
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,480
Senior Ichinose, by the way,

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,590
I'll finish the book you recommended
before my next visit.

117
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,440
Huh? There's no need…

118
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,900
She resembles a lily
of the valley swaying in the breeze.

119
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,800
Miss Sasaki was our only customer today.

120
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,840
-There will be days like this.
-Yes.

121
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,360
She's just like that,
please take care of her.

122
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,120
That's great. You'll have someone
to chat with after I quit.

123
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,570
You're quitting?

124
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,200
Don't you know? We began hiring
new staff because I am resigning.

125
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,250
As you can see,

126
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
this shop doesn't need so many staffs.

127
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,910
Although I'm not sure if you'll be able

128
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,920
to achieve your goal,
let me be your senior until then.

129
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,560
Thank you.

130
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,470
I'll go sort out the bookshelf.

131
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,660
Is it almost time to finish?

132
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,760
After the summer vacation,

133
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,090
I'll probably become distant
from Ichinose again.

134
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,600
But why would she talk to me
about her family situation?

135
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,050
HOW'S YOUR JUNIOR AT WORK?

136
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,050
I ASKED HER, SHE SEEMS
TO WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT.

137
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,050
IS HER SITUATION THAT DIFFICULT?

138
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,060
OTHERWISE, PEOPLE USUALLY
DON'T THINK ABOUT BEING INDEPENDENT.

139
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,310
YES

140
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,080
Huh? You're here?

141
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,750
A cup of coffee with
a milk to coffee ratio of 8:2.

142
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,230
Add a teaspoon of white sugar
and caramel powder.

143
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,940
Can you wait a minute for me?

144
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,420
It takes that long?

145
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I'll do it right now.

146
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,590
YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL US EVERYTHING
ONCE SCHOOL STARTS

147
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,690
Yes.

148
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,890
I got it.

149
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,660
Ichinose confided in me because she didn't
have anyone else to confide in.

150
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,890
At school, she's always alone.

151
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,070
At home, it's the same.

152
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,920
I wouldn't be hearing
about her family situation

153
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,030
if she had even one female friend.

154
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,020
-Not done yet?
-It's done. Coming right up.

155
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,890
Don't keep the customer waiting.

156
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,800
Sorry for the wait.

157
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,000
Geez.

158
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,600
Is there something on your mind?

159
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,570
No, why?

160
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,640
You're not drinking it anymore?

161
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,990
It's so bad!

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,400
You don't have to carry as much as I do,

163
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,000
just what you can handle.

164
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,090
Thank you.

165
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,890
-Here you go.
-Okay.

166
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,840
She looks like
a hardworking elementary school student.

167
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,840
Welcome.

168
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,930
Not bad.

169
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,350
EGG MOOD

170
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,110
OMELETTE RICE OF THE DAY

171
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,560
Brother.

172
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,410
Hello.

173
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,040
Yuri said she will
make omelette rice for me.

174
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,640
Mina, would you like to join us?

175
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm really looking forward
to your cooking.

176
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,470
Leave it to me, this is my specialty.

177
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,750
I can't wait.

178
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,120
My rice has the shape of a heart.

179
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,850
Not bad.

180
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,640
I wonder how it tastes.

181
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,410
Mina?

182
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,720
E-Excuse me…

183
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,790
BINAN BOOKSTORE
How do I do this?

184
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,960
This? First do this, then this.

185
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,730
Let me try.

186
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,560
First this.

187
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,050
Then this.

188
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,280
Perfect.

189
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,720
Speaking of which, Ichinose,
you're extremely gentle with the books.

190
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,320
Unlike me when I first started.

191
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,840
The boss chastised me and advised me
to be more gentle with the books.

192
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,540
I think this is a great thing about you.

193
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,270
Really?

194
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,760
Yes, I admire it.

195
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,840
W-What's wrong?

196
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,220
I think you shouldn't cover
your face with your bangs.

197
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,770
Oh no, what a pick-up line.

198
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,030
Ah! Don't misunderstand!

199
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,910
I-Is that so?

200
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,910
S-So cute.

201
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,750
Um…

202
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,570
Sorry, what's wrong?

203
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,980
No, nothing.

204
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
Am I about to retire too?

205
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,010
But, in this way, I can begin
the new semester with no worries.

206
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,280
Excuse me, may I ask…

207
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,540
What's the matter?

208
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,550
Senior Kuma. Does that mean…

209
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,520
Mina.

210
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:44,568
(Dreaming Boy is a Realist, The)

211
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:45,976
BINAN BOOKSTORE, USED BOOK RECYCLING

212
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,750
So you're here,
I had a hard time finding you.

213
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,410
Because you told Mom
not to tell me where you were.

214
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,440
By the way, are you about to get off work?

215
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,910
-Occasionally eating out together…
-No.

216
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,390
Mina. Sorry, who are you?

217
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,200
My name is Sajo.

218
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,170
I'm your sister's senior at work,

219
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,020
but we're classmates at school.

220
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,310
I assure you that I'm not in that kind
of relationship with your sister.

221
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,600
Sorry, Sajo, could you step aside please?

222
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,760
Oh, okay.

223
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,930
Ichinose?

224
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,000
She keeps looking at me.

225
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,090
No, wait, Sajo Wataru.

226
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,130
-It's my fault.
-Why is she hiding behind me?

227
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,300
-I'm sorry. I didn't consider your feelings.
-I don't know who to speak for.

228
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,130
How about we go somewhere cooler first?

229
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not the time to worry about that.

230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,900
Is it okay to leave your sister
out in this scorching sun?

231
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,100
Okay then.

232
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,920
There's a place nearby
where we can sit down and talk.

233
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,770
Senior, please use this.

234
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,800
Thank you.

235
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,640
It's indeed hot today.

236
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,150
Sorry, Sajo.

237
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,980
I was acting rashly right now.

238
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,320
It's okay, senior.

239
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,280
Mina, it's my fault.

240
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,090
Excuse me, Ichinose.

241
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,640
Do you know
why your sister started working?

242
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,840
I never asked her directly,

243
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,080
so I only know a rough idea.

244
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,280
Haven't you guys talked since then?

245
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,810
So that's how it is.

246
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,360
Mina, are you willing to listen to me?

247
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,220
What do you want to say, brother?

248
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,440
It was my fault for
not paying attention to you

249
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,140
after I started dating Yuri.

250
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,500
Let's be together like we used to,
reading books and sleeping together.

251
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,640
Brother, you belong to Senior Yuri now.

252
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,080
Yuri won't mind these things.

253
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,760
But… it's not fair to Senior Yuri.

254
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,230
You don't have to worry.

255
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,450
Yuri is very understanding.

256
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,110
Can you understand me, Mina?

257
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,360
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ichinose!

258
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,360
Hey, you've got to be kidding me.

259
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,780
Yuri, you're here.

260
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,110
Because I think this is not only
a problem between Ichinose and Mina.

261
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,530
May I ask who you are?

262
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,600
My name is Sajo.

263
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,950
I work part-time with Ichinose,
and we go to the same school.

264
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,120
My name is Hanaoka Yuri. Nice to meet you.

265
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,810
It's been a long time, Mina.

266
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,280
Yes.

267
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,240
I heard you suddenly started working.

268
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,190
Your brother and I were
wondering what happened.

269
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,720
But it seems to be my fault.

270
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,530
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,170
I intruded into your life without asking.

272
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,570
Part-time work must be difficult for you,
Mina, given your personality.

273
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,240
I think it's still too early for you.

274
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,450
It's not too early!

275
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,550
Mina, why have you become so stubborn?

276
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,720
You've never been like this before.

277
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,400
I also don't want Ichinose's family
to suffer as a result of this.

278
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,250
Please, come back.

279
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,240
Excuse me, could you hear her
out a bit more?

280
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,560
Ichinose is really hardworking.

281
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,530
She's very proactive about her job.

282
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,470
"Proactive"?

283
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,340
That's what I think.

284
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,530
It's natural for you to begin dating
and leave her alone,

285
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,450
and for her to decide

286
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,120
to be independent as a result.

287
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,630
You may have a point.

288
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,430
Mina is shy. She obviously
forces herself to do this.

289
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,320
That's right,
we genuinely care about Mina.

290
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,240
Seniors, do you know
how old Ichinose is this year?

291
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,400
She sincerely wants to bless you.

292
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,930
And chose this path because of that.

293
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,580
Are you planning
to take away this opportunity?

294
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,810
We didn't…

295
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,620
I don't have the authority
to order you to leave her.

296
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,490
But isn't it incorrect to believe

297
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,550
that your sister
will always be by your side?

298
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,680
Will everyone's smiles fade if the sister
stops relying on her brother?

299
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,360
That's not true, is it?

300
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,130
As her senior at work, I've been
watching her develop. If you ask me,

301
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,150
Ichinose's future will be decided

302
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,750
when she can express herself

303
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,680
in her own words.

304
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,840
For the time being,
we've bought some time.

305
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,910
Hmm, thank you.

306
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,480
What's wrong?

307
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,620
E-Excuse me, did I do something wrong?

308
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,520
Because every time I make a mistake,
you come to remind me.

309
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,360
We're not at work now.

310
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,780
We know what's right
and what's wrong, don't we?

311
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,400
When I arrived here, I was thinking,

312
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,150
"I don't understand
other people's problems,"

313
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,430
so I decided to judge everything

314
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,890
as your senior at work.

315
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,600
Your brother showed up to pick you up.

316
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,950
This may seem right to others.

317
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
But,

318
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,800
in that case, what have you
worked so hard for so far?

319
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,540
Being scolded by rude customers,
apologizing to them,

320
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,710
even though it's something you're not
good at, you've overcome it one by one.

321
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,040
I've seen it all.

322
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,240
INTERN
You really worked hard.

323
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,410
Who's going to be able to handle it
if it all comes to nothing?

324
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,660
Ah, that…

325
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
CAMPUS OPEN DAY BRIEFING, THIS WAY

326
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,490
Good morning.

327
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,170
Natsukawa, long time no see.

328
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,080
Huh? You seem different somehow?

329
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,950
I got a bit tanned
and built some muscles.

330
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
Because I've been
running outside all the time.

331
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,800
Right, after all, sports clubs are busy.

332
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,680
Did you go somewhere fun
during the summer vacation?

333
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,140
I'll go get it for you, you sit down.

334
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

335
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,200
T-Thank you.

336
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,220
What's wrong? Sasaki?

337
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,730
No, nothing. It's okay.

338
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,610
Is that so?

339
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
Good morning, Ichinose.

340
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,960
INTERN
H-How is it?

341
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,160
Good job.

342
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,830
Hello.

343
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,360
I'm here again, Senior Ichinose.

344
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,970
Mr. Sajo, hello.

345
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,270
Welcome.

346
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,040
I've finished the book you recommended.

347
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,690
Huh? That's fast.

348
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,350
Yes, the final Strawberry Tart Operation
was really impressive.

349
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,420
I didn't expect the pastry chef
to be such a bad person.

350
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,330
I know. The clever foreshadowing and
the intriguing theme are both excellent.

351
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,870
You're at work now.

352
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,470
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,720
Chatting to Senior Ichinose was
so much fun that I got carried away.

354
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,890
I'm sorry.
