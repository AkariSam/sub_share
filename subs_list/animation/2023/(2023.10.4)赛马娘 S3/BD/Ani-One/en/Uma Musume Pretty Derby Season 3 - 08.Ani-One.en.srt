1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,240
You always outrun me,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,720
but not today.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,420
Keep it steady.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,360
I must run faster.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,800
She overtook her from the flank
with a tiny margin.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,760
Arima... Arima...

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
Let's win Arima Kinen.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,700
Kitasan, are you...

9
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,700
3 G1 WINS

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,950
0 G1 WIN

11
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,450
3 G1 WINS

12
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,910
0 G1 WIN

13
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,000
Miss Nature...

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,160
Help me, please.

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,910
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

16
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,520
"SHIRUKO"
You can have it.

17
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,480
"SHIRUKO"
Thank you.

18
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,180
"EPISODE 8: SOMETHING IRREPLACEABLE"
What's bothering you this time?

19
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,220
It's... about Diamond.

20
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,760
Oh? Did you two argue?

21
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,340
Not really.

22
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,740
She totally crushed me in Arima Kinen.

23
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,760
Crushed?

24
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,240
Did she?

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,300
You only lost to her by a tiny margin.

26
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
It was a thrilling race.

27
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,380
Look.

28
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,060
"NAILBITER! SATONO DIAMOND VS KITASAN BLACK"
It's on the news too.

29
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,118
"NAILBITER! SATONO DIAMOND VS KITASAN BLACK"
You can have ten rematches

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,872
"NAILBITER! SATONO DIAMOND VS KITASAN BLACK"
and the result will come back the same.

31
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,160
and the result will come back the same.

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,720
We all think you two are equals,

33
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,400
including me.

34
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,700
Why?

35
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,360
Have you lost your confidence
like you did last year?

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,460
No, it's not that.

37
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm still confident in myself.

38
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
It's just that Diamond is...

39
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,980
Diamond is simply too amazing.

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,580
Before the race, she gave out
this vibe that intimidated me.

41
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,840
Intimidate?

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,480
During the race, I was so anxious.

43
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,300
I was only slightly behind her,
but the gap

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,340
felt insurmountable.

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,820
Come on!

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,860
You are pretty good yourself!

47
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,640
At least that's what I think.

48
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,960
Nature...

49
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,820
Drink this now.

50
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,300
It'll lift your spirit.

51
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,900
It's sweet and delicious.

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,700
Right.

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,460
Thank you, Miss Nature.

54
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,800
Miss Nature again...

55
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,840
N—Nothing.

56
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,880
SHIRUKO

KAMO SHRINE

58
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,740
It's crowded today.

59
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,960
Yeah…

60
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
What should we do? Do we pray first?

61
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,320
Kita?

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,700
What's the matter?

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,220
I'm fine.

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
Are you sure?

65
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,360
-Come take a look!
-Yes.

66
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,320
Oh?

67
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,500
Have some amazake.

68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,660
Try our amazake.

69
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,340
-It's delicious and will warm your soul.
-Look, Diamond. Amazake!

70
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,040
-Best amazake in town!
-Let's get some.

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,560
-It's sweet.
-Hi, can I have some amazake?

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,900
Welcome.

73
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,500
1,000 yen, please.

74
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,720
Welcome.

75
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:39,980
Our charms

76
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
"SURE-WIN CHARM"
will not let you down.

77
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,880
will not let you down.

78
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,500
All right.

79
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,040
Can I have this one, please?

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,300
Sure, I've received the exact amount.

81
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,940
Kita.

82
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,740
Which charm did you get?

83
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,980
Uhm... A sure-win charm.

84
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,160
Oh?

85
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,280
Me too. We match.

86
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,600
Right.

87
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,300
Diamond.

88
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,340
What wish did you make?

89
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,400
Why do you ask?

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,760
You were all serious
when you prayed just now.

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,960
I made a wish to win more races.

92
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,180
I made a wish to win
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,340
Crown won the G1 in Hong Kong.

94
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,800
She inspired me to step
onto the international stage.

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,240
That's why you want to win
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe?

96
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,280
Mhm.

97
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,100
No Japanese horse girls
have ever won that.

98
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,600
Some entered the race with full confidence
but came out disheartened and quit.

99
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,500
That's why winning

100
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,060
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
is very important to me.

101
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,080
I want to leave a lasting legacy
as a member of the Satono Group.

102
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,460
I want to pave the way
for the future of Japanese horse girls.

103
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,360
They are so alike...

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Kita, will you come with me?

105
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,240
We can race in France together.

106
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,320
Me?

107
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Yes.

108
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,260
Well...

109
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,500
I hope to see you there, Kita.

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,880
Let's represent Japan

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
and race against other horse girls.

112
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,100
Let's see the world beyond our nation.

113
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
Okay…

114
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,160
I see it now.

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,580
Diamond

116
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,920
and Dura are so alike.

117
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,160
You have to be patient.

118
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,360
Verxina.

119
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,900
It's too easy to predict
where the ball will fall.

120
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,740
Let's swap.

121
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Done.

122
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,200
Why are you here?

123
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,000
No reason.

124
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,220
I don't need your encouragement.

125
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
You are as stubborn as always.

126
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,660
I was planning to buy you
a new pair of shoes.

127
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,540
No, thanks.

128
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,000
Geez.

129
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,580
Just let us help you for once.

130
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,920
I'm not like you

131
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
or Vivlos.

132
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,880
No, you're very much like us.

133
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,840
We struggle a lot.

134
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,640
What is it?

135
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,880
How is your injury?

136
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,500
It hasn't fully healed yet.

137
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
I see.

138
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,380
But it will eventually.

139
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,940
It must.

140
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,500
My duty is to prove to the world
that I'm the best horse girl.

141
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,020
One day, I will climb to the top

142
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,980
on my own.

143
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,600
This injury cannot set me back.

144
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,940
You're so inspiring.

145
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,140
Inspiring?

146
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,900
You're always so upfront.

147
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,640
But of course.

148
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,020
This is why I run.

149
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,400
Right.

150
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,100
What about you?

151
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,200
Huh?

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,580
What makes you run?

153
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,060
What makes me run...?

154
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,660
The shiny thing before you
that you chase after,

155
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,260
the one thing you want to achieve,

156
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,620
the reason to keep you running.

157
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,900
I guess I run to win...?

158
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,340
And after that?

159
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,420
Huh?

160
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,540
Without a new goal,
you will cease to improve.

161
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,380
You must have something

162
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,440
you want to achieve, no?

163
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,360
I have never set my sights
on the international stage.

164
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,360
That's what makes Diamond and Dura
so inspiring.

165
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,780
What I want to achieve, huh?

166
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,400
I used to...

167
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,090
aspire to become Teio,

168
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,880
"TOKAI TEIO"
and be the star

169
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:01,590
"CAN TEIO DEFEAT THE EMPEROR?"
who makes everyone smile.

170
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,580
But it doesn't matter anymore.

171
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,580
Because I know I can never be like her.

172
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,400
Therefore,

173
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,120
I will run in my own distinct style.

174
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,580
I will win one race after another.

175
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,480
But

176
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,920
what I want to achieve,

177
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,400
what I will give my all to obtain,

178
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,420
I don't have anything

179
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,380
that I can call my dream.

180
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,280
Honey, honey, honey.

181
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,600
Once I have a taste of honey...

182
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,000
Done.

183
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
Welcome back, Kita.

184
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,580
Teio.

185
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Hi, Teio.

186
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,840
Well... I...

187
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
What's the matter, Kita?

188
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,950
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

189
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,960
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,700
One, two, three, four.

191
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,760
Teio.

192
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,080
Is it your dream to be the undefeated
triple crown horse girl?

193
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,100
That's right.

194
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,380
To be precise, I want to be someone
as awesome as Rudolf.

195
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,700
Have you watched her race before?

196
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,140
You'll be starstruck.

197
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,460
She's stronger,

198
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,740
faster, and brighter than anyone.

199
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,540
Every day, I tell myself to be
someone like her.

200
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,660
I want to be the undefeated
triple crown horse girl.

201
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,020
But I couldn't do it.

202
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,420
Despite all that,

203
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,560
you stuck to your dream?

204
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Mhm.

205
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,320
You keep chasing after your dream.

206
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,120
What keeps you going?

207
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,940
Well...

208
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,780
I missed out on the triple crown races
due to my injury.

209
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,160
Then, I went to watch Kikuka Sho.

210
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,040
I was moved.

211
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,260
Everyone raced
with their dream and pride.

212
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,080
They gave their all to win.

213
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,040
I think that's awesome.

214
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,600
It rekindled my spirit.

215
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,060
I can't be a triple crown horse girl,
but I still want to be undefeated.

216
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,420
I had a lot of doubts and second guesses.

217
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,880
I even changed my dream.

218
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,620
Still...

219
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,440
Someone gave me a goal to strive toward.

220
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,260
Someone told me not to give up.

221
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,060
Someone gave me a lucky charm.

222
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,900
Everyone is here for me

223
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,180
and that allows me to keep going.

224
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,820
And that day...

225
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,840
I was so happy.

226
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,740
Like I finally achieved something.

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,380
Achieve something...

228
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,900
And then,

229
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,820
I thought I would be content
since I achieved my dream.

230
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,500
But there's an overflowing sense of joy.

231
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,900
An overflowing sense of joy?

232
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,820
Yes.

233
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,860
It compels me to keep running.

234
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,760
I then noticed

235
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,190
"GO WIN ARIMA KINEN"
that I haven't become a strong

236
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,900
and awesome horse girl like Rudolf yet.

237
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,079
"SYMBOLI RUDOLF, ALL EYES ON VICTORY"
I can't be the undefeated

238
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:51,160
"SYMBOLI RUDOLF, ALL EYES ON VICTORY"
triple crown horse girl.

239
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,450
"SYMBOLI RUDOLF, ALL EYES ON VICTORY"
I was forced to give up on it.

240
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,200
But it's still buried inside my heart.

241
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,300
And so,

242
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,960
Dream Trophy became my goal.

243
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,680
No matter what, I will become
the Teio who surpasses the Emperor.

244
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,800
That thought alone has been
my motivation to persevere until now.

245
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,140
Heh!

246
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,760
I won't ask what's bothering you now

247
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
because I know you're stronger than it.

248
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm sure

249
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,560
there's something irreplaceable
inside your heart.

250
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,080
Teio...

251
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,340
Something irreplaceable...

252
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,800
One, two, three, four.

253
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,620
Two, two, three, four.

254
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,880
One, two, three, four.

255
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,980
-Two, two, three, four.
-Start running now.

256
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,840
Yes, madam.

257
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,780
The dream

258
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,020
I have never given up on

259
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,200
is Dad's performance.

260
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,000
It's the soul-healing stage that makes
everyone smile.

261
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,080
During Teio's race,

262
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,960
the audience was surrounded
by hype and loud cheers.

263
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,420
It was loud, festive,

264
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,420
and bright.

265
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,600
So bright that it dazzled my eyes.

266
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,760
I can still recall the scene vividly.

267
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,760
The clamor and the light,
I remember them all.

268
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,200
It still pains me to think

269
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,000
that I can never be

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,280
a shining star like her.

271
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,660
But...

272
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,100
Come take a look. Cheap deals!

273
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,040
Enjoy discounts during this special hour.

274
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,920
Don't miss out.

275
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,500
We recommend bananas today.

276
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,020
I will put up the best performance.

277
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,380
You can count on me.

278
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,740
Fresh bananas! Come take a look!

279
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,160
Welcome.

280
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,160
-Hi.
-Yes?

281
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,980
Hi, Kita.

282
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,400
It's cold today.

283
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
You're only wearing your tracksuit.
Won't you be cold?

284
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,980
I'm jogging right now.

285
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,960
Is that so?

286
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,060
You sure work so hard.

287
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,600
No... Not really.

288
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,640
In Arima Kinen, I...

289
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,080
Oh, right. I have something for you, Kita.

290
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,440
Give me a second.

291
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,720
Darling, where is the thing
I put away again?

292
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,220
What thing? Be specific.

293
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,860
That thing! The thing for Kita.

294
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,140
You always do this.

295
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,480
"ARIMA KINEN KITASAN BLACK PROMOTION"
You always do this.

296
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,640
"1 ONION FOR 1 YEN"
This thing, that thing, what thing is it?

297
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,300
This thing, that thing, what thing is it?

298
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,720
That thing.

299
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,220
"ARIMA KINEN KITASAN BLACK PROMOTION"
Welcome. Come take a look.

300
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,400
"ARIMA KINEN KITASAN BLACK PROMOTION"
Everything's fresh here.

301
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,180
Everything's fresh here.

302
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,860
Here you go.

303
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,820
I imported some great carrots.

304
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,480
You can have them.

305
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,440
Are you sure?

306
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,880
Don't worry about it. Just take them.

307
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
Treat yourself tonight.

308
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,800
Kita, you should have these tomatoes too.

309
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,300
They are very sweet.

310
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,080
I can't possibly accept them.

311
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,600
I insist.

312
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,360
Let us pamper you once in a while.

313
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,460
After all, you're the star of this street.

314
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,000
Star...

315
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,300
That's right.

316
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,720
Take this fish with you too.

317
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,700
Kita, this is our latest product.
You like honey, don't you?

318
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,840
Take this manju with you.

319
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,620
Have this meat too.

320
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,460
Do you want some apples?

321
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,480
Take some pastries with you.

322
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,140
I saved you the freshest fish.

323
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,440
She can't carry everything back.

324
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,300
She can use my basket.

325
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,040
I...

326
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,100
It's all we can do

327
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,360
to cheer for you, Kita.

328
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,460
Mhm.

329
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,400
You did so well in Arima Kinen.

330
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,220
I shouted so much that my throat hurt.

331
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,240
It is very memorable.

332
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,160
Especially the last sprint
before the finishing line.

333
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,840
It brings me to tears
whenever I think about it.

334
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,940
That soul-healing stage
that makes everyone smile.

335
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,080
It's loud, festive,

336
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,540
and bright.

337
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,980
So bright that it dazzles my eyes.

338
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,620
My first dream...

339
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,420
I buried it away in my heart.

340
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,200
I gave up on it. But...

341
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,720
Kita.

342
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
Are you hurt or something?

343
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,340
No, not at all.

344
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,080
I... I...

345
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,940
Thank you so much.

346
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,360
Wait.

347
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,280
Kita.

348
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,720
Kita!

349
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,800
Where did Kita go?

350
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,040
I'm back.

351
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,580
Kita, you're back.

352
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,380
What's with the basket?

353
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,280
Bye.

354
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,200
"SYMBOLI RUDOLF, ALL EYES ON VICTORY"
I feel good.

355
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,120
I feel good.

356
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,060
All the best, Kita.

357
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,700
I like to see a smile on everyone's face.

358
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,540
I want to be at a place where everyone
is enjoying themselves, like a festival.

359
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,740
I can't have enough

360
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,120
of the moment Teio created.

361
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,840
I cannot be like Teio.

362
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,640
I cannot shine like her.

363
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,920
I am not a prodigy.

364
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,580
So I gave up on my dream.

365
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,060
But this is different
from my true calling.

366
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,160
The truth will never change.

367
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,040
I cannot become a prodigy.

368
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
I cannot become a star.

369
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,720
I know that. I'm aware of that.

370
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,320
But I don't want to give up.

371
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,800
I want to chase after my dream.

372
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I want to find my dream again.

373
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,140
I want to create the moment.

374
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
I want it.
