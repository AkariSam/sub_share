00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,520
Kitasan.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,460
Morning.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,620
You're training hard today as well.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,160
Have you decided on which race is next?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,700
I'm thinking Takarazuka Kinen.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,660
If they choose me, that is.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,300
Takarazu… On a…

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,620
Yes?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,040
Sorry for the intrusion.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,080
Kitasan Black.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,520
Yeah?

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,100
Sorry to have come to you
this early in the morning.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,600
Please come
to the student council with me.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,920

I'm chairing the executive committee?

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,140
Yes. Are you up for it?

20
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,700
But why me?

21
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,660
We're planning a new event this year.

22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,940
It's an event jointly held by the school
and the city council to revive the town.

As last year's horse girl of the year,

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
you are the best candidate.

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,900
Eh?

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,760
Besides, you also

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,440
have a nickname
that goes by "Festival Girl".

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,260
Well…

29
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,040
This event is similar to a festival.

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,880
You are close to the locals so you're
the best person for it, Kitasan.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,720
Festival…

32
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,360
Yes. I want you to make it festive.

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
What do you think?

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,820
A festival?

35
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,240
I see. I'll do my best.

As the chairwoman, I must
make this festival a great success.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,480
Morning.

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,260

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,020

I count on you for today.

Running a stall in a school

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,190
is quite the unique experience.

Yes, do enjoy the festivity too.

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,100
I need to get going.

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,720
-Good luck.
-All the best.

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,320
You can do this.

56
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,760
Kita.

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,780
Teio?

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,920
You look so handsome.

59
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,780
Rudolf did it once

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,760
so I want to try it out too.

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,520
Are you patrolling, Kita?

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,440
Yes.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,560
I'm so sorry that I can't help Spica out.

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,500
That can't be helped.

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,140
After all, you're the chairwoman
of the committee.

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,980
We can handle this.
You focus on your work.

67
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,640
If you're free later,
come and have some tea with us.

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,020
Thank you so much.

69

Baaaa.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,360
A sheep?

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
Wear your uniform already!

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,940
Do you even know the theme
of our cafe here?

76
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,780
Let me be. I want to dress up like this.

77
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,800
A butler should wear a sheep overall.

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,580

You too, Crown.

Thank you for your hard work
as the chairwoman.

95
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,380
Kitasan, you're participating
in Takarazuka Kinen, aren't you?

96
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,440
Even though I lost to you
in the fans' voting,

97
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,080
I won't lose to you during the race.

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,180
Me neither. I won't lose to you.

99
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,660

I thought about it for a long time.

103
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,120
This autumn, I have to give my all.

104
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,720
For Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, right?

105

Oh, Diamond…

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,280
I see.

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,860
I'll go back to my patrol duty then.

108
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
Okay.

I can't wing it.

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,340
So, did you have fun today?

130
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,560
Yes, it's the perfect break for someone
who does physiotherapy every day like me.

131
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,100
I heard you are the chairwoman.

132
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,640
How is everything?

133
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,700
Well, I'm enjoying it.

134
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,640
Everyone is smiling

135
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,800
and that makes me feel energized.

136
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,620
I see.

137
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,220
This is the view you created.

138
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,100
Huh?

139
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,540
I… I'm not that good yet.

140
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,760
But you can still…

141
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Huh?

142
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,700
One day, I'll create a view
as good as… No.

143
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,880
A view more memorable than yours.

144
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,260
When I win Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

145

Yes.

147
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
I'll prove that I'm the best horse girl

148
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,000
and everyone in Japan
will cheer loudly for me.

149
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,060
Everyone in Japan, huh…

150
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,340
Welcome.

151
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,000
-Come.
-What do you think?

152
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,200
If I win,

153
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,360
everyone will smile
from the bottom of their heart.

154
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,920
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
is capable of doing that, right?

155
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,600
Yes.

156

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,560
But I wasn't very popular back then.

187
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,040
Satsuki Sho and Derby…

188
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,460
It was a very difficult period.
Defeating too.

189
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,940
Yes, but you survived it.

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,100
St. Leger Stakes.

191
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,540
And Kikuka Sho.

192
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,040
Arima Kinen and Osaka Hai.

193
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,460
My first Tenno Sho in Spring.

194
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,720
And Takarazuka Kinen.

195
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,880
During the Kyoto Daishoten,
you were the most popular horse girl.

196
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,520
I was so nervous
back then for some reason.

197
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,960
Then, I won Japan Cup.

198
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,820
I raced with Diamond in my second
Takarazuka Kinen.

199
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,260
I was in a lot of tournaments.

200
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,180
Yes, you were.

201
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,340
And next up is Takarazuka Kinen?

202
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,880
Yes.

203
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,920
No horse girl has been able to obtain
triple crown as a veteran.

204
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,400
It's a physically demanding feat.

205
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,180
But I know you can do it.

206
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,540
Mr. Trainer.

207
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,460
Yeah?

208
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,180
I will win Takarazuka Kinen.

209
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,920
Then, I want to

210
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,080
go international.

211
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,000
I've been thinking about

212
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,060
what I can do to make everyone happier.

213
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,560
I thought that by carrying everyone's
hopes and dreams

214
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,080
while I pass the finishing line

215
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,700
as the first place,
I would have my answer.

216
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,120
-Burn brighter.
-Everyone is smiling.

217
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,380
-Burn brighter.
-They have fun. They enjoy the moment.

218
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,680
-Burn brighter.
-It's like a festival.

219
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,360
I want to create that moment.

220
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,060
I see.

221
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,700
I get it now.

222
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,420
I'll help you sign up for
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

223
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,900
Thank you.

224
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,560
Well, Mr. Trainer,

225
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,960
the campfire party has begun.

226
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,540
Hurry up now. Everyone's waiting for you.

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,010
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

228
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,740
Really? You're participating
in Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe too?

229
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,320
Yes. I've been thinking about it.

230
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
You need to recover faster then.

231
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,080
Yes.

232
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,240
You must have overworked yourself.

233
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,440
After the festival, you can rest.

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,620
I guess.

235
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm off then.

236
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,040
Take care.

237
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,360
Thank you for your guidance.

238
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,460
What happened?

239
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,820
I think she is quitting.

240
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,720
Eh.

241
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
It's common to see horse girls quit
after they reach their ceilings.

242
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,940
I see.

243
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,940
Lie down now and rest well.

244
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,000
All right?

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,060
Oh, Diamond.

246
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,700
Can I borrow something?

247
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,060
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

248
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,040
"DIAMOND'S READING REGARDING THE PRIX"
Held in France in autumn,

249
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,140
"DIAMOND'S READING REGARDING THE PRIX"
this grand event gathers

250
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,280
all Derby horse girls.

251
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,720
"PAST JAPANESE CHALLENGERS"
Japanese horse girls have signed up for it

252
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,480
"PAST JAPANESE CHALLENGERS"
but they all lost.

253
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,440
If I win in this race,

254
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,620
I will literally overwrite
the Japanese racing history.

255
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,160
A grand event, huh?

256
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,300
It sounds daunting.

257
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,960
If I participate in it…

258
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,500
No, to win it, I…

259
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,220
All right then.

260
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,960
Sorry for the trouble, everyone.

261
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,700
Are you fully recovered?

262
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,560
Yes, I am.

263
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,580
Don't force yourself now.
It'll be bad if your cold comes back.

264
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,100
I'm fine. I only need a good sleep
to treat something as trivial as a cold.

265
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,840
Either way, I have to catch up
for my missed training yesterday.

266
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,560
You just recovered from a cold.
Don't push yourself too far.

267
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,340
I know… But if I don't work hard enough,

268
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,140
I won't be able to create a festive wave.

269
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,800
A festive wave?

270
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,200
Yes, a festive wave.

271
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,800
All right. Another lap then.

272
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,980
Wait!

273
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,400
"BIG SONG BAR"
Kitasan wants to compete internationally?

274
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,800
Yes.

275
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,320
But you don't look too thrilled about it.

276
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,760
You're against the decision?

277
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,840
I do think that she has what it takes
to compete internationally.

278
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Truth be told, I feel uneasy.

279
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,740
It's a long race,
unlike any other race we have here.

280
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,720
I also wonder if Japanese horse girls
can get used to their turf.

281
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,200
Not to mention that I have to hand
a lot of things over to a foreign trainer.

282
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,980
Many are horse girls
whose growth was stumped

283
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,860
because they forced themselves
to adapt to a foreign environment.

284
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
It's not uncommon.

285
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,120
Besides…

286
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,480
Never mind.

287
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,540
Ow.

288
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,200
Cheer up.

289
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,320
You can't beat yourself up like this.

290
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,920
Yes, before we make the decision, only
God knows what's good for us.

291
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,900
If you want to know more about
international races, you can ask her.

292
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,120
Sorry, I'm late.

293
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,500
Hello, what would you like to order?

294
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,020
Uhm…

295
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,460
They have milk here too.

296
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,780
In that case…

297
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,160
Tequila straight, in a tankard.

298
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,140
Eh?

299
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,320
MOUNT KINTOKI, SUMMIT,
1,212M ABOVE SEA LEVEL

300
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,180
Spring G1 has ended.

301
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,600
The grand event, Takarazuka Kinen,
is about to begin.

302
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,720
The most popular and also

303
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,520
the fans' favourite,
Kitasan Black, is here.

304
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,100
She won Osaka Hai and Tenno Sho. If she
wins this, she'll have the triple crown.

305
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,140
I can't wait to see her performance later.

306
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,840
I will win this race and go to France.

307
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,380
I will win this G1 race.

308
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
I must win.

309
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,820
I don't want to live in regrets again.

310
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,520
I have to win.

311
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,440
Kitasan Black
enters the horse gate calmly.

312
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,300
Satono Crown is the last
to enter the gate.

313
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,160
After a heavy rain,
this grand event in Hanshin Racecourse

314
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,980
begins now.

315
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,700
All horse girls bolt out at the same time.

316
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,660
Kitasan Black is off to a beautiful start.

317
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,660
She's trying to get the lead.

318
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,300
Flying Turkey charges out and…

319
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,580
What? Cheval Grand is in the lead.

320
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,400
What a surprise from Cheval Grand.

321
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
Behind her is Moon Hero.

322
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,960
Then, it's Kitasan Black.

323
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,380
She secures a good spot.

324
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,580
Cheval?

325
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,660
No, I must maintain my tempo.

326
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,480
On the inside line is Ribbon Gavotte.

327
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,200
Opheryu and Satono Crown
are in the middle.

328
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,800
Then, it's Ribbon Pastoral.
Seventh Queen is on the flank.

329
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,420
Behind them are
Brave Target and Original Shine.

330
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,540
Onward to the first bend,

331
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,940
I wonder what Cheval Grand's plan is
to maintain his lead.

332
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,320
Despite losing her lead, Kitasan Black

333
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,680
continues to run for her third G1 victory.

334
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,740
The horse girls
are heading to the stretch.

335
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,580
Cheval Grand still has the lead.

336
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,300
Half a length behind her is Moon Hero.

337
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,780
Kitasan Black is on the flank.
She's in the third place today.

338
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,800
Satono Crown closes in.

339
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,680
Kitasan hasn't accelerated.

340
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,540
Indeed.

341
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,780
This is not her usual self.

342
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm sure Kitasan will do just fine.

343
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,340
The first 1,000-meter lap was completed
in 1.06 minutes.

344
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,140
-The race is slower than before.
-If I accelerate now…

345
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,800
Here!

346
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,940
After the third bend,
everyone starts to accelerate.

347
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,620
Cheval Continue still takes the lead.

348
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,020
On the flank is Moon Hero.

349
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,460
Then, Kitasan Black.

350
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,640
When will she accelerate?
Can she overtake others?

351
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,240
This is weird.

352
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,620
Nothing. Kitasan Black
still hasn't shown anything.

353
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
Cheval Grand slowly widens the gap.

354
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,740
Satono Crown and Original Shine
approach from the flank.

355
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,180
Is Opheryu trying to overtake them
from the inside line?

356
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,800
All horse girls have
merged into a group now.

357
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,900
They pass the final bend en masse.

358
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,400
Kitasan Black charges in.

359
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,060
-Go, Kitasan!
-Kitasan Black charges in.

360
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,660
Moon Hero is in first place now.

361
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,460
Satono Crown and Kitasan Black
close in from the flank.

362
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,680
Onto the final stretch.

363
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,900
Can Kitasan Black outrun everyone?

364
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,260
What? Kitasan Black is panting?

365
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,520
Kitasan Black cannot accelerate.
She can't.

366
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,780
She lost her burst.

367
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,820
Why?

368
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,500
Satono Crown
slowly closes in from the flank.

369
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,300
Kitasan Black slowed down.

370
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,940
The fans' favourite,
Kitasan Black, is losing.

371
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,720
Satono Crown goes shoulder-to-shoulder
and continues running forward.

372
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,060
Satono Crown overtook her!

373
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,600
Opheryu is on the inside line.

374
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,900
Seventh Queen chases behind her
from the flank.

375
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,280
Oh, Satono Crown.

376
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,740
She wants to leave them behind
and she sprints!

377
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,520
Satono Crown. It's Satono Crown!

378
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,300
Satono Crown finishes the race
in first place.

379
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,160
Opheryu takes second.

380
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,420
Seventh Queen is third.

381
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,360
I can't believe Satono Crown won.

382
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,880
Kitasan Black was defeated.

383
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,900
I did it.

384
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,660
I won!

385
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,760
I did it!

386
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,240
Congratulations, Crown.

387
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,840
How can this be?

388
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,720
How can this be?
