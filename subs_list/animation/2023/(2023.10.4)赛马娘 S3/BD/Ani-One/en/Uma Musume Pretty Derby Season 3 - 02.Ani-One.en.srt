1
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,000
DURAMENTE,
THE NEXT TRIPLE CROWN HORSE GIRL

2
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,940
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

3
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,340
Remember,

4
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,360
maintain your pacing during the race.

5
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't be intimidated by your rivals.

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,260
Yes, sir.

7
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
NICE NATURE

8
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,060
"IKUNO DICTUS, TWIN TURBO"
You idiot!

9
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,060
"MATIKANE TANNHAUSER"
You idiot!

10
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,490
DURAMENTE

11
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,280
So far away.

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,200
I can't even catch her shadow.

13
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,100
I…

14
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,360
All good, Kitasan?

15
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,180
Well, I was thinking if I put you back
on your training too soon after Derby.

16
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,480
Maybe that's what's keeping you
from concentrating.

17
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,240
No, I…

18
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,720
You should focus on recuperating for now,

19
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,580
so let's call it a day here.

20
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,240
Okay.

21
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,220
TOKAI TEIO
CAN TEIO SURPASS THE EMPEROR?

22
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,510
TEIO'S RACE

23
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,480
Today's special is about

24
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,310
Duramente, who won
Satsuki Sho and the Japanese Derby.

25
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,800
DURAMENTE SPECIAL, FUTURE TRIPLE CROWN

26
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,540
"DURAMENTE SPECIAL, FUTURE TRIPLE CROWN"
She is expected to win

27
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,810
"DURAMENTE SPECIAL, FUTURE TRIPLE CROWN"
her triple crown this year.

28
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Thanks to her
extraordinary agility, strength,

29
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,070
and special gait that draws attention,

30
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,240
"SECOND TO NONE PERFORMANCE"
and special gait that draws attention,

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,333
"SECOND TO NONE PERFORMANCE"
she is often compared to Symboli Rudolf,

32
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,580
"SECOND TO NONE PERFORMANCE"
Tokai Teio,

33
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,980
"OWNER OF TWO CROWNS SO FAR"
and Narita Brian.

34
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,560
"OWNER OF TWO CROWNS SO FAR"
Duramente reminds everyone

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,640
"OWNER OF TWO CROWNS SO FAR"
of these legendary horse girls.

36
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,040
"OWNER OF TWO CROWNS SO FAR"
And that is part of her charm.

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,140
I aspire, yearn

38
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,360
to be like her.

39
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,900
I thought I could make it.

40
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,560
I thought I could shine on the stage

41
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,220
and be cheered on.

42
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,680
I would become a star like my father.

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,540
I wanted to be like that.

44
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,960
And one day, that dream took a form.

45
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
-Tokai Teio made a beeline to the line.
-That day…

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,300
There she goes!

47
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,360
Three racers
are vying for the second place.

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Tokai Teio!

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,540
As if trying to prove herself,

50
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,740
she pulls further and further ahead.

51
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,060
How formidable!

52
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,220
Tokai Teio

53
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,320
finished the race in the first place!
She did not disappoint!

54
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,560
What a performance!

55
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,840
And she just debuted. She's so good!

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,140
Wow.

57
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,320
-Wow!
-I was drawn to her right away.

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,660
She's fast,

59
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,400
beautiful, and awesome.

60
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,740
If I can

61
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,260
run like her…

62
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,020
I want to be like Teio.

63
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,370
I want to be close to her,

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,990
"FINISHING LINE"
to her awesome performance.

65
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,040
Even one step behind her will do.

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,520
I want to run with her

67
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,060
and admire the same view as her.

68
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,040
We will experience the same thing.

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,480
I want to be a horse girl like that.

70
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,400
Regardless of seasons,

71
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,940
weather,

72
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,980
when I'm going through ups and downs,

73
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,740
when I'm alone or in great company,

74
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,880
whenever it is,

75
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,760
Teio's shining silhouette

76
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,960
is what

77
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,820
keeps me going.

78
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,480
Her silhouette

79
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,540
looks so distant,

80
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,400
but if I work hard enough,
I will be able to catch up to her,

81
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,360
to the dream I have.

82
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,800
My aspiration

83
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,440
is my motivation.

84
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,380
Welcome to Tracen Academy's
Orientation Day.

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,380
What is your name?

86
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,840
I'm Kitasan Black.

87
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,560
I'm Satono Diamond.

88
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,620
I will not forget your name.

89
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,640
The disadvantageous position
will not stop her.

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,920
Tokai Teio

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,820
is the champion of the Japanese Derby!

92
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,020
Tokai Teio!

93
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,720
Tokai Teio made a comeback!

94
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,420
She is amazing.

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,960
She shines so brightly.

96
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,200
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

97
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Today is the day, Diamond.

98
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,900
Let's work hard together, Kita.

99
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,820
Now that I'm in the academy

100
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,280
and have debuted,
I'm one step closer to her.

101
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,180
With that in mind,

102
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,700
I look ahead

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,120
and run.

104
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,560
I run and run.

105
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
But

106
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,960
deep down, I can feel it.

107
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,140
I

108
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,420
will never…

109
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,360
Be like them.

110
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm going for a small jog now.

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,020
Be safe.

112
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,940
Kita doesn't look that well.

113
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,500
I hope she is eating properly.

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,920
She has enough rest by now,

115
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,560
but her motivation is gone.

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,800
Forcing her to run at this point
is a recipe for disaster.

117
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
We can't rush her.

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,380
Shouldn't you be worried?

119
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,760
Our junior is in a slump.

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
She'll be fine.

121
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,320
Kita will be fine.

122
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,380
Have you heard?

123
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,381
It's huge.

124
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,560
Everyone in Spica
must be worried about me.

125
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,620
I have to get myself together.

126
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,000
Dwelling on it won't change anything.

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,780
But

128
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,380
no matter how hard I try…

129
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,140
A distal radius fracture that'll need
six months to recover.

130
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,020
She is unable
to take part in any races this year.

131
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,280
I repeat,

132
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Duramente, who won Satsuki Sho

133
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,200
"DURAMENTE, INJURED"
and Japanese Derby, is suffering

134
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,540
"UNABLE TO RACE IN KIKUKA SHO"
from a bone fracture.

135
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,440
from a bone fracture.

136
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,160
A bone fracture?

137
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,560
She was expected to win the last crown

138
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,300
this autumn in Kikuka Sho.

139
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,440
This news has made the outcome
of Kikuka Sho all the more unpredictable.

140
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,020
At the moment, Duramente boasts
a record of four wins out of six races.

141
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,000
She was the runner-up in two of the races.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,120
This year, she won Satsuki Sho

143
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,320
and the Japanese Derby,
two of the triple crowns.

144
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,400
One might say that she is
the best horse girl at the moment.

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,460
Many fans expect Duramente to win

146
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Kikuka Sho too,
which will take place in autumn.

147
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Her injury will undoubtedly
upset her loyal fans

148
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,140
as they look forward to watching
her win all three crowns.

149
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,740
Moving on, in the Grand Prix
that is happening tomorrow,

150
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,680
Takarazuka Kinen

151
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,960
-was voted for two years consecutively…
-I… I…

152
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,960
"UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3"
I suck.

153
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,100
She's fast and strong but she can't
take part in Kikuka Sho now?

154
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,020
Yes.

155
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,600
I didn't expect her injury
to be this serious…

156
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,660
This reminds me of you, Nice Nature.

157
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Can you believe it? Duramente is injured.

158
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,900
She's not going to compete in autumn.

159
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,300
You know she'd win

160
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,980
Kikuka Sho easily.
She'd have all three crowns.

161
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,240
But other horse girls now stand a chance.

162
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,880
Come on.

163
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,680
This reminds me of what happened to Teio.

164
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,380
Exactly.

165
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,760
I feel sorry for Duramente.

166
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,340
Me too.

167
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,585
I wonder if Kita is doing all right.

168
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,800
She should be back soon.

169
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,100
When she knows that Duramente is injured…

170
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
She will be devastated.

171
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,460
She was hoping for a rematch.

172
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,428
Yeah.

173
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,340
To be denied a rematch,

174
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,580
I know how bad this feels.

175
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,560
Let's cheer her up once she's back.

176
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,060
We'll help her regain her focus
for the next race.

177
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,160
Okay.

178
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,040
Should I make a nutritious drink for Kita?

179
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,162
You should!

180
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,920
I… I…

181
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,800
Are you all right?

182
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
Nice Nature…

183
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,920
-I know.
-Turbo.

184
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,760
Here.

185
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,991
Thank you.

186
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,400
You're welcome.

187
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,480
Tannhauser bought it but no one

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,080
wanted to drink it.
I was trying to get rid of it.

189
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,540
Are you skipping your training?

190
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,380
You lazy bum.

191
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,980
Is it about Kikuka Sho?

192
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,180
Maybe I can help you if you tell me
what's bothering you.

193
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,300
Certain things are easier to talk about

194
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,120
when you're with strangers
instead of friends.

195
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,260
I can be your listener.

196
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
It's bitter.

197
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,600
I aspire

198
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,940
to be someone like Teio,

199
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,340
to be a star like her.

200
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,120
But I don't have it in me.

201
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,940
It's the truth.

202
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,400
Only people like Duramente
can achieve what Teio did.

203
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,980
She won Satsuki Sho and Derby.

204
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,860
She drew fans with her gait
and her awesome performance.

205
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,860
I have none of them.

206
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,180
After the news of her injury broke out,

207
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,900
everyone felt sorry for her because

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,380
she couldn't get her triple crown anymore.

209
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,880
And I noticed

210
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:03,552
that was what everyone did to Teio too.

211
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,060
It sucks that she can't attend
the next race because of her injury.

212
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,060
But everyone giving her attention

213
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
just makes me feel worse about myself.

214
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,280
I…

215
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,680
I even had the thought

216
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,280
that if she is absent,

217
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,400
maybe I can win Kikuka Sho…

218
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,640
People like me will never succeed,

219
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,760
will never be a superstar like Teio.

220
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,860
I get what you mean.

221
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,980
I

222
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,760
used to idolize Teio too.

223
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,240
She

224
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,240
was a natural-born superstar.

225
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,580
She's wonderful. She's honest.

226
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,740
She's hardworking.

227
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,360
And she has the talent.

228
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,380
After her injury in the Derby,

229
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,300
she did everything she could
to speed up her recovery.

230
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,220
Her perseverance inspired me.

231
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,140
It made me want
to join and win Kikuka Sho.

232
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,100
So I did. I won four races in a row

233
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,860
and got my ticket to Kikuka Sho.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,840
And then I thought

235
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,620
that if Teio couldn't make it to the race,

236
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,380
maybe I would stand a chance too…

237
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,180
Ultimately, I wanted to win.

238
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,680
Isn't that normal?

239
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,640
I don't want to be in third place
or second place.

240
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,100
I want to be the champion.

241
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,540
However,

242
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,900
when I had that kind of thought,
I felt ashamed,

243
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,480
mad.

244
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,400
Like what you're feeling now, Kita.

245
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,660
Nature…

246
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,120
It's a bittersweet feeling, isn't it?

247
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,200
People talk about either

248
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,240
Teio or Duramente.

249
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,380
They think other candidates
in Kikuka Sho are bad

250
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,940
and that if Duramente was there,
she would surely win it.

251
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,740
I was angry when I heard those things.

252
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,220
So I decided to win.

253
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,700
I wanted them to notice me.

254
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,320
I wouldn't let them think that I won
because Teio was absent.

255
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,840
I ran with that in my mind,

256
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,700
till they noticed me.

257
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,660
Even though I might be weak,
lame, and opportunistic,

258
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,900
I found myself that day.

259
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,000
I think that was the beginning
of my journey.

260
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,920
Even though I only got
fourth place in the end.

261
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,360
Beginning of the journey…

262
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,000
Giving my all…

263
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,200
Finding myself…

264
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,740
How do I find myself on the track?

265
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,800
That's a difficult question.

266
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,220
I'm still trying to find an answer.

267
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,800
I don't have confidence either.

268
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,940
After Derby, I feel inadequate.

269
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,300
I get it.

270
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,840
I always feel inadequate as well.

271
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,740
But…

272
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,260
Still…

273
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,580
I…

274
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,540
I want to win.

275
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,100
I want to win more races.

276
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,820
Prove the naysayers wrong then.

277
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,380
Can I do it?

278
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,760
Definitely.

279
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,440
You're better than me.

280
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,760
Even though I'm weak, lame,
and maybe opportunistic?

281
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,780
All of them

282
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,220
are part of you, aren't they?

283
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,700
I see.

284
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,860
Thank you.

285
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,900
Nature, you are a great company.

286
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,600
What are you on about?

287
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
Drink some tea.

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,180
Okay.

289
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,280
It is bitter.

290
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,540
I knew it.

291
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,130
She hasn't returned.

292
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,700
She must still be upset about Duramente.

293
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,680
Yeah.

294
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,700
It's okay.

295
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,180
She'll be fine
after this nutritious drink.

296
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,200
I'm back.

297
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,500
-Kitasan.
-Kita.

298
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,562
U—Uhm…

299
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,460
I will continue to work hard

300
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,100
and I hope all of you
can continue guiding me.

301
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,080
Let's win Kikuka Sho.

302
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,360
Yes!

303
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,220
I'll get some training done now.

304
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,080
You can do it tomorrow!

305
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,600
I can never be someone like Teio.

306
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,560
And that's okay.

307
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm weak, lame, and maybe opportunistic.

308
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,100
But that's me.

309
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,340
I won't be a superstar.

310
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,040
I won't be the highlight.

311
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,900
I won't be the centre of the attention.

312
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,080
But still, I will climb.

313
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,340
I will get up.

314
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,240
The final race of Autumn G1 is here.

315
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,660
We are here at Kikuka Sho,
the last crown in the triple crown.

316
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,480
Albeit winning Satsuki Sho
and the Japanese Derby,

317
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,540
Duramente cannot be here
due to her injury.

318
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,020
I'm sure the fans here would love
to witness her triple crown moment.

319
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,480
What a shame.

320
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,300
It's okay if no one notices me.

321
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,660
I don't care if no one sings my praises.

322
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,280
I will find myself

323
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,680
on this track.

324
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,920
I will run for myself.

325
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
All candidates are now
at the starting gate.

326
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,560
In this breezy Kyoto,

327
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,720
who will win this year's

328
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,260
Kikuka Sho?

329
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,360
Go!

330
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,240
Kid Dansatsu is off to a late start.

331
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:43,625
She's way behind everyone else.

332
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,440
Go!

333
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
-We're heading to the bend.
-Go!

334
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,920
Parol and Ribbon Pastoral

335
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,900
are competing for the first spot.

336
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,620
Will this be a war of attrition?

337
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,740
The leading Parol and Ribbon Pastoral

338
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,320
are still moving forward.

339
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,340
They say only the best horse girl can win

340
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,400
Kikuka Sho, the last leg
of the Classic Triple Crown.

341
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,340
Do you know why?

342
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,240
Why?

343
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,700
Because you need both speed
and stamina in this race.

344
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,440
You have to overcome two slopes
and run a 3,000-meter track

345
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,320
to win.

346
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,420
Also, Kikuka Sho was inspired by
England's St Leger Stakes.

347
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,720
So it's also called
the Japanese St Legers.

348
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,560
Go, Kitasan Black!

349
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,860
How is she doing?

350
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,160
It seems like she is quite behind.

351
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,780
It's not bad.

352
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,540
But not great either.

353
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,780
So what is it then?

354
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,060
Do not underestimate
the length of the course.

355
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,080
Among the Classic Three Crown,

356
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,340
this is her first long-distance race.

357
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,140
So everyone is on equal footing.

358
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,160
With their eyes set on the trophy,

359
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,280
all athletes are doing their best
to perform.

360
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,020
They are now approaching the second bend.

361
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,860
In the second slope,

362
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,400
the ranking keeps changing.

363
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,380
I will climb.

364
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,200
I will get back up.

365
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,680
I won't give up.

366
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:55,235
I will run.

367
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,020
They have now arrived at the part
between the third and the fourth bend.

368
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,660
They will descend now.

369
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,300
Gentsu Steel occupies the centre.

370
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,080
I will not shine brightly
like a superstar,

371
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,740
but that is okay.

372
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,740
For I am Kitasan Black.

373
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,627
600 meters left. We are heading
to the fourth bend.

374
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,260
Go!

375
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,560
And now, the final stretch.

376
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,540
All horse girls are sprinting
with all their might.

377
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,660
Kitasan Black charged out
from the inside line.

378
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,740
I…

379
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,460
Will start from here.

380
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,320
Kitasan Black is accelerating.

381
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,360
Kitasan Black.

382
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,680
She overtook Jewel Sapphire from the side.

383
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,860
Gentsu Steel is in the middle.

384
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Gentsu Steel speeds up too.

385
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,905
She speeds up from the centre.

386
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,340
Kita!

387
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,920
Go!

388
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,440
Go!

389
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,460
Kitasan Black takes the lead.

390
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,320
A festival. This is a festival.

391
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,141
A Kitasan festival!

392
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,280
Kitasan Black won!

393
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,660
Kita!

394
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,720
Sheesh.

395
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,380
You are shining like a star too.

396
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,840
See? I told you. Kita will be fine.

397
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,641
We got all worried for nothing.

398
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,980
For all you know,

399
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,320
Kita might surpass me as a horse girl.

400
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,580
Shouldn't you tell her that yourself?

401
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,820
I will not because I don't want
to lose to her either.

402
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,380
Thank you!

403
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
This is the beginning of my journey.

404
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,760
It's not the most awesome start.

405
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,060
But it allows me to persevere,

406
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,980
to…

407
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,980
