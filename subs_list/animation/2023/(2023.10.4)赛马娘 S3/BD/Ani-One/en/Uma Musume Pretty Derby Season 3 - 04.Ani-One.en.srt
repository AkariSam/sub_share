1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,375
Oh, my. Spring is here.

2
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:17,042
Is that Kitasan?

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,917
Kitasan, what are you doing here?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,333
Miss Nature…

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,458
Again?

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,083
EPISODE 4: MY OWN LIGHT

8
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,375
You lost?

9
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,500
Yes.

10
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,625
I lost in yesterday's Osaka Hai…

11
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,375
I know I'm up against the best athletes

12
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:14,083
but I challenged myself
to win from the beginning to the end.

13
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:15,833
But…

14
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,292
I lost, by a tiny margin.

15
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,458
Just a tiny margin? That's a bummer.

16
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,750
Exactly.

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,583
I was 3/4 length away
from the first place in Arima Kinen too.

18
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,917
I just ran out of fuel in the end…

19
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,625
Now that I think about it,

20
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,708
I can't sprint as fast as Diamond
on the final stretch,

21
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,875
nor do I have the burst Duramente does.

22
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,750
It's bothering me

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,292
and it makes me anxious.

24
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,792
Hey. Calm down first.

25
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:55,750
We should get something sweet.

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,042
It's on me.

27
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,333
Don't worry about it.

29
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,708
Just tell me what you want to eat.

30
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,208
Miss Nature…

31
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,667
Stop right there!

32
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,667
You're not getting away today!

33
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,250
She's going berserk!

00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:19,000
Move aside!

37
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,583
That was close…

38
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,333
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

39
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,417
Are you hurt?

40
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm fine.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,375
I'm so glad to hear that.

42
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,083
Come with me now.

43
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,292
Are you sure you aren't injured?

44
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,125
Does it hurt somewhere?

45
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,542
I have always had a sturdy physique.

46
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,708
I never get sick or injured.

47
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,417
-A crab!
-Whether it's hiking or swimming,

48
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:00,167
-I caught one.
-I don't get tired easily.

49
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,208
When I was in elementary school,

50
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,083
-Relax.
-I only got a few scratches

51
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,625
-Kita!
-after I fell from the third floor.

52
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,917
Kita!

53
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,250
I'm very sure that I am not hurt at all.

54
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,292
Why?

55
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:20,042
Why don't you use your sturdy physique
to your advantage?

56
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,292
For example,

57
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,542
you can undergo an intensive training
that's beyond everyone's endurance.

58
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,625
Maybe that will help you win more races.

59
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,542
I'll ask the trainer about it.

60
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,500
No.

61
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,792
You have a sturdy physique

62
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,292
but you are not immune
to physical injuries.

63
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,208
But…

64
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,333
But I want to be stronger.

65
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,875
Please put me under intensive training.

66
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,583
No.

67
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,375
But Mr. Trainer…

68
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,542
He's right. You can't compete
when you're injured,

69
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,833
let alone win the race.

70
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,167
However,

71
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:04,208
you found a way to improve yourself
and you want to give it a try.

72
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,875
I know what you're going through now.

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,458
Teio, this is…

74
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,333
Please say yes.

75
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:16,500
I appreciate that you're looking out
for us, Mr. Trainer.

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,583
But

77
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,500
we run to win the race.

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,333
Suzuka, Teio…

79
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,708
I'm begging you, Mr. Trainer.

80
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,375
-Mr. Trainer.
-Mr. Trainer.

81
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,458
All right. I'll think about it.

82
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,333
Thank you!

83
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,083
-Yay!
-All the best.

84
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,083
Thanks.

85
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,292
-I'll talk to him.
-Thanks.

86
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,125
-I'll talk to him.
-I'll do my best.

87
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,333
I'll be your moral support.

88
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:09,542
Your final sprint is getting better.

89
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:13,750
I feel very motivated
as Satsuki Sho inches closer.

90
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,167
Yeah.

91
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,083
I feel that way too.

92
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,458
Back then,

93
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:24,333
I raced to break the G1 curse
on our family.

94
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,625
Crown…

95
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,042
I have high hopes for you.

96
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:30,417
Please get the first G1 win
for our family.

97
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:31,583
I will.

98
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,333
Kita, are you going out?

99
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,958
Yes, I start intensive training tomorrow.

100
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,583
For how long?

101
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,542
"BRING NO MORE THAN 300 YEN OF SNACKS"
Tenno Sho will begin in spring.

102
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,875
"BANANAS ARE NOT SNACKS"
Tenno Sho will begin in spring.

103
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,833
"WAKE UP AT 5 AM EVERY DAY"
So about a month, I think?

104
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,208
I'm sorry, Diamond.

105
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,750
I won't be there for you in Satsuki Sho.

106
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,042
What do I do? What do I do?

107
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,708
Maybe I can take a day off?

108
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,708
But I'll be in the mountains…

109
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,875
Don't worry. I'll win it.

110
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,667
I'll get first place.

111
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,167
Diamond…

112
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,458
Let's work hard together, Kita.

113
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,375
Yes.

114
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,083
It's going to be so lonely

115
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,583
when you're not with me.

116
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,625
Oh?

117
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,833
You know what?

118
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,625
Here.

119
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,167
Your brooch?

120
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,458
Think of it as a piece of me.

121
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,708
All right?

122
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,375
Thank you, Diamond.

123
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,000
You're welcome. We'll work hard together.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,083
Sure.

125
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,000
You can have this horseshoe then.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,625
It's so heavy.

127
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:51,042
I can't eat any more…

128
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't eat any more…

129
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,375
I can't eat any more…

130
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,167
Good morning.

131
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,292
You two are early.

132
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,042
Mr. Trainer?

133
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,875
What… What is this?

134
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,667
Aren't you here
for the intensive training?

135
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:47,458
So Bourbon is here to…

136
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:47,750
She will be your special coach.

137
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,542
"MIHONO BOURBON"
She will be your special coach.

138
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:50,792
"MIHONO BOURBON"
Truth be told,

139
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,583
I'm not familiar with intensive training.

140
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,958
I can't train you
by making things up on the spot.

141
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,750
I will show you no mercy

142
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,167
no matter how hard you beg.

143
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,542
Nice to meet you.

144
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,042
Nice to meet you too.

145
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:09,833
Rice Shower will be in charge
of your diet.

146
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,542
Hi, I'm Rice Shower.

147
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:11,958
I'll make delicious rice for you.

148
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,333
"RICE SHOWER"
I'll make delicious rice for you.

149
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,708
You're in for a long haul.

150
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,458
Stay strong, Kitasan.

151
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,417
I will!

UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

153
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,958
Four laps of sprinting on a muddy road.

154
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,083
10 laps of sprinting with tires.

155
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,417
10 laps of 1,000-meter interval running.

156
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,917
Break 100 bricks.

157
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,542
10 rounds of climbing.

158
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,667
Our goal

159
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:42,417
is to complete all those
within three hours.

160
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,167
Within three hours?

161
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,125
Is that even possible?

162
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,167
You will spend twice the allotted time
at the beginning.

163
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,792
But theoretically, the tasks are feasible.

164
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,542
You can do it.

165
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,917
Get ready now.

166
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,875
It starts now?

167
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,833
Go!

168
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,250
You have slowed down.

169
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,667
Yes.

170
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,667
I thought it'd be like a training
on a slope

171
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,250
but the road here is bumpy,

172
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,917
with various degrees of inclination.

173
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,708
It's more demanding for my leg muscles.

174
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,042
If I don't lower my centre of gravity,
I can't proceed at all.

175
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,167
Use all your muscles.

176
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,667
Yes…

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,583
Form. Your form is wrong.

178
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,708
Noted!

179
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,750
Here I go!

180
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,833
You need to focus.

181
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,542
Yes…

182
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,292
The next spot to grab…

183
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,792
That one?

184
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:18,875
Maybe that spot is better.

185
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,333
No, it's better to…

186
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,333
Focus as you find the best gripping spot.

187
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,125
You'll need to be decisive.

188
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,125
Yes…

189
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,625
How long did I take?

190
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,542
Six hours.

191
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,000
I expected that.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,583
You have a month

193
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,250
to shorten that to three hours.

194
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,375
Okay…

195
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,333
Let's eat now.

196
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,625
Dinner's ready.

197
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,292
Dig in.

198
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,000
Bon appétit.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,167
You can ask for seconds
if you're not full.

200
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you so much.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,625
It's delicious!

202
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,000
Rest your body in the hot spring later.

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,083
Hot spring?

204
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,583
Yay!

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,750
I'm fully rested now.

206
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,167
Ow…

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,667
I have never felt this tired before.

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,542
If I survive this, I'll become stronger.

209
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,708
I'll do my best tomorrow.

210
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,417
MISO MACKEREL, GRILLED MACKEREL PIKE

211
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
YOU CAN DO IT

212
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,458
You can achieve your time goal
consistently now.

213
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,083
Thank you.

214
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,792
Your weight is perfect.
Your form is flawless.

215
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,000
You're ready.

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,583
Winning the race is all that's left now.

217
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,542
I will win it.

218
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,500
My body is leaden.

219
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,625
Concentrate.

220
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,083
Pace your breathing.

221
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,292
Yes.

222
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,542
Yes…

223
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,583
This spot.

224
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,208
And…

225
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,875
Goodnight.

226
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,875
Rest well tonight.

227
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,375
Are you sure this is all right?

228
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,667
What are you referring to?

229
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,083
She has made no progress lately.

230
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,333
"TENNO SHO AT MAY 1ST, LET'S GO!"
She has made no progress lately.

231
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,542
"TENNO SHO AT MAY 1ST, LET'S GO!"
Her body is tired.

232
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,583
"TENNO SHO AT MAY 1ST, LET'S GO!"
Her morale is low.

233
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:38,875
The real trial begins now.

234
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:44,125
The true purpose of this training
is to help her overcome this wall.

235
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:49,750
Master came up with this training regime
for my comeback.

236
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,167
You mean Mr. Kuronuma?

237
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,000
Your will is the key
to winning a war of attrition.

238
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,750
In other words, you have to have

239
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,083
an unyielding determination to win
under extreme duress.

240
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,000
It's up to her now

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,333
whether she can find this level
of resolution or not.

242
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,542
I let Master down.

243
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,500
So I hope Kitasan,

244
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,958
who reminds me of myself,
can overcome this wall.

245
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,542
I don't think I can do it.

246
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,875
No, I can't give up here.

247
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:31,167
Diamond would have aced this in seconds.

248
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:35,792
Diamond…

249
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,917
Eh?

250
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,792
Tomorrow is…

251
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,500
Let me see.

252
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,500
Kitasan, the bread is ready.

253
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,875
Bourbon!

254
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,958
What's the matter?

255
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,417
I found this in Kitasan's tent.

256
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:04,292
I WILL REGAIN MY MOTIVATION

257
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:15,833
180KM TO NAKAYAMA RACECOURSE

258
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,125
G1 SATSUKI SHO

259
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,333
After the last bend,

260
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,917
Satono Diamond makes an appearance.

261
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,833
Super Mate is there too.

262
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,167
Diamond!

263
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,875
A 310-meter-long stretch

264
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,458
is the distance between them
and their dreams.

265
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,833
Lawnmower is in the lead.

266
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,250
Diamond is coming up on the flank.

267
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,208
Jewel Spinel…

268
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,292
Satono Diamond charges in from the flank.

269
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,208
Satono Diamond!

270
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,458
Diamond!

271
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,042
Lawnmower is still in the lead.

272
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,958
Behind her are Jewel Spinel
and Super Mate.

273
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,083
Diamond!

274
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Divinity accelerates!

275
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,458
Divinity puts everyone behind her.

276
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,500
Super Mate follows suit.

277
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,667
Divinity!

278
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,292
What a formidable sprint!

279
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,125
And she won't stop.

280
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,208
Divinity touches the finishing line!

281
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,250
She overtook all her opponents
in one swoop!

282
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,167
Her speed is unmatched.

283
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,667
1 minute 57.9 seconds is her time.

284
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,292
It's the best record in this course!

285
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,292
"DELIBERATING"
It's the best record in this course!

286
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,333
DELIBERATING

287
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,042
CONFIRMED

288
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,583
She was in a great form.

289
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,875
She failed to break her family's curse.

290
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,542
Diamond…

291
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,458
Diamond…

292
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,583
I will win.

293
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,958
I hope she's okay…

294
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,708
Do you agree with the scoreboard?

295
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,333
I accept the outcome.

296
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,875
If I'm faster,
the outcome will be different.

297
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,000
This just shows that my determination
to win isn't strong enough.

298
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:44,500
Some of the audience said that you
were cursed. Do you agree with them?

299
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,708
My performance in the Japanese Derby
will prove them wrong.

300
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,167
My name is Satono Diamond.

301
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,417
A diamond shines wherever it goes.

302
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,875
And it doesn't break easily,
regardless of the hardship.

303
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,167
The bread is ready.

304
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,208
It seems like you regained
your motivation.

305
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,333
Yes.

306
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,917
Let's continue, shall we?

307
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,708
The real thing begins now.

308
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,833
My body might feel heavy.

309
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,042
It might be difficult to lift my legs.

310
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,417
But I won't admit defeat.

311
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:39,667
I will forge on in the face of adversity.

312
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,500
Come what may,

313
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,167
I'll crush it.

314
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,083
Next time, I will…

315
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,792
10 seconds left.

316
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,958
I will secure it in my hands.

317
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:02,083
Victory will be mine!

318
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,083
You overcame the wall.

319
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,167
Let's win Tenno Sho this spring.

320
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,292
Yes!
