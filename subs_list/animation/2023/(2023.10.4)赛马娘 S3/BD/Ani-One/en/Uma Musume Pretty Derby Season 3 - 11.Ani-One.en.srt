1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,220
I'm off then.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,900
Please take care of yourself.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,240
I wish you a huge success.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,380
Thanks.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,400
I'll wait for you there, Kita.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,640
Kita?

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,540
Eh?

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,120
Make our country…

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,700
No, make the whole world
as festive as possible!

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,600
I will.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,040
See you at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,990
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

13
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,060
EPISODE 11: DETERMINATION

14
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm so full…

15
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,240
Oh, no, Diamond. It's late…

16
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,220
Oh.

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,000
I need to get up now.

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
TAKE FRUITS AND VEGETABLE

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,520
-Phew.
-You can handle that, love.

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,740
Morning.

21
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,240
Oh, Kita?

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,040
You're as energetic as always.

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,420
Eh? You're later than usual today.

24
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah. I overslept.

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,780
I heard about your new goal,
the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

26
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,120
Eat that and work hard today.

27
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,320
Thank you so much.

28
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,690
"PRIX DE L'ARC DE TRIOMPHE"
In Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe,

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,800
Japan's best result is
securing the runner-up position.

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,980
Only three horse girls
have achieved this so far.

31
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,740
They are Nakayama Festa,
El Condor Pasa, and…?

32
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,220
-Care to answer, Kitasan Black?
-What happened back then?

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,640
My body felt so heavy all of a sudden.

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,700
I couldn't even lift my leg.

35
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,600
-Kitasan Black.
-I should have

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,880
-Kitasan Black!
-been able to…

37
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,840
Yes! Tokai Teio.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,000
Incorrect.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,880
The right answer is Orfevre.

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,720
It's very important. Memorize it.

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,780
What? You said Tokai Teio
instead of Orfevre?

42
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,800
Well, I was spacing out…

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,520
Sigh. You can't slack off
because Diamond is no longer here.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,900
Right…

45
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,980
Cheval, you have a huge appetite today.

46
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,000
And I'm not full.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,740
You hit your growth spurt.

48
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,120
I'll wait for you in Arima Kinen, Kitasan.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,040
Huh?

50
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,640
Before you return from
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe,

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
I will win in G1.

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,780
Then, we race against each other
in Arima Kinen.

53
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,220
Okay.

54
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,300
I won't let you win that easily.

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,880
I too won my first G1.

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,700
The upcoming Tenno Sho,
Japan Cup, and Arima Kinen,

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,520
I will win them all.

58
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,820
When are you leaving, Kitasan?

59
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,760
Huh?

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,640
Uhm… I'm still deciding.

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,160
If you're serious about it,
you must get fully prepared.

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,980
Your previous performance will not
be able to secure you the grand prix.

63
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,800
Uhm…

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,940
You weren't feeling well
during Takarazuka Kinen, were you?

65
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,280
I guess so…

66
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,480
Cheval?

67
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm going back for seconds.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
Again?

69
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,400
If you don't mind, what about this?

70
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,400
Kitasan, you didn't eat a lot today.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,560
You didn't even finish your dessert,
the katsudon.

72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,660
I feel full.

73
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,780
Is it because Diamond isn't here?

74
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,120
Perhaps.

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,180
TOKAI TEIO
CAN TEIO OVERTAKE EMPEROR?

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,260
Morning, Diamond.

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
All right.

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,620
TRAINING BEGINS TODAY

79
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
IT'S RAINY TODAY,
SO WE ARE TRAINING INDOORS.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,900
Wait for me, Diamond.
I'll come to you real soon.

81
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,780
Go, go, go.

82
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,900
Go, go, go.

83
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,100
"DON'T USE YOUR PHONE WHILE WALKING"
Sorry.

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,890
"DON'T USE YOUR PHONE WHILE WALKING"
I didn't watch where I was going, so I…

85
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,560
No, I should be the one apologizing.

86
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,740
Anyway, I must go now.

87
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,760
Okay.

88
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,640
Good. The lap time is great.

89
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,780
Huh?

90
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,480
What's the matter, Kita?

91
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,960
Sorry. I must run another lap.

92
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,280
This is weird. What's going on?

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,340
I feel like…

94
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,480
Not bad, Kita.

95
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,000
My final sprint isn't fast enough.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
But you completed it
in around the same time.

97
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,100
Why? Is something out of the ordinary?

98
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,840
Let me run another lap.

99
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,420
Wait.

100
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,020
Don't force yourself
if you don't feel well.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,860
Perhaps you're still tired
from Takarazuka Kinen.

102
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,840
Let's call it a day here.
You should get some rest.

103
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,480
But…

104
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,540
Kitasan.

105
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,740
All right. I'll go back then.

106
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,260
She's…

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,840
Awesome!
You broke today's record in your last lap.

108
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,060
Yay!

109
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,000
Have some water.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
Thanks.

111
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,900
That's all for today.

112
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,760
Okay.

113
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,340
But I want to run one more lap.

114
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,000
The bottle!

115
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,600
And she continues to run…

116
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,960
How refreshing.

117
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,530
LUNCHTIME!

118
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,290
WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO FRANCE?

119
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,050
DIAMOND, I THINK SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH MY BODY.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,960
Take it.

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,540
I wonder how many sides you can solve.

122
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,860
I'LL LET YOU KNOW ONCE I PLAN
EVERYTHING. GOOD NIGHT.

123
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,800
I'm fine.

124
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,960
My body is fine.

125
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,300
I'll be fine.

126
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,420
I sleep well. I eat well.

127
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,620
My body is in tip-top shape.

128
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,400
If I train harder, I can…

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,860
If you train harder,
you'll regain your form.

130
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,740
Gold Ship?

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,320
But it never comes back, does it?

132
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,640
No matter how hard you try or train.

133
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,440
How do you…

134
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,640
Because I've been through that.

135
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,660
Huh?

136
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,380
Somehow, I am not able to accelerate.

137
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,880
I can't control my emotions.

138
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,240
I can't start properly.

139
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,200
Kitasan Black.

140
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,240
You have reached your peak.

141
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,600
DIAMOND,
I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY BODY.

142
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,980
DIAMOND,
I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY BODY.

143
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,320
Huh?

144
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,990
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

145
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,200
I see.

146
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,580
I truly hope you're wrong this time.

147
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,620
So in Takarazuka Kinen, you were…

148
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,660
Mr. Trainer.

149
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,020
Can I continue racing?

150
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,760
After you reach your peak,
you might still retain your strength.

151
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,500
But it will dwindle.

152
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,060
When does that happen?

153
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,520
Post-peak, things might play out
differently for every horse girl.

154
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,220
Some are downright too weak to compete.

155
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,900
Some see their strength fade away
over the course of their career.

156
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,180
But some regain their form.

157
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,760
That means…

158
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,520
That means I can continue racing, right?

159
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,660
Yes.

160
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,540
But what about Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe?

161
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,600
Many horse girls competed in it
but they couldn't win it.

162
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
To win it

163
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,640
is to rewrite our history.

164
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,780
But there are some caveats too.
You'll be far from home

165
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,500
and you might not be able
to adapt to their turf.

166
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,600
Think carefully before you decide.

167
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,620
Don't leave any regrets.

168
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,540
I see.

169
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,120
I should go now.

170
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,420
In fact,

171
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,240
I don't want you to participate
in your current state.

172
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
FUKUNAGA COMMERCIAL STREET

173
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,820
I have reached my peak, huh?

174
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,800
So that's the reason.

175
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,000
What do I do?

176
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,860
What do I do?

177
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,100
What do I do?

178
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,360
Diamond, I…

179
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,980
Done!

180
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,340
So this is what it's like.

181
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,660
-Woah.
-Open it.

182
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,820
Up. Further up.

183
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,840
Wait.

184
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,380
It's so big.

185
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,830
It's done.

186
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:11,980
"MAKE FRANCE FESTIVE, KITASAN BLACK!"
It's done.

187
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,560
"MAKE FRANCE FESTIVE, KITASAN BLACK!"
Yes.

188
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,830
"MAKE FRANCE FESTIVE, KITASAN BLACK!"
I wonder if Kita will like it.

189
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,880
Thank you everyone for your help.

190
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,060
Don't mention it.

191
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,520
It's a very beautiful victory banner.

192
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,840
Kita is going
to Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

193
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,740
It feels surreal.

194
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,700
You know,

195
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,760
while I believe Kita will put up
an impressive performance in France,

196
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,360
I still think

197
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,460
that Fuchu is where she belongs.

198
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,960
Yeah.

199
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,740
I want to be in the spectators' stand
and cheer for her in G1 during autumn.

200
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,400
We all want to see the moment
Kita defends her title in Tenno Sho.

201
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,300
I won't be able to see Kita for a while.

202
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,940
I'll miss her a lot.

203
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,360
I give her bananas
whenever she jogs past here.

204
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,860
And during the weekend, I watch
and cheer for her in the race.

205
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,580
She's part of our life now.

206
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,390
MAKE FRANCE FESTIVE, KITASAN BLACK!

207
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
TRAINER'S OFFICE

208
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,640
So that's your decision?

209
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,580
Yes.

210
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,980
Everyone wants to see the way I run.

211
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,620
They tell me

212
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,080
that I'm in their everyday life.

213
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,660
I'm not going to France anymore.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,960
If my time is running up,

215
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,180
I want to use whatever time I have
to perform before everyone.

216
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,360
Kitasan…

217
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,860
So sign me up for whatever races.

218
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,100
Be it Tenno Sho,
Japan Cup, or Arima Kinen,

219
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,580
I want to participate in them.

220
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,740
Then try to get
the veteran's triple crown.

221
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,580
Huh?

222
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,940
Only two horse girls have ever won

223
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,600
these three G1 races.

224
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,120
Besides, you may just win both spring
and autumn Tenno Sho.

225
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,900
What do you think?

226
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,240
Sure.

227
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,280
Let's start from
the Tenno Sho in autumn then.

228
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,020
Mr. Trainer, I want to win it

229
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,880
and prove to everyone
that I can still run.

230
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,700
Good.

231
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,400
All right then. I'll work very hard!

232
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,620
Yeah.

233
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,820
Sorry that I can't be there with you.

234
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,460
Yeah.

235
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,180
Yes.

236
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,840
Let's work hard together.

237
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,680
Bye.

238
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,950
KITASAN BLACK WITHDREW FROM
PRIX DE L'ARC DE TRIOMPHE

239
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,620
SATONO DIAMOND, 15TH
IN PRIX DE L'ARC DE TRIOMPHE

240
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,740
Due to the typhoon, the sky is cloudy.

241
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,260
The turf is affected by the downpour.

242
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,520
Despite the bad weather,

243
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,780
fans gather here in Tokyo Racecourse

244
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,540
to witness their performance.

245
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,360
We have a stellar lineup today.
Eight G1 horse girls in total.

246
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,240
And the highly-anticipated one is Kitasan
Black, who has five G1 wins.

247
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Indeed.

248
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,700
As long as she maintains her lead
as usual, we're in for a treat.

249
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,160
How will the winner of Takarazuka Kinen,
Satono Crown, fare?

250
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,360
She knows how to deal with wet turf.

251
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,880
I can't wait to see her performance today.

252
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,700
Tenno Sho will begin soon.

253
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,220
Tenno Sho.

254
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,320
A 2,000-meter lap under rain.

255
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,420
It begins now!

256
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,600
Eh? Kitasan Black…

257
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,120
She's off to a bad start and falls behind.

258
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,520
Everyone is vying for the lead
on the muddy path.

259
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,460
Did Kitasan Black miss the timing
because of the rain?

260
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,440
She fumbled her start.

261
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,580
In today's race, she'll have
to catch up from behind.

262
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,040
Kitasan is off to a bad start.

263
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,940
This is looking grim.

264
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,980
Heading to the first bend,

265
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,700
No. 11, Ivory Tower.

266
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,240
No. 1, Hard Control.

267
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,120
Kitasan Black is in this position.

268
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,700
Tenno Sho, the mid-range grand event
that combines classics

269
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,740
and veteran horse girls.

270
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,800
Huh? Why?

271
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,040
In this race, the distance between
the first and the second bend is 100m.

272
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,500
Staying in the inside line is advantageous

273
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,980
but don't forget that the track
is all muddy because of the typhoon.

274
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,540
Everyone will avoid the inside line.

275
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,360
Which means that they will spread out
at the bend and form a cluster.

276
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,620
Kitasan Black, who hit the gate
and got off to a bad start,

277
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,980
will have a hard time catching up.

278
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,120
This is a tough battle.

279
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,440
You sure have a pair of keen eyes.

280
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,480
Heading into the stretch,

281
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Ivory Tower is in the lead.

282
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,300
No. 18, Moon Hero, closes in
from the flank.

283
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,000
Satono Crown stays in the inside line.

284
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,180
They just completed a 1,000-meter lap.

285
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,540
Indeed, their performance is affected.
The completion time is 64 seconds.

286
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,000
Everyone is struggling.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This kind of track…

288
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,620
The Kitasan Black I know

289
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,960
does not care if the track
is in her favour or not.

290
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,300
Passing through the third bend,

291
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,040
Ivory Tower is in the lead.

292
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,560
No, Beyond Lightspeed overtook her.

293
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,100
Good.

294
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,260
Kitasan?

295
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,200
What's with that face of determination?

296
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,180
I won't lose to you.

297
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,820
Satono Crown closes in
and takes the second spot.

298
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,520
Which horse girl can conquer

299
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,140
this muddy track and obtain the trophy?

300
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,160
Heading to the last bend,
they only have 600 meters left.

301
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,720
Everyone is getting ready
for the final sprint.

302
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,540
They avoid the muddy inside line.

303
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,480
Beyond Lightspeed is still in the lead.

304
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,720
Perhaps everyone is exhausted
from running on a slippery track,

305
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,380
no one can overtake her.

306
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,180
Wait. Satono Crown speeds up.

307
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,500
She loves a muddy track
so she closes in decisively.

308
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,800
Good.

309
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,120
Satono Crown is about to secure the lead.

310
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,560
No. Right now,

311
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,360
Kitasan Black is here.

312
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Using her powerful limbs, she runs on the
muddy inside line that everyone avoids.

313
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,660
Kitasan Black closes the gap.

314
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,380
Crown!

315
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,980
Go!

316
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,580
Go, Kitasan!

317
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,440
Kitasan Black is relentless.

318
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,240
She has the lead now.

319
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,780
Victory is mine.

320
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,880
400 meters left.

321
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,700
Kitasan is in the lead.

322
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,160
Behind her is Satono Crown.

323
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,820
Can Kitasan Black outrun others

324
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,040
or will Satono Crown overtake her spot?

325
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,800
Kitasan.

326
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,480
That's my chance.

327
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,140
Can Kitasan maintain her lead?

328
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,100
Satono Crown went to the inside line.
Can she overtake Kitasan?

329
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,960
Crown is here.

330
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,040
The gap is diminishing.
Kitasan tries to secure her lead.

331
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,120
They make a beeline for fame and glory

332
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,900
on this muddy path in Tokyo Racecourse.

333
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,580
Everyone is caked with mud.

334
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,520
Who will hold the trophy
despite the storm?

335
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,120
Will it be Kitasan Black or Satono Crown?

336
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,880
You can do this, Crown.

337
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,720
Go!

338
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,180
But Kitasan still has the lead.

339
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,400
It's Kitasan Black!

340
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,300
Kitasan Black crosses the finishing line!

341
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,740
We were all misled by Kitasan's bad start.

342
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,900
What an amazing performance,
Kitasan Black!

343
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,420
She was off to a bad start

344
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,040
but it was no bother at all.

345
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,940
She claims the soaked track
with her speed and endurance,

346
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,060
as if she's telling everyone that she's
the strongest in the Twinkle Series.

347
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,800
She won beautifully.

348
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,420
She won Tenno Sho.

349
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,320
She won the spring
and the autumn Tenno Sho.

350
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,560
-Wow. Kitasan is simply too awesome.
-After Special Week and T M Opera O,

351
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,940
Kitasan Black is the third to obtain
this achievement.

352
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,460
Kitasan Black!

353
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,500
She completed the race in
2 minutes, 8.3 seconds.

354
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,940
She overcame
the less-than-ideal track condition

355
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,260
and did not give up the lead
to Satono Crown.

356
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,720
This is Kitasan Black's sixth G1 win.

357
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,760
I see it now…

358
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,460
I see it now…

359
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,340
I see it now…
