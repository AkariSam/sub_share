The promising Satono Diamond,
who has two G1 wins so far,

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,800
and the formidable Kitasan Black,
who herself has four G1 wins,

the top two horse girls

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,780
will face each other
this spring in Tenno Sho.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,460
As a reminder, Kitasan Black lost
to Satono Diamond in Arima Kinen.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,540
Will Kitasan have her revenge

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,740
or will Satono Diamond
snag another victory?

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,230

-Everything is ready. Let's go!

29
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,520
So Diamond, where should we go?

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,780
You don't have a place in mind?

31
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,380
I don't. Should we visit
the mountain or the beach?

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,220
I prefer the mountain.

33
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,420
But I prefer the beach.

34
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,980
Let's decide using rock, paper, scissors.

35
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,740
Sure.

36
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,920
Rock, paper, scissors!

37
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,420
The beach it is.

38
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,200
We're heading to the beach.

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,060
Let's go!

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,760
We haven't travelled together
for a while now.

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,780
I know, right?

42
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,670
A racecourse!

43
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,980
"HERE"
A racecourse!

44
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,360
Oh.

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Bye!

46
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,260
What are you doing?

47
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,460
I'm checking which beach we're going to.

48
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,740
You're not allowed to do that.

49
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,940
But it's more reassuring
if I know where I'm going.

50
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,340
We'll be fine.

51
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,280
I'm sure wherever we go, it'll be fun.

52
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,000
As long as we're travelling together,
everything will work out just fine.

54
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,600
All right.

55
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,320
If we don't know where to go,
we'll decide with rock, paper, scissors.

56
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Sure.

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,480

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,220

Mhm. It's so beautiful.

79
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,640
It's my first time seeing this.

80
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,320
Me too.

81
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,840
Diamond, thank you for coming with me.

82
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,240
No, I should thank you instead.

83
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,300
We haven't travelled together for
a while now and I had a lot of fun.

84
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,840
Yeah.

85
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,860
So?

86
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,180
You have something to tell me, don't you?

87
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,440
Yes.

88
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,100
I...

89
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,480
I want to make everyone smile.

90
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Many people support me.

91
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,460
Some care about me.

92
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,080
Some cheer loudly for me.

93
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,280
Some clap as loudly as they can for me.

94
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,700
Some are disappointed in me.

95
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,420
But some still entrust me
with their dreams.

96
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,940
Some might misunderstand me.

97
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,400
And some are first-time
visitors of the racecourse.

98
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,240
I want them to be fully invested
and immersed in the sports.

99
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,400
I want to bring a smile to their faces
with my performance.

100
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,680
Therefore,

101
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,940
I will not concede any more.

102
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,780
I will defeat you in Tenno Sho,

103
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,920
Satono Diamond.

104
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,460
I just want to relay my goal
to you personally.

105
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,200
I see.

106
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,820
I, too, cannot concede my goal.

107
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,420
I will win Tenno Sho.

108
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,820
Then, I will race internationally

109
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,140
and win Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe.

110
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,200
This is my dream.

111
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
So,

112
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,740
the winner can only be me.

113
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,560
Okay.

114
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,220

118
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,520
And this major event will leave a mark
in history books and in our memories.

119
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,140
In this race where there can only
be one winner,

120
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,620
Tenno Sho will begin soon.

121
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,620
The most highly anticipated match

122
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,820
is the one between Satono Diamond
and Kitasan Black.

123
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,500
Satono Diamond won Arima Kinen last year.

124
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,620
That's right.

125
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,820
Although they came fully prepared and
everyone can't wait to see the match,

126
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,340
they are far
from the only spotlight in this race.

127
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,500
Indeed.

128
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,900
They are not the only horse girls
who took the central stage.

129
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,940
We have the second runner-up of Japan Cup,
Cheval Grand.

130
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,180
She must have made a lot of progress
in the previous year.

131
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,460
I'm excited to see what she will
bring to the table today.

132
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,920
There's also Divinity,
who performed well in Satsuki Sho,

133
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,540
and Opheryu, who surprised everyone in G1.

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,960
Can Satono Diamond outrun these opponents?

135
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,880
She seems to be more confident
after she won Arima Kinen.

136
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,860
I think she's the best horse girl
here, bar none.

137
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,800
Satono Diamond expressed her wish
to join the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

138
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
Can she win this race
and reach greater heights?

139
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,520
But there's also Kitasan Black,
who's hungry for revenge.

140
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,320
Despite her loss in Arima Kinen,

141
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,180
her four G1 wins are more than enough
to prove her agility.

142
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,400
I hope she wins this time.

143
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,620
"MORAL SUPPORT"
You can do this, Kita.

144
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,480

Redeem yourself after Arima Kinen.

145
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,380
Another close match up in Tenno Sho.
It feels like a déjà vu.

146
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,440
Indeed. It's just like the match
between Mejiro McQueen and Tokai Teio.

147
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,160
The stage is ready.

148
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,580
The turf is in good condition. The race
to decide the strongest horse girl,

149
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,260
Tenno Sho, is about to begin.

150
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,420

McQueen is accelerating.

151
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,720
She keeps running.

152
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,440
She did it!

153
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,340
The first horse girl to defend her title,

154
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,980

The first horse girl to defend her title,

Mejiro McQueen!

Sakura Laurel is here.

157
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,020
Sakura Laurel is here.

158
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,920
Can she overtake here?

159
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,820
She can!

160
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,000
Sakura won again.

161
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,600
Sakura bloomed once more.

162
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,380
"SAKURA LAUREL, CHAMPION"
Sakura bloomed once more.

163
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,940
"SAKURA LAUREL, CHAMPION"
Sakura Laurel!

164
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,940
"SET SAIL FOR THE PATH OF GLORY"
Lady Charm is on the flank.

165
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,660
Lady Charm is on the flank.

166
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,180
Gold Ship is in the lead.

167
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,620
She passes the finishing line.

168
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,960
Lady Charm continued chasing till the end,

169
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,200
"GOLD SHIP, CHAMPION"
but Gold Ship won by a tiny margin.

170
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,150

171
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,700

172
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,580
With their eyes on the prize,

173
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,360
all horse girls are ready
in the horse gates.

174
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,240
It's now or never.

175
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,620
Start!

176
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,960
Everyone tries to secure the lead.

177
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,280
The one leading is Tudor Garden.

178
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,420
Off to a great start,
Kitasan takes the second place.

179
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,960
Great House in on the flank.

180
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,300
Moon Hero, Cheval Grand, and Single Lonely

181
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,260
are on the inside line.

182
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,300
The highly anticipated Satono Diamond
is behind the middle of the pack.

183
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,520
Will this be her third G1 win
after Arima Kinen?

184
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,880
Everyone is watching the race
with bated breath.

185
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,940
After the fourth bend,
they have arrived at the stretch.

186
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,320
Tudor Garden is miles ahead
of her opponents

187
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
while Kitasan Black
maintains her position.

188
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
The record for the first 1,000-meter lap

189
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,620
is 58.3 seconds.

190
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,540
She is way ahead of Kitasan,

191
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,500
but...

192
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,480
Mhm. Kitasan is unfazed
and maintains a consistent speed.

193
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,900
That's a defending champion for you.

194
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,920
Tudor Garden continues
to increase her lead.

195
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
She's now ahead by six to seven lengths.

196
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,740
Pay her no mind.

197
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,760
I am stronger than I was a year ago.

198
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,220
I can overtake her.

199
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,920
I just have to focus on my tempo.

200
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,420
Tudor Garden heads to the first bend.

201
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,760
Behind her is Kitasan Black, Great House,
Cheval Grand, and Moon Hero.

202
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,620
Satono Diamond is in position too.

203
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,120
The race hasn't ended yet.

204
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,760
Before the third bend, the Kyoto slope,

205
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,860
everything will change over there.

206
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,740
All horse girls passed the second bend
and arrived at another stretch.

207
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,220
Kitasan Black is in the second place.

208
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,780
Behind her is Great House
and Cheval Grand.

209
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,240
When will they accelerate?

210
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,640
Satono Diamond is waiting
for an opportunity in the middle too.

211
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,780
Tudor Garden is still in the lead.

212
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,080
Can she maintain it till the very end?

213
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,500
Now!

214
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,260
Tudor Garden seems
to have slowed down on the slope.

215
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,820
Satono Diamond seized this opportunity
and closed the gap.

216
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
The lead Tudor Garden has is disappearing.

217
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,480
Kitasan Black now takes the lead.

218
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,420
Satono Diamond also closes in.

219
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,680
Patient. Be patient.

220
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
The thunderous cheer from the fans
welcomes these 17 horse girls.

221
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,100
I will speed up in the final stretch,

222
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,780
like what I did in Arima Kinen.

223
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,880
Here we are at the final stretch.

224
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,340
Kitasan Black maintains her lead.

225
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,000
Ahead by two lengths, she makes
a beeline to the finishing line.

226
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,440
Let's do this!

227
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
I must win.

228
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,100
Everyone began sprinting
in the final stretch.

229
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,280
Kitasan Black still has her lead,

230
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,460
but Satono Diamond is quickly approaching.

231
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,540
Cheval Grand closes in too.

232
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,880
Go, Kita!

233
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,820
Keep it up!

234
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,200
I will defeat you here.

235
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,480
I will catch up

236
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,700
and overtake you.

237
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,600
What?

238
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,940
Another burst after
running for 3,000 meters?

239
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,820
Go!

240
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,520
Her bottomless endurance,
her unyielding spirit,

241
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,480
and the work she has put in so far...

242
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,360
All that gives her strength to accelerate.

243
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,900
Kitasan Black is in the lead.

244
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,420
She heads to the finish line
with her fiery aura.

245
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,200
But Satono Diamond is so close behind her.

246
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,620
I don't want to lose.

247
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,300
I must catch up.

248
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
It's not over yet.

249
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,740
Come on, Diamond.

250
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,820
Kita...

251
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,500
No one...
No one can catch up to her at all.

252
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,200
She's alone in her journey.
No one can match her speed.

253
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,280
What an overwhelming lead
from Kitasan Black!

254
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,400
She far surpasses all 16 horse girls.

255
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,100
Kitasan Black crosses the finish line!

256
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,660
Kitasan Black defended her title!

257
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,680
She outdid herself
and put up a spectacular performance.

258
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,760
The trophy cup will once again
be held in her hands.

259
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,200
Taking the second spot is Cheval Grand,
who performed a masterclass sprint.

260
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
Unfortunately, Satono Diamond
took the third spot.

261
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,080
In this legendary match,

262
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,280
Kitasan Black redeemed herself beautifully
after her loss in Arima Kinen.

263
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,740
-Well done.
-Yes! That's my student for you.

264
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,580
-Yay!
-Yes! That's my student for you.

265
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,920
They both did so well.

266
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,500
I know, right?

267
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,360
There's more.

268
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,020
She completed the race
in 3 minutes and 12.5 seconds.

269
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,760
She broke the record!

270
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,320
No one had been able to break the record
in the past decade.

271
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,220
But not today!

272
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,280
Kitasan Black, surrounded by the cheers
from her sea of fans,

273
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,860
won her fifth G1!

274
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,380
Her record-breaking performance

275
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,440
-Woohoo!
-will surely leave a legacy behind.

276
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,580
will surely leave a legacy behind.

277
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
Good grief, that girl...

278
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,860
What a thrilling match.

279
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,000
You are ranked better
than you were last year.

280
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,100
You truly have grown a lot.

281
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,260
I am so proud of you.

282
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,520
Everyone is smiling.

283
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,020
They are so happy.

284
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,120
You took the lead after the third bend.

285
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,120
Then, you accelerated on the stretch
and performed another burst of speed.

286
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,960
You were impeccable.

287
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,360
I lost completely, Kita.

288
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Congratulations on your win.

289
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,920
Diamond...

290
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,680
Thank you.

291
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,440
You're always ahead of me and you show me
what I have never seen before.

292
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,260
But...

293
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,080
We're even now.

294
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,660
But next time, I won't lose.

295
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,560
I will be stronger than I am now.

296
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,940
If we run together,

297
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,060
we can reach a bigger stage.

298
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,640
Diamond.

299
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,640
Let's bring joy
to everyone with our performance.

300
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,740
Let's make everyone
call out our name loudly

301
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,520
with our performance.

302
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,000
Just like what we do in a festival.

303
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,100
As long as you're with me,

304
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,940
we are invincible.

305
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,000
Kitasan...

306
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,960
Yes, together,

307
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,180
we can do anything.

308
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,980
-You're awesome!
-Kita...

309
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,040
-We can.
-Kita...

310
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,440
Kitasan...
