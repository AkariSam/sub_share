1
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:02,917
Moving into the fourth bend,

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:04,375
in the third place is Satono Diamond.

3
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,917
And in the fourth place is Celeste.

4
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:07,583
In the final stretch,

5
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,042
Ivory Tower defends her second place

6
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,083
in the inside line.

7
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,917
Satono Diamond rushes out from the side.

8
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:13,500
Go, Diamond!

9
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,542
Diamond picks up her speed.

10
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,875
200 meters left.

11
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,583
She leaves her opponents behind her

12
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,625
and charges forward.

13
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,083
Go!

14
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,042
The Satono family has finally
produced a winner!

15
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,167
Way to go!

16
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,625
Satono Diamond

17
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,583
won her debut race.

18
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,250
The last sprint was beautiful.

19
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,500
I can't wait
to see her future performance.

20
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,917
Looking back, this year has
many, many memorable moments.

21
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:49,000
Next week, the voting phase
of Arima Kinen will begin.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,125
Mr. Yamamoto,

23
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:53,000
who do you think we'll see this year?

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,292
The popular candidates are Bravo Day,
who won Tenno Sho,

25
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:59,000
and Kitasan Black, who won Kikuka Sho.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,833
However, Gold Ship,

27
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,250
who has performed
very well in three races,

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,333
and has six victories so far in G1,

29
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,208
is noteworthy too.

30
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,500
Speaking of Gold Ship,

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,250
I am reminded of her sudden burst
in Takarazuka Kinen.

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,292
That's right.

33
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:16,167
She frequently brings surprises
to the table in the race.

34
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,542
I can't wait to see her performance

35
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:20,125
in the fourth Arima Kinen.

36
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:46,958
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

37
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:52,500
So,

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,333
"EPISODE 3: DREAM NEVER DIES"
So,

39
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,167
"EPISODE 3: DREAM NEVER DIES"
let's celebrate Diamond's great debut

40
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:55,625
"EPISODE 3: DREAM NEVER DIES"
and her first victory.

41
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,125
and her first victory.

42
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,500
Cheers!

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,833
Cheers!

44
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,917
"SATONO CROWN, CHEVAL GRAND"
We have done this many times already.

45
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,417
"SATONO CROWN, CHEVAL GRAND"
Why am I here?

46
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:07,500
There can never be enough toasts.

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's invite today's star, Diamond,
to say something.

48
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,667
I managed to make
a successful debut today.

49
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,083
Thank you everyone for your support.

50
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,792
Then,

51
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,250
what is your dream?

52
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,125
Dream?

53
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,125
Yes.

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,958
I'm aiming for next year's
Classic Triple Crown.

55
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,375
First, it'll be Satsuki Sho.

56
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,333
I will achieve my family's dream.

57
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,500
Let's work hard together, Diamond.

58
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,375
For our family.

59
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,625
Now,

60
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,000
let's ask Cheval the same question.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,792
Me?

62
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:48,833
Yes.

63
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,167
It's a shame that I couldn't take part

64
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,292
in the races this spring due to my injury.

65
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,583
But I'll do it next year.

66
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,208
I will win G1.

67
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,125
What about your dream?

68
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:03,958
My dream?

69
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,208
Speak now.

70
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,500
Uhm...

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,250
Arima Kinen.

72
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,958
I want to take part in Arima Kinen.

73
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,292
Arima Kinen...

74
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,000
But you're already in it.

75
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,875
Mhm. You won Kikuka Sho.

76
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,125
Oh?

77
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,667
Can I run in the race?

78
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,292
Is it a yes?

79
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,208
Yes.

80
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,750
Diamond.

81
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:30,750
All right.

82
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,375
For us and our future.

83
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,708
Cheers!

84
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,958
Again?

85
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,000
Yay!

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,458
So I can run, right?

87
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,708
Arima Kinen?

88
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,292
I'm not sure yet,

89
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,875
but judging from the date

90
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,375
and your performance in Kikuka Sho,
I'd say yes.

91
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,792
Hooray!

92
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,792
You have been racing against your peers.

93
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,500
But in Arima Kinen,

94
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,792
you will be pinned against the veterans.

95
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:55,875
Are you ready?

96
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,792
Yes!

97
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,708
Congratulations, Kita.

98
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,542
Nice one.

99
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,000
Well done.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,833
You can do this, Kita.

101
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,958
Teio...

102
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,583
Guys...

103
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,458
I will do my best.

104
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,292
What's going on?

105
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,292
This is way over the top.

106
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:15,667
Yeah.

107
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,250
What are you doing?

108
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,458
I had difficulties
exiting the starting gate.

109
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,208
Please.

110
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't want a repeat
of what happened in Takarazuka Kinen.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,167
It was a great mistake.

112
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,750
It was.

113
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,000
We finally passed the re-inspection
of the starting gate.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,625
If we screw things up in Japan Cup...

115
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,167
Don't worry.

116
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,833
I will get off to a perfect start

117
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,542
and win my seventh victory.

118
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,917
Then, I'll join Arima Kinen

119
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,667
and be the first horse girl
to have eight victories in G1.

120
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,292
Stop making grand promises

121
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,500
and start your training then!

122
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,375
Geez.

123
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,708
She sure is very determined.

124
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,708
I have high expectations of you, Kitasan.

125
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,375
I am very determined too!

126
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:57,750
Arima...

127
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,208
Arima is my goal.

128
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,250
All right.

129
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,250
I will not lose to anyone.

130
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,750
"JOIN SPICA OR BE BURIED"
I will not lose to anyone.

131
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,583
I have heard your Kikuka Concerto.

132
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,333
Your melody.

133
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,000
Nice to meet you,
the most elegant Miss Kitasan Black.

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,167
I am Sounds of Earth.

135
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,375
"SOUNDS OF EARTH"
I am Sounds of Earth.

136
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,417
Right.

137
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,958
Race is but a symphony
between the Earth and the horse girls.

138
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,333
All horse girls are magnificent musicians.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,208
Come.

140
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,083
Duet with me.

141
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,917
Too close. Too close!

142
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,083
Together, we can play

143
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,458
the most exquisite tune in Arima.

144
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,583
You're too close to me!

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,583
Earth!

146
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,542
What are you doing?

147
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,667
Nature.

148
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,500
Oh. A harmony is about to begin.

149
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,167
I can't wait, Kitasan Black.

150
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,792
We will unite in the orchestra
of Arima Kinen.

151
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,750
Sheesh.

152
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,125
Sorry, Kita.

153
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,625
I hope the new student
didn't frighten you.

154
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,875
New student?

155
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,792
Earth is part of the Canopus?

156
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,125
She's eccentric.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,500
But at the same time,

158
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
she is also very fast.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Maybe she will win in Arima Kinen.

160
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,792
It'll be Canopus's first G1!

161
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,542
Will you take part in Arima Kinen?

162
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,083
Yes!

163
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,833
Nothing is set in stone now,

164
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,333
but the trainer said that I should
be able to attend it.

165
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,625
You are excited.

166
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,083
Yes! Because I dream of competing in it.

167
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,417
Arima Kinen

168
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,417
has a special meaning to me.

169
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,458
Arima Kinen, huh?

170
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,833
Nature, you've participated in it
before, haven't you?

171
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,875
Yes, though I got third place
three years in a row.

172
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,875
But yes, Arima Kinen is special to me too.

173
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,333
That's right.

174
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,125
Thank you, Nature.

175
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,000
Why so sudden?

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,167
I can participate in Arima Kinen

177
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,000
because I won Kikuka Sho.

178
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:04,208
But it's thanks to your encouragement
that I won.

179
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,750
You won the race yourself.

180
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't do anything.

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,208
But...

182
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,125
Don't fuss about the details.

183
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,542
Just train for Arima Kinen now.

184
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,500
If you need a listener, I'll be there.

185
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,958
Thank you so much,

186
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,208
Miss Nature.

187
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,333
Miss Nature...

188
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,292
How did I do?

189
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,792
It was perfect, wasn't it?

190
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,958
Yes. It's good.

191
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,208
Great!

192
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,167
Japan Cup will be mine now.

193
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:41,375
Don't get ahead of yourself now.

194
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,792
Thank you, McQueen.

195
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:48,958
Last lap!

196
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,625
You can do it, Kita!

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,375
You broke today's record
in your final lap.

198
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,917
Yay!

199
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,333
Drink up.

200
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,792
Thank you.

201
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,500
Are you done with your training now?

202
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Yes.

203
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,417
But I'm going for another lap.

204
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,917
Kita, your bottle!

205
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,208
She's still training?

206
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
She's on her growth spurt now.

207
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:28,750
The year will come to an end in a month.

208
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,000
Have you picked up your Christmas present?

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,250
Done.

210
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you, Kita.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,917
Don't mention it.

212
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,125
By the way, I voted for you

213
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,083
in Arima Kinen.

214
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,583
Did you?

215
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,042
Me too.

216
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,000
Here. Take this.

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,083
I will cheer for you. Good luck.

218
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,333
Thank you!

219
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,333
FIERCE RACE IN JAPAN CUP

220
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,375
OVERTAKE FAILED, GOLD SHIP RANKED 10TH

221
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,125
Kita, wakey-wakey.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,083
I don't want to leave my bed.

223
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:24,417
Today's breakfast is your favourite,
carrot rice and banana steak.

224
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,542
I'll eat a boatload of them

225
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,333
and train hard!

226
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,333
Eh?

227
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,667
GOLD SHIP PRESS CONFERENCE

228
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,667
Gold?

229
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,208
Thank you for coming here.

230
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,417
I am holding this press conference

231
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:46,375
to make an announcement.

232
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,542
Announcement?

233
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,875
I, Gold Ship,

234
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,958
will compete in Dream Trophy

235
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,250
after Arima Kinen.

236
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,208
If you switch to Dream Trophy,

237
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,750
you forfeit your qualification
in the Twinkle Series.

238
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,958
Yes.

239
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,417
Arima Kinen will be

240
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,167
my last run

241
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,333
in the Twinkle Series.

242
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:19,000
"UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3"
Last run?

243
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,042
Gold.

244
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,083
Do you

245
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,375
mean what you said?

246
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,917
About the last run?

247
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,333
Yes.

248
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,833
First, it was Satsuki Sho.
Then, it was Kikuka Sho.

249
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,333
When I first raced in Arima Kinen,

250
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,083
I could overtake everyone.

251
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,833
I went from the last place

252
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,417
to the first place.

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,750
That's how I race.

254
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,333
Somehow,

255
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,875
things changed.

256
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,125
I cannot control my emotions anymore.

257
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,083
You've always been like that.

258
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,625
-Watch out!
-The starting gate becomes an issue.

259
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,583
I begin to lose focus.

260
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,042
Which tile should I play?

261
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,375
You've always been like that...

262
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,292
Huh?

263
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,792
So yeah, I'm serious about my decision.

264
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:21,792
Is that why

265
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,667
you made that decision?

266
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,917
Don't sulk.

267
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,292
My dream does not end here.

268
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,458
I lost to Orfevre in the year
before last year.

269
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,250
Last year, I lost to Gentildonna.

270
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,625
I will win this year's Arima Kinen
and get seven wins in G1.

271
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,708
That is the perfect ending for me.

272
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,250
Gold...

273
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,542
Are you crying
because it'll be my last match?

274
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,708
No, because...

275
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,042
Because I have to win

276
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:54,125
in your last match and you won't
have your perfect ending.

277
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,333
You little...

278
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,958
You think you'll win?

279
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,208
Brace yourself for a rude
awakening, rookie.

280
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,750
Don't go easy on me in my last race,

281
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,500
you genius.

282
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,750
You too, Gold.

283
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,042
You will leave the gate safely, all right?

284
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,500
Is that provocation I hear?

285
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,708
To Diamond's second victory.

286
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,375
Cheers!

287
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,375
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
SECOND VICTORY, DIAMOND

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,583
I hope my victory today
will make you run faster tomorrow, Kita.

289
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,542
Yes, yes.

290
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,125
I am feeling very confident
and motivated now.

291
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,125
"ARIMA KINEN, NAKAYAMA RACECOURSE"
Here we are.

292
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,875
We have arrived at Arima Kinen!

293
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,458
Kita?

294
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,958
I wonder what it's like

295
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,542
to run your last race.

296
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,083
I don't know.

297
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,917
But we shouldn't dwell on it.

298
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:05,167
We can only focus on our current race.

299
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,250
Diamond...

300
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,042
Don't you want
to give Gold a proper farewell?

301
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,292
Do your best tomorrow.

302
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,875
I will win the race.

303
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,458
Despite the harsh winter,

304
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,417
120,000 passionate fans have gathered
at the Nakayama Racecourse.

305
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:26,833
The cold failed to extinguish
the flame in their hearts.

306
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,250
The race will begin soon.

307
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,000
The end of G1, Arima Kinen.

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,333
Let's welcome our commentator,
Mr. Yamamoto.

309
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,583
We do have a star-studded lineup,
don't we?

310
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,750
Yes, we do.

311
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,250
We have Bravo Day, two wins in G1,
voted second place by the fans.

312
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,083
We have the champion of Kikuka Sho,
Kitasan Black.

313
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,125
We have the very promising candidate
from this autumn, Sounds of Earth.

314
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,333
River Light and her rival sister, Parol.

315
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,667
And of course, the fan-voted first place,

316
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,708
also her last race in the Twinkle Series,
Gold Ship.

317
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,708
Good luck, Gold Ship!

318
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,333
Go, Earth!

319
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,292
You can do this, Earth!

320
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,542
The weather is cold
but the atmosphere here is warm.

321
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,667
I'm so nervous but also excited.

322
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,167
This must be Arima Kinen.

323
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,542
I am now

324
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,375
on the stage called Arima Kinen.

325
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:26,458
G1, ARIMA KINEN
NAKAYAMA, 2,500M COURSE

326
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,500
All horse girls
are in the starting stalls.

327
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,250
The last grand prix of this year,

328
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,500
Arima Kinen.

329
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,542
Everyone is off to a good start.

330
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,125
Good!

331
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,917
Everyone is fighting
for the first spot now.

332
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,500
Kitasan Black is in the lead.

333
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,125
Opheryu is on the inside line.

334
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,875
Sounds of Earth is following
closely behind.

335
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,833
As usual, Gold Ship occupies
the last spot.

336
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,833
All 16 horses are heading
to the first straight.

337
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,792
Go, Earth!

338
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,500
Win this G1!

339
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,958
Do we cheer for Gold Ship or Kitasan?

340
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,083
Both!

341
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,083
All the best, Kita.

342
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,500
-Gold Ship...
-Gold Ship's last race, eh?

343
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,875
Arima Kinen,

344
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,583
the birthplace of many memorable moments.

345
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,083
Symboli Rudolf was here.

346
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,333
The legend, Manhattan Cafe, was here.

347
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:38,792
Who are you?

348
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,083
Not to mention Oguri Cap, who made

349
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,083
her final comeback in her last match
of the Twinkle Series.

350
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,000
Who are you again?

351
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,667
This is exciting.

352
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:49,458
Gold Ship has the same colour.
Will she make a similar comeback?

353
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,125
Do you want some?

354
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,542
Kitasan Black maintains her lead.

355
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,042
They passed the first bend
amidst the loud cheer.

356
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,708
Behind her was No. 12, Parol.

357
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,542
No. 7, Opheryu is on the inside line.

358
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:02,292
No. 9, Sounds of Earth is on the outside.

359
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,208
Then, No. 4, Bravo Day.

360
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,750
No. 5, Great House.

361
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,958
Behind them is No. 2 Brave Target.

362
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,542
I can feel the pressure from the veterans.

363
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:13,333
They are now on the second bend
and the straight.

364
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,583
All horses are in a single file now.

365
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,458
No. 11, Kitasan Black, still has the lead.

366
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,833
Then, it's No. 12, Parol.

367
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,667
What?

368
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,000
-Here she goes!
-A white shadow.

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,167
Gold Ship is on the move!

370
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,083
She overtakes everyone.

371
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,583
She overtakes one after another.

372
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,625
-Is this it?
-Is Gold Ship doing it?

373
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,500
This long sprint...

374
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,333
River Light
is heading to the fourth bend.

375
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,667
Sounds of Earth is following behind.

376
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:46,917
Opheryu closes the gap too.

377
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,292
-Go, Earth!
-Opheryu closes the gap too.

378
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,958
The final stretch.

379
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,583
Kitasan Black is in the lead.

380
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,875
Kitasan Black!

381
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,375
Kita, go!

382
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,417
200 meters left. Keep up.

383
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,542
You can do this!

384
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,042
Kitasan Black is accelerating.

385
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,000
River Light catches up to her.

386
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,125
But Gold Ship is coming.

387
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,042
Gold Ship is approaching.

388
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:12,875
Gold Ship is back.

389
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,500
Show us how you overtake everyone again!

390
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,208
Go, Gold Ship!

391
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,875
You can do this!

392
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,833
Run with everything you have.

393
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,500
The unsinkable ship, Gold Ship.

394
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,667
In her final race,

395
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,917
will she sail

396
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:28,708
to victory?

397
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,250
She can't!

398
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,583
She can't close the gap.

399
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,333
Kitasan Black takes the lead.

400
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,250
Then, River Light.

401
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,292
Then, No. 7, Opheryu.

402
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:51,583
Kitasan Black does not concede.

403
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,708
So close. So close.

404
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,292
Opheryu is here.

405
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,458
Opheryu!

406
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,000
Sounds of Earth is here too.

407
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Opheryu secures the first spot

408
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,500
and crosses the finishing line!

409
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,833
Opheryu won!

410
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,250
Yay!

411
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,667
Sounds of Earth is in the second place.

412
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,208
Such a mesmerizing concerto!

413
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,583
Good job!

414
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,500
The champion of Kikuka Sho,
Kitasan Black, is in third place.

415
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,292
The top fan-voted athlete, Gold Ship,

416
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,750
finishes her last race
in the eighth place.

417
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,667
What happened?

418
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,708
Shouldn't you win in my last race?

419
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,542
Gold...

420
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,417
Gold...

421
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,958
Gold.

422
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,083
I told you not to cry.

423
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,292
You did very well.

424
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,500
Good job.

425
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,250
Thank you for this thrilling last race.

426
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,583
Six victories in G1!

427
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,083
That's impressive, Gold Ship.

428
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,708
It doesn't end here.

429
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,750
Wait for me, Orfevre, Gentildonna.

430
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,292
The loss I have in your hands
in the Twinkle Series

431
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:33,125
will be redeemed in Dream Trophy.

432
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,375
My dream doesn't end here.

433
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,583
I will show everyone.

434
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,292
You will face them again?

435
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,875
The ship will continue to sail.

436
00:20:45,750 --> 00:21:01,417
Gold Ship!

437
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,750
-Wow.
-Gold Ship!

438
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,417
-The 8th place outshines the 1st place.
-Gold Ship!

439
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:06,292
-Indeed.
-Gold Ship!

440
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,292
-That's a very Gold Ship thing to do.
-Gold Ship!

441
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:16,292
Gold Ship!

442
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,208
To my first Arima Kinen.

443
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,542
Cheers!

444
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:23,542
NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER

445
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,667
You were so close, Kita.

446
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,875
Getting third place in Arima Kinen
is an achievement.

447
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,875
Yes, you did very well.

448
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,417
Thank you.

449
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,833
But...

450
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,833
I was hoping

451
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,083
to win the race.

452
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,375
Kita...

453
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,333
Gold?

454
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,458
Here.

455
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,833
One side left for you.

456
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,500
I have six sides to solve.

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,833
Can you solve it?

458
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,375
Is she...

459
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:10,167
I will surpass you, Gold.

460
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,500
I'll solve all six sides

461
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,917
and do better.

462
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,125
My dream has just begun.

463
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,333
In the upcoming year, I will...

464
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,375
I must...

465
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,042
All right.

466
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,333
To my future.

467
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,542
Cheers!

468
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:25,958
Again?
