1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,230
SATONO GROUP PRE-G1 CONFERENCE

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,240
It's autumn now. G1 is upon us.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,580
Yes. I will win Kikuka Sho.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,120
We will pray for you.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,460
All the best.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,560
Thank you. I will win G1 for my family.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,500
What a devoted child.
Don't let me down now.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,460
See you.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,440
-I can't wait.
-Me too.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,220
As usual, our uncles hold you
in high regard.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,520
Are you ready for Kikuka Sho?

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,240
Yes, I am. Crown, are you
competing abroad again?

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,320
Before that, I have to participate
in Tenno Sho this autumn.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,480
Let's do our best together.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,420
Yes.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,060
Crown lost in Satsuki Sho
due to overleaning

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,340
and Diamond lost in Satsuki
for the same reason too.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,080
In Derby, she lost because her
horseshoes fell off.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,120
Who knows what mishap will show up
in Kikuka Sho this time?

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,020
Even the promising Diamond lost.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,080
Is this the Satono curse?

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,720
I guess no horse girls
from the Satono family can win G1.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,800
Crown.

24
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:06,140
But…

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,780
Prove them wrong with results.

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
EPISODE 6: DIAMOND

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,280
Diamond is very motivated.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,800
She is fully prepared.

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,460
I'm sure she will ace
the 3,000-meter-long sprint

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,020
in the Kyoto Racecourse this Kikuka Sho.

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,400
It's the final race
of the triple crown classic races.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,020
She's got it this time.

33
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,380
That's right.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,380
Satsuki Sho. Derby.

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,700
I was physically and mentally
prepared for them.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought I could win the race

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,240
and break the curse.

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,140
However…

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,240
Divinity appeared from the flank!

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
She left everyone behind.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
No. 8, Satono Diamond, follows
closely behind

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,340
but is unable to overtake her.

43
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,340
If neither speed nor strength
can dispel this curse,

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,280
I shall…

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,200
I'll dig in now.

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
And now, today's horoscope.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,450
Let's check out
the 11th and the 12th place.

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,530
"HOROSCOPE"
Taking the 11th place is Aquarius.

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,200
"11TH AQUARIUS"
Taking the 11th place is Aquarius.

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,440
Taking the 11th place is Aquarius.

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,683
Today is not your day.

52
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,093
"11TH AQUARIUS"
Today is not

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,460
"TODAY IS NOT YOUR DAY"
your day

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,080
"UNLUCKY COLOUR: RED"
and stay away from red items.

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,940
Red items…

56
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,330
SHICHIMI SPICE

57
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,840
That's a lot of shichimi in your miso
soup. You probably can't drink it anymore…

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,520
Diamond, are you all right?

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,380
Yes, I'm fine.

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,900
Sorry, Kita. I have to go now.

61
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,540
Okay.

62
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
What got into Diamond today?

63
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,340
And the last place is Pisces.

64
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,580
That's me!

65
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,210
FORTUNE TELLER

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,260
Fukukita, please read my fortune.

67
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,820
Woo.

68
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,000
Let me see.

69
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,640
I see omens.

70
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,220
Do not head east. It's bad.

71
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,460
Misfortune surrounds you.

72
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,520
East, is it?

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,660
Yes. Never go east. It's bad. Very bad.

74
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,020
There must be a solution, Fuku.

75
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,160
Something to ward off the bad luck?

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,220
Let me see.

77
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,920
I see hope in the west.

78
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,140
No need for that.

79
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,980
Thank you so much.

80
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Don't you want to get rid
of your bad luck?

81
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,220
Diamond was not herself this morning.

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,940
Diamond?

83
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,240
East should be this side.

84
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,200
Diamond?

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,820
Just a small setback…

86
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,960
I just overcame the bad luck
Fukukita foretold.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,900
Next!

88
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,640
Fortune-telling, huh?

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,740
"COPANO RICKEY"
You want to summon bad luck?

90
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,660
Yes. What should I do?

91
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,860
To avoid misfortune, you can rely
on feng shui.

92
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,160
You can count on me.

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,740
Let me check.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,540
Hmm…

95
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,920
Apparently, you should avoid woody areas.

96
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,960
They will bring misfortune to you.

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
Woody areas, you say?

98
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Thank you.

99
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,400
Be careful.

100
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,980
And good luck!

101
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,100
Feng shui?

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,780
Woody areas. I guess it's around here.

103
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,280
Let's train hard today.

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,680
Bakushin. Bakushin. Bakushin.

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,340
Bakushin. Bakushin.

106
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,020
Bakushin-shin!

107
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,460
Bakushin. Bakushin. Bakushin.

108
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,080
Bakushin. Bakushin.

109
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,620
Bakushin-shin!

110
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,460
Bakushin O!

111
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,180
Good. I overcame the bad luck
Rickey foretold.

112
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,170
Next!

113
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,170
LIBRARY

114
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,460
Let's see…

115
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,380
"7 URBAN LEGENDS OF TRACEN ACADEMY"
At 4:44PM,

116
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,400
"7 URBAN LEGENDS OF TRACEN ACADEMY"
play the piano in the music room

117
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,350
"7 URBAN LEGENDS OF TRACEN ACADEMY"
and the feet monster will appear.

118
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,038
"7 URBAN LEGENDS OF TRACEN ACADEMY"
and the feet monster will appear.

119
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:32,725
"001"
and the feet monster will appear.

120
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:33,413
"At 4:44PM, PLAY THE PIANO IN THE MUSIC ROOM"
and the feet monster will appear.

121
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:34,100
"AND THE FEET MONSTER WILL APPEAR"
and the feet monster will appear.

122
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,460
All right then.

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,640
Where did Diamond go?

124
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,240
4:43PM

125
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,990
4:44PM

126
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,755
DO NOT PLAY THE PIANO

127
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:06,675
"DO NOT PLAY THE PIANO"
But the feet monster did not appear.

128
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:07,445
"DO NOT PLAY THE PIANO"
I guess this is done.

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,600
Ack! It's the feet monster!

130
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,700
What got into Diamond today?

131
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,780
I'm back.

132
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,180
Welcome back, Kita.

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,100
Diamond, what's with the animals?

134
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,720
They are here for my special training.

135
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Special training?

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,300
Ravens and black cats are bad omens.

137
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,060
I brought them here to break my curse.

138
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,640
My collection of lanterns!

139
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,326
A special training to dispel curses?

140
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,660
Yes. It's what I'm doing.

141
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,860
My family curse is very real

142
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,540
and it cannot be dispelled
by my strength alone.

143
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,060
Therefore, I'll undergo a special training

144
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,780
so that I will not be fazed
when something happens in Kikuka Sho.

145
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,100
So that's why you brought
a black cat and a raven here.

146
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,900
Just… don't push yourself too far.

147
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,560
I'll be fine. You should stop
worrying about me, Kita.

148
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
I'll go out for a jog now.

149
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,980
This late?

150
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,440
Yes. I didn't get enough
training this morning.

151
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm off.

152
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,220
Take care.

THOSE WHO STAY AT SCHOOL PAST MIDNIGHT

157
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,990

158
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,870
11:59PM

159
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,000
12AM

160
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,190
WHAT IS KIKUKA SHO?

161
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,440
KIKUKA SHO

162
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,180
I will overcome every obstacle.

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,920
I will win G1 for my family.

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,960
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

165
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,580
My family…

166
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,620
We often hold social or charity events

167
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,440
to promote horse girl racing.

168
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,560
That said,

169
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,300
the best way to contribute

170
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,960
is to present a horse girl who wins G1.
But that hasn't happened.

171
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,960
"SPORTS DAY"
I am lucky enough to be gifted

172
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,580
with a pair of strong legs.

173
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,880
People came to watch me run,

174
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,100
and they cheered when I got first place.

175
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,380
It made me proud too.

176
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,080
Naturally, going professional
became my dream.

177
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,140
And like my sisters, I want

178
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,420
to win G1 for my family.

179
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,420
However…

180
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,870
ATHLETES LOUNGE

181
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,380
I did my best…

182
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,980
But G1 is beyond my reach.

183
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,840
Sorry, Diamond.

184
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,360
You'll have to carry all our dreams
on your shoulders.

185
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,240
Whenever I pick up the broken dreams
of my retired sisters,

186
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,580
I vow

187
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,780
to win for them too.

188
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,620
I will bring a ray of hope
to my family.

189
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,200
But…

190
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,680
So even Diamond can't win in G1.

191
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,240
She's so promising

192
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
but she can never get first place.

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,480
The Satono curse is real.

194
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,160
We can never win G1 no matter
how hard we try.

195
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,900
What's the point of debuting then?

196
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,360
I have to win.

197
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,320
I need to restore everyone's faith.

198
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,180
I must…

199
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,716
A special training to dispel curses?

200
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,480
She keeps increasing her training hours.

201
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,060
No matter what concerns I raise,
she'll just tell me that she's fine.

202
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,460
But is she truly fine?

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
Is now the time to worry about others?

204
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,040
She's strong. She'll be fine.

205
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,760
But…

206
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
It's normal to be worried for your friend.

207
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,220
Unlike you, Kitasan cares a lot
about her friends.

208
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,440
What? I care the most about my friends.

209
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,040
-I symbolize friendship.
-Find a way to get rid of her bad luck.

210
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,340
-She needs some nutritious drinks.
-Find a way to get rid of her bad luck.

211
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,880
-That's right.
-Something to remove her bad luck…

212
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,760
Will a charm do?

213
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,110
Nutritious drinks!

214
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,800
One more lap.

215
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,460
You are very motivated.

216
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,320
Mc… McQueen?

217
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,540
Why are you here?

218
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,700
Can we talk?

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,600
How are you feeling?

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,020
Very good.

221
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,240
I have to win the final race

222
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,580
of the triple crown classic races.

223
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,560
Kitasan is worried about you.

224
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,700
Me too.

225
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,020
Oh… As usual, she worries
about others too much.

226
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,360
Is that so?

227
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,580
You are at your limit, aren't you?

228
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,260
"Satono horse girls can't win G1."

229
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,020
Have you heard of this curse?

230
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,620
Yes.

231
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,700
It's just a superstition.

232
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,040
Only fools will believe that.

233
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,140
That was what I had been telling myself.

234
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,860
However,

235
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,300
I can't keep losing.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,140
I must dispel the curse in Kikuka Sho…

237
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,180
Curses are invented by those
who benefited from hindsight.

238
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,620
That's not true.

239
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,540
When I was in Satsuki Sho or Derby, I…

240
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
Have you heard of another saying then?

241
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,880
"Only the strongest horse girl
can win Kikuka Sho."

242
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,420
Yes, I have heard of that.

243
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,560
If those legends or myths are true,

244
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,080
it means that a certain special power
allows Kitasan and I to win in Kikuka Sho.

245
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,000
It's thanks to this preternatural gift
that we won.

246
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
That's not true. You and Kita won
because you two are very strong.

247
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,220
There are no special forces in play or…

248
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,420
See? Curses are invented by those

249
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,600
who benefited from hindsight.

250
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,100
In spring, you had an unlucky streak.

251
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,580
But underperforming or horseshoe falling
off are normal occurrences in a race.

252
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,160
Normal occurrences, huh?

253
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,220
Yes.

254
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,760
It's like when people say that only
the strongest horse girl wins.

255
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,600
"She'll win anyway.
She makes the race dull".

256
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,960
Will hearing this from the horse girl
who received comments like this

257
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,800
convince you?

258
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,160
But the curse…

259
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,800
I know what you're going through.

260
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,400
You're racing for your family.

261
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,240
You carry the expectations of your family
with you.

262
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,680
It must be soul-crushing.

263
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,900
But you didn't run away.

264
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,640
You forge on and do your best
even though it's exhausting.

265
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,600
Not everyone can do that.

266
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,300
You got third place in Satsuki Sho
even though something got in your way.

267
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,060
You got second place in Japanese Derby
even though your horseshoe fell off.

268
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,840
In my eyes, you are more resilient
than anyone else.

269
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,600
The hard work you put in,

270
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,660
the resolution you manifested,

271
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,900
they cannot and will not be invalidated
by a curse people invented.

272
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,980
McQueen…

273
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,480
So please, have faith in yourself.

274
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,820
You are a very promising horse girl.

275
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,780
Rest well

276
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,140
and be in tip top shape before the race.

277
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,640
That's all.

278
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,940
Do you get it now?

279
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,640
If not, let me give you some advice.

280
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,440
A hare and a tortoise…

281
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,060
Can I ask for a favour?

282
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,240
Yes?

283
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,760
Please be there in Kikuka Sho.

284
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,080
I'll be the first
to cross the finish line.

285
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,580
Okay. I can't wait to see that.

286
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,740
Thank you.

287
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,460
I'm back…

288
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,180
You're back, Diamond.

289
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,500
Kita…

290
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,400
What are those things for?

291
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,500
To dispel the curse for you,
I bought many lucky charms.

292
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
Take this.

293
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,920
Thank you.

294
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,700
Sorry for making you worry.

295
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,080
I'm fine right now.

296
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,640
Thank goodness.

297
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Here. To celebrate the return
of the Diamond I know!

298
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,080
We have many spectators today
at the Kyoto Racecourse this autumn.

299
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
This is the final race
of the triple crown classic races.

300
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,680
Which horse girl will be crowned today?

301
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,660
A track of 3,000 meters long.

302
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,720
18 horse girls.

303
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,440
Athletes, please get in position.

304
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,600
Have faith in myself,

305
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,400
the Diamond who runs with the hopes

306
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,160
and the expectations of her family.

307
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,940
The last horse girl, No. 18,
Royal Flannel, is in the horse gate.

308
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,860
I am stronger than anyone.

309
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,100
Kikuka Sho

310
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,320
begins now!

311
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,020
No. 17, Tip Of The Tongue, is off
to a bad start.

312
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,740
-Go!
-No. 2, Jakarta Funk, is in the lead.

313
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,760
No. 5, Cabin Pilot, overtook her.

314
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,000
They are running as fast as they can.

315
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,960
The highly-anticipated Satono Diamond
is behind them five to six horse lengths.

316
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,540
They say only the strongest horse girl
can win in the final race

317
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,720
of the triple crown classic races.

318
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,060
Do you know why?

319
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,940
It's because…

320
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,540
You already explained it.

321
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,480
The horse girls are heading
to the first stretch now.

322
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,860
Go!

323
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,100
59.9 seconds for the first lap.

324
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,180
After receiving applause from the
spectators, they head into the first bend.

325
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,500
All horse girls shuffled into a line.

326
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,800
A line of 20 horse lengths

327
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,760
-Go!
-ushers into the first bend.

328
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,700
Diamond.

329
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,660
Bring hope to the horse girls
in our family.

330
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,320
You can do this, Diamond.

331
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,220
800 meters left.
We're now at the third bend.

332
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,800
No. 5, Cabin Pilot, is still in the lead.

333
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,800
I carry

334
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,500
the regret, the wishes, and the faith

335
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,720
of my family.

336
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,640
I will bring them

337
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,440
the light of glory

338
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,900
and the ray of hope.

339
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,060
I will realize my dream

340
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,420
and my family's goal.

341
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,180
I will be stronger and faster

342
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,200
than anyone!

343
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,000
Diamond!

344
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,840
No. 3, Satono Diamond speeds up.

345
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,860
No. 6, Divinity, also picks up her pace.

346
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,240
Both of them head to the final stretch.

347
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,360
No. 5, Cabin Pilot, is still
two horse lengths ahead.

348
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,540
Go!

349
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,520
We're at the final stretch.
Everyone is giving their all.

350
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,040
They now arrive at the spectator rows,
where crowds are cheering loudly for them.

351
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,080
Go!

352
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
Go!

353
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,260
Go!

354
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,220
No. 3, Satono Diamond, is on the flank.

355
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,740
Two horse lengths behind her
is No. 6, Divinity.

356
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,600
Behind them, Original Light

357
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,620
-Diamond.
-accelerates too.

358
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,960
She's here!

359
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,300
No. 3, Satono Diamond, overtakes everyone.

360
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,580
No. 13, Jewel Spinel,
