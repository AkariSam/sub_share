1
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:05,000
Horse girls,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,208
girls who were born to race.

3
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,333
Some had a rocky fate.

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,917
Some left behind a legacy.
In this wondrous world,

5
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:17,542
they continued their journey via racing.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,958
That is their destiny.

7
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,458
The race toward the best

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,458
is still unfinished.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,500
So they run

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,833
and run

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,917
toward the finishing line.

12
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,458
The horse girls
are heading into the third bend.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,750
Who will win the triple crown
of Satsuki Sho?

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,708
Me. It's going to be me.

15
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,833
I have never lost once.

16
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,417
I will win Satsuki Sho
like Tokai Teio did.

17
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,000
The popular Satono Crown
is following closely behind.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,125
Will we witness the birth
of the long-awaited Satsuki Sho champion?

19
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,833
Will Satono Crown
accomplish her family's wish?

20
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,958
Duramente!

21
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,417
She changed outward.

22
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:10,625
This is the final stretch.
Other athletes are closing in.

23
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,292
But the inside line
is occupied by the leading athletes.

24
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:13,750
Satono Crown is in the middle of the pack.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,042
Can she close the gap?

26
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,917
The final stretch isn't a long one.

27
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:20,167
In the final stretch,
Gentsu Steel appeared!

28
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,417
200 meters left.

29
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,375
Kitasan Black is accelerating.

30
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,583
Kitasan Black!

31
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,458
-I have to win this.
-Kitasan Black is in the inside line.

32
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,917
Can she overtake Kitasan Black? She did!

33
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,417
Gentsu Steel is taking a small lead.

34
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,917
Duramente appears on the side.

35
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,458
Duramente! Can you believe it?

36
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,833
She's so fast.

37
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,583
Has she always been this strong?

38
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,583
Duramente!

39
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,625
Astounding!

40
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,958
Duramente won Satsuki Sho.

41
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:50,542
Is this

42
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:51,625
-Yes!
-what you call

43
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,875
a god-given talent?

44
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,000
I can't believe it!

45
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:13,625
I…

46
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,042
I lost.

47
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,417
EPISODE 1: THE LINE IN SIGHT

48
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,375
TOKAI TEIO
CAN TEIO SURPASS THE EMPEROR?

49
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,625
KITASAN BLACK

50
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,708
Morning, Kita.

51
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,208
Morning, Diamond.

52
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,542
You're up early today. Be safe.

53
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:46,500
I will.

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,583
See you then.

55
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,083
See you.

56
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,708
SATONO DIAMOND

57
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,708
Satsuki Sho,

58
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,083
my first G1

59
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,667
and my first defeat.

60
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,042
Everyone is very strong there.

61
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:05,667
And the pressure is through the roof.

62
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,083
The next race will be the Japanese Derby.

63
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,958
The race everyone looks forward to.

64
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:15,083
I will race like the ever-awesome Teio.

65
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,333
Teio…

66
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,375
All right.

67
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,708
Here I come!

68
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,833
Eh?

69
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,667
Are you all right, ma'am?

70
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,083
My back hurts a bit

71
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,417
so I sat down to rest.

72
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,500
Where do you live? I can carry you back.

73
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,208
It's okay. I live nearby.

74
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:41,458
Grab tight.

75
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,292
Let's go!

76
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,208
Let's go!

77
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,708
Thank you.

78
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,792
You're welcome.

79
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:51,875
Goodbye.

80
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,792
All right.

81
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,167
Let's do this.

82
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,500
Eh?

83
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,000
How are you?

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,833
Do you know where Tokyo Racecourse is?

85
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,125
Pardon. I can't speak English.

86
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,708
"TOKYO RACECOURSE"
This one.

87
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,792
"TOKYO RACECOURSE"
Okay. Okay.

88
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay…

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,167
"CURRENT LOCATION"
This!

90
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,583
"HERE"
This is very detailed.

91
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,375
Good luck!

92
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:17,833
Done.

93
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,292
I should head back to Tracen Academy now.

94
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,708
A punctured tire!

95
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,750
You can run so fast.

96
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you, Kita.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,417
Don't mention it.

98
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,958
It helps with my training too.

99
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you so much.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,292
You're welcome.

101
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,583
Dad taught me to help others,

102
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,292
to cheer others,

103
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:46,458
and to put a smile on everyone's face.

104
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,500
You're so kind, Kita.

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
Ever so helpful.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
You are a great help.

107
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,583
I know, right? Your presence
always cheers everyone up.

108
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,625
Thank you, great helper!

109
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,208
By the way, what is the time now?

110
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,000
Morning.

111
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,917
What's taking Kita so long?

112
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,125
Sheesh.

113
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,958
Diamond!

114
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,458
I'm so sorry.

115
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,375
You shouldn't push yourself too far.

116
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,042
You just completed a race.

117
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,750
Right.

118
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:22,833
Come, Kita.

119
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,917
Okay.

120
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,875
What is the first period?

121
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,542
Home economics.

122
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,667
Urgh, that scary teacher again.

123
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:31,750
This first…

124
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,458
"HOMEMAKING ROOM"
This first…

125
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,750
"HOMEMAKING ROOM"
Then this…

126
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,167
Then this…

127
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,250
Ow!

128
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,792
Are you all right?

129
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,333
Show me your finger, Kita.

130
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,875
Thanks a lot, Diamond.

131
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,583
You have to be careful with needles.

132
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,917
"DERBY"
I couldn't stop thinking about the race.

133
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,875
"DERBY"
It's around the corner.

134
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:54,167
If only I could debut together with you.

135
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:55,958
Diamond…

136
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,500
Have you always been good at embroidering?

137
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,417
Not at all.

138
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,917
I merely follow
the teacher's instructions.

139
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:06,000
As expected from you then.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,375
You're a fast learner.

141
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,458
I am so clumsy compared to you.

142
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,458
DERBY

143
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:14,833
"JAPANESE DERBY"
Answer this question.

144
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:20,708
190,000 audiences cheered
as Ines Fujin won the Derby.

145
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,417
The next one who won…

146
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,000
-I know the answer.
-Yes, Kitasan Black?

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,250
It's Tokai Teio.

148
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,958
Exactly.

149
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,708
The one who won the Derby
before Mihono Bourbon…

150
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,292
It's Tokai Teio.

151
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,708
Yes.

152
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,042
Kita, you're on fire today.

153
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,625
Let's train together.

154
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,833
You're even more excited after school.

155
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,708
Because I get to see Teio in person.

156
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,000
If only you were on my team.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sorry that I went to another team…

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,125
For the Satono family,
that team holds a special meaning.

159
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,000
The trainers and other athletes
of Team Capella

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,458
are all fighting for their dreams.

161
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,208
We all share a common goal.

162
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,917
Here you are, Kita.

163
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,125
Yes, yes.

164
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,167
It is I, the come-and-go,

165
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,542
"SAKURA BAKUSHIN O"
Sakura Bakushin O.

166
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,708
See you later, Kita.

167
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,792
Diamond, wait for me!

168
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,292
After your debut,

169
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,042
I can tell that there's something special
to your gait.

170
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right. I can feel the dormant,

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,917
explosive power inside you.

172
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:27,083
I think you're perfect for a sprint.

173
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,875
So let's rise to the top of sprinting.

174
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,583
Come.

175
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,792
Uhm…

176
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,167
I'm in Spica now.

177
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,208
Sorry.

178
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,250
Why?

179
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,708
Sigh.

180
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,750
I know she means well.

181
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,375
She is quite nice, but…

182
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,375
As usual, you're the first, Kita.

183
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:56,583
Special! Suzuka!

184
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,792
"SPECIAL WEEK, SILENCE SUZUKA"
Special! Suzuka!

185
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:58,958
"SPECIAL WEEK, SILENCE SUZUKA"
Hello.

186
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,458
Thank you for cleaning up the place, Kita.

187
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,708
Don't mention it.

188
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,708
Here. Thanks for tidying up.

189
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,708
"DAIWA SCARLET, VODKA"
Thanks.

190
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,917
"DAIWA SCARLET, VODKA"
It was a gift, anyway.

191
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,167
Don't worry about it.

192
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,875
You bought it just now.

193
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:11,958
We agreed not to tell her!

194
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,500
Move aside.

195
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,792
"GOLD SHIP"
Move aside.

196
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:17,042
"GOLD SHIP"
I'm ready to fight Takarazuka Kinen…

197
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,042
All right. I'm done.

198
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,542
TEIO'S RACE

199
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,792
JAPANESE DERBY, TOKYO RACECOURSE
2,400M LAP

200
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,458
You're watching it again.

201
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,042
Don't you get sick of it,
watching it every day?

202
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:27,542
It's good to do some research.

203
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:30,917
I highly doubt she's researching.

204
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,000
She looks so awesome.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,208
She breezed through her rivals,

206
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,750
blitzed through her enemies.

207
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,000
Please do this when I'm not here.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,333
Teio!

209
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:43,667
You never change at all.

210
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,792
"TOKAI TEIO, MEJIRO MCQUEEN"
You never change at all.

211
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,792
"TOKAI TEIO, MEJIRO MCQUEEN"
Are you blushing?

212
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,125
Not at all.

213
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,292
Uhm, Teio.

214
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,083
When you competed in the Derby,

215
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,500
what went on in your mind before the race?

216
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,625
Hmm.

217
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,875
I thought about the winner's interview.

218
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,750
She was already thinking about
the things to do after the victory.

219
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,292
I—I see…

220
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,333
Woah.

221
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,333
Also, I thought about proving
my worth to Rudolf.

222
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,333
What about you, Special?

223
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,042
I could only think about charging in.

224
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,375
You're all here.

225
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,542
Get changed and gather by the track.

226
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,833
Don't be late.

227
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:22,958
Listen up, Kita.

228
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,875
The track in this Derby is 400 meters
longer than the track in Satsuki Sho.

229
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,167
The straights in Fuchu are long,

230
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,208
which are not great
for runners of your type.

231
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:37,125
You'll meet runners who save up a burst
like Crown or Duramente.

232
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,750
However, it's too risky
to change your gait now,

233
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,542
so you will play it to your advantage.

234
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,917
You'll focus on your stamina,
and then, your endurance.

235
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,208
Run at your own pace.

236
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,500
Do not be distracted by your rivals.

237
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,792
"DURAMENTE"
Do not be distracted by your rivals.

238
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,292
Let's give it a try first.

239
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,708
Yes!

240
00:09:55,708 --> 00:10:01,125
Go!

241
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,083
Kita is very motivated.

242
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:03,917
Indeed.

243
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:10,333
Charge!

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,708
Kitasan Black.

245
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:12,917
Crown.

246
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:13,875
"SATONO CROWN"
Crown.

247
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,167
"SATONO CROWN"
Do you think you can win the Derby?

248
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,000
Do you think you can win the Derby?

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,625
I will.

250
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,500
I have to.

251
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,000
The angle I took in Satsuki Sho
put me at a disadvantage.

252
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,958
I have to improve myself
before I win the race.

253
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,125
Yeah.

254
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,958
I will win the first G1

255
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,458
for our family.

256
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,000
If this carries on…

257
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,958
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

258
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,917
DERBY

259
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,625
Derby…

260
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,125
A once-in-a-lifetime stage.

261
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,292
The same tournament Teio took part in.

262
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,708
I have to…

263
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:26,625
Tomorrow is the day.
Who do you think will win?

264
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,167
Duramente, I think.

265
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,875
She is very strong.

266
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,542
Some might even say she's a prodigy.

267
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,083
You may cross now.

268
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,458
Satono Crown might win too.

269
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,500
She is promising.

270
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,625
What about Kitasan Black?

271
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,500
She was very close last time.

272
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,333
But the track there is too long for her.

273
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,417
Kita.

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,958
Diamond, are you going back now?

275
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,083
Yes. You train very hard every day.

276
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,083
Because Derby is around the corner.

277
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,708
I'll get changed now. Give me a minute.

278
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,625
Okay.

279
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,667
As you can see here,

280
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,333
the streets of Fuchu
are teeming with people

281
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,417
on the eve of the Japanese Derby.

282
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,417
Everyone is excited.

283
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,000
-I can't wait.
-Yeah.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,292
I can't wait.

285
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,500
I can't wait.

286
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
I can't wait.

287
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't wait.

288
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,583
Yummy.

289
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,250
Diamond.

290
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,250
How is Crown doing?

291
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,417
She's quite relaxed

292
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,375
and she told me
that she was in great form.

293
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,542
I see.

294
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:43,500
It's unusual of you to ask about others.

295
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,250
Oh.

296
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,375
If you were racing in the Derby tomorrow,

297
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,708
what do you think you'd think about
when you're running?

298
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,958
Winning the race.

299
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,375
That's all.

300
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,667
My family's curse will not be broken

301
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,000
unless I have a firm resolution.

302
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,875
No one can predict the outcome,

303
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,583
but…

304
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:13,375
But you will definitely lose
if you don't have faith in yourself.

305
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,125
Don't you agree, Kita?

306
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,500
I…

307
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:30,000
G1 is still new to me.

308
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,542
I'm seeing so many new things.

309
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,500
And the Derby is…

310
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,833
It's going to be more overwhelming.

311
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,625
I can't be as confident as everyone.

312
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:43,000
I see.

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,875
So you are afraid of the race.

314
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,708
I think so, yeah.

315
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,625
No matter how hard I train,
I feel like I don't stand a chance.

316
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,917
I'm scared.

317
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,583
Let me interview the public.

318
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,083
The Japanese Derby is tomorrow.

319
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,042
Yes, my kid is looking forward to it.

320
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,167
Yes!

321
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,583
It's like a festival!

322
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,667
It's like a festival.

323
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,750
She's such a cute girl, Kita.

324
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,208
Kita?

325
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,625
Festival…

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,292
A festival.

327
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,208
-It is a festival.
-Yes.

328
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,625
It is a festival.

329
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,917
I…

330
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,542
The energetic, cheerful,

331
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,750
the one who puts
a smile on everyone's faces…

332
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,917
For me, Derby is…

333
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,292
Kita?

334
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,333
Diamond.

335
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,458
I think I can do it.

336
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,667
I'll go and get some taiyaki.

337
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,042
Yes, I'll be fine.

338
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:58,667
Derby is just a festival.

339
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,500
And I love festivals.

340
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
So, I…

341
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,500
"SPECIAL TAIYAKI"
Two taiyakis, please.

342
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,625
"SPECIAL TAIYAKI"
Custard and…

343
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,917
"SPECIAL TAIYAKI"
Custard for both.

344
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,667
The Japanese Derby will begin soon.

345
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,792
How will the horse girls perform?
What will happen?

346
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,750
We are all waiting for the answers.

347
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,792
Mr. Yamamoto.

348
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,542
Pleased to work with you today.

349
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,375
Likewise.

350
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,208
Winning this race

351
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,583
means you are the fastest
and the No. 1 horse girl in the world.

352
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,792
They will do their best
to bring us a thrilling race.

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,708
This is Derby.

354
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,583
I will run happily, joyfully.

355
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,917
I will be my true self.

356
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,333
Remember, your pacing is very important.

357
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,417
Don't be intimidated
by the atmosphere or your rivals.

358
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,042
All the best.

359
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:51,042
Kita, you have this.

360
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:54,083
Enjoy the nervousness too.

361
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:55,750
Kita.

362
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,958
Be yourself, okay?

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes!

364
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,167
Here she is,
the highly-anticipated horse girl.

365
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,708
"DURAMENTE, PREVIOUSLY ON SATSUKI SHO"
She won Satsuki Sho

366
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,792
"DURAMENTE, PREVIOUSLY ON SATSUKI SHO"
with her overwhelming speed.

367
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,208
"DURAMENTE, PREVIOUSLY ON SATSUKI SHO"
I hope she can get the triple crown.

368
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,292
She showed us the burst
she is capable of in Nakayama.

369
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,833
In this long, straight running track,

370
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,917
will we witness her burst again?

371
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,542
"SATONO CROWN, PREVIOUSLY ON SATSUKI SHO"
Next, Satono Crown.

372
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,167
"SATONO CROWN, PREVIOUSLY ON SATSUKI SHO"
On her quest to winning G1,

373
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,208
"SATONO CROWN, PREVIOUSLY ON SATSUKI SHO"
what will she show us today?

374
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,208
Her previous score does not
put her in an advantageous position

375
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,000
but if she finds her rhythm here,

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,625
she can and will win this race.

377
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,167
I can't lose. I must win.

378
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,458
I

379
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,958
will break this curse.

380
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,917
Here, the 3rd place in Satsuki Sho,

381
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,458
Kitasan Black.

382
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:45,167
I heard she trained very hard
for this race.

383
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,458
She does not look fatigued though.

384
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,375
She looks motivated.

385
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,458
I can't wait for her performance.

386
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:07,208
That was where I cheered for Teio.

387
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,708
All right then.

388
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,000
G1, JAPANESE DERBY, TOKYO YUSHUN
TOKYO RACECOURSE, 2,400M COURSE

389
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:38,042
The biggest race that decides
the champion of horse girls,

390
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:40,375
Tokyo Yushun, Japanese Derby.

391
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,000
18 horse girls, each carrying a dream

392
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,292
on their shoulders

393
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,625
enter the starting gate.

394
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,750
Everything is in position now.

395
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,667
May destiny lead them to their glory.

396
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,625
No, they will earn glory with sheer will!

397
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,375
Start!

398
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,792
6 had a later start,

399
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,208
but everyone was off to a great start.

400
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,958
Which one of them will reach
the spectator's stand first?

401
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,375
-Go!
-Will it be

402
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,292
America Spike?

403
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:09,250
Kitasan Black approached the middle now.

404
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,500
Ribbon Pia is in the lead,

405
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,042
but how long can she maintain it?

406
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,792
Kitasan Black is following closely behind.

407
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,292
The cheering is loud.

408
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,792
As if it could crush me.

409
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,000
But…

410
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,333
We're now heading to the most difficult
part, the first bend.

411
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,708
The luckiest one
will always win the Derby.

412
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,375
Such as Eishin Flash,
Tanino Gimlet, and Special Week.

413
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,667
Records show it's usually won
by the third place of Satsuki Sho.

414
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,750
Why is that?

415
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,167
Do you know who is the third place
in this year's Satsuki Sho?

416
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,083
That's right. It's Kitasan Black.

417
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,333
I see.

418
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,125
After the difficult second bend,
they have arrived at the straight.

419
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,750
Let's see who has the lead.

420
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,208
Ribbon Pia is first,

421
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,750
followed by Kitasan Black.

422
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,167
Duramente is in the middle.

423
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,958
Can Satono Crown redeem herself here?

424
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,917
It says 58.8 seconds
when they crossed the 1,000-meter mark.

425
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,042
Too fast.

426
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:02,250
Kita got carried away.

427
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,167
The sun is glaring
in the Tokyo Racecourse.

428
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,792
She's the only one ahead of me.

429
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,625
I can see the finishing line now.

430
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,417
We are now at the fourth bend.

431
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:18,000
After this is the final stretch.

432
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,208
Everything is at stake.

433
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,083
-I can do this.
-Everything is at stake.

434
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,583
-From here to the finishing line…
-The final stretch of this race.

435
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,333
-I have to win.
-The final stretch of this race.

436
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,625
-I must win.
-Go.

437
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,292
Kitasan Black and Ribbon
are going neck and neck.

438
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,833
Go!

439
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,958
Ribbon will not concede either.

440
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,042
I'm so close. So close.

441
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,875
They won't give up that easily.

442
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,792
Kitasan Black is still chasing.

443
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,458
Will one of them win this race?

444
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,958
But it's too early to say.

445
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,958
This long final stretch

446
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,708
is their one-way ticket to glory.

447
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,000
18 horse girls are giving their all.

448
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,792
Here she is.

449
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:57,000
Duramente accelerated.

450
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,833
I won't lose. The fight is just starting!

451
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,708
The final 200 meters!

452
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,167
Duramente is in the lead.

453
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,083
No. The finishing line is not here yet.

454
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:20,208
Duramente takes the lead!

455
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,042
Duramente!

456
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,875
Duramente!

457
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,583
She is so fast.

458
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,542
She overtook everyone.

459
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:34,792
Duramente got two crowns!

460
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:37,667
No one can stop her!

461
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,000
She overtook everyone in seconds!

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,167
Incredible!

463
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:46,500
Duramente has obtained
two of the three crowns!

464
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,125
Yes!

465
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,375
What is her ranking?

466
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,792
I think…

467
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,042
14th.

468
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,292
If I'm not mistaken.

469
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,958
2 minutes 23.2 seconds.

470
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,583
That is the record for this year's Derby.

471
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,208
Without a doubt, it's a landslide victory!

472
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,750
Please cheer for Duramente!

473
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,250
I lost…
