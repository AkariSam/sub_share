00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,160
FUKUNAGA COMMERCIAL STREET

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,000
Phew.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,380
I'm beat.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,800
Darling, come!

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,620
What's the matter? Why are you yelling?

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,040
Just come with me now.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,520
Geez. What could be possibly...

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,460
Kita?

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,980
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,010
"EPISODE 12: KITASAN BLACK"
Thank you for coming

11
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,120
to this press conference.

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,560
I asked Mr. Trainer to gather you here

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,500
because I have a big announcement to make.

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,400
I, Kitasan Black,

15
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,100
will retire from Twinkle Series

16
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,300
after completing this year's races.

17
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,500
I have always been able to complete
all my races safely so far.

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,060
And after each training or race,
I wouldn't feel tired.

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,460
But after the previous Tenno Sho,
I can visibly feel

20
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,800
that my body is not what it used to be.

21
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,320
I believe this is the final year

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,280
that I can deliver my best performance.

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,260
And that's why
I made the decision to retire.

24
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,100
Which race will you participate in next?

25
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,700
Japan Cup.

26
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,240
And

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,300
Arima Kinen will be my last race.

28
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,640
I will do my best

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,340
and race without regrets.

30
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,720
I count on your continuous support.

31
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,700
Why?

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,980
She just won Tenno Sho.

33
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,500
We know when our body is failing us.

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,920
Kita must have felt that way.

35
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,920
So she found the best time to retire
and announced it.

36
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,860
Huh?

37
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,700
Yet,

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,900
she continues to chase after
the title of all titles,

39
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,400
the autumn triple crown.

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Is she doing this on purpose or not?
We don't know.

41
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,620
She knows how to present herself
and commands attention.

42
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,360
It seems like

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,720
"ROYCE AND ROYCE"
she is approaching

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,340
"ROYCE AND ROYCE"
her final match with an attitude

45
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,740
that's more than veneration.

46
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,480
I see.

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,780
Thank you, everyone.

48
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,100
Don't mention it. It's nothing at all.

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,980
-Kitasan...
-Quit crying, Special.

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
Diamond, thank you for being here too.

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,900
Mhm.

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,140
Don't mention it.

53
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,500
You will begin training
for Japan Cup tomorrow.

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,580
Please put me through a stricter training.

56
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,620
Well...

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,800
I have decided

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,820
to do my best in my last matches.

59
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,820
So, please...

60
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,220
All right.

61
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,840
Thank you so much!

62
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,640
Cheval.

63
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,100
Did you watch Kitasan's press conference?

64
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,660
Yes.

65
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,840
I joined halfway through.

66
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
I see.

67
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,020
It must be lonely.

68
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,820
She has always been with us.

69
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,660
Huh?

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,620
Lonely...

71
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,480
HISHI AKEBONO

72
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,660
Groove.

73
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,400
You're calling me that again...

74
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,320
Whatever.

75
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,700
Please focus on your training.

76
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,780
Or you'll hurt yourself.

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,520
Is Kitasan's press conference
bothering you?

78
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,720
Yes.

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,020
I can't recover fast enough.

80
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,900
I promised to race with her.

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,940
I want to race with her,
compete against her.

82
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,300
This is a shame.

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,940
You know, regrets can give you
the motivation to strive for better.

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,820
Remember this feeling and maybe
you can make up for it in the future.

85
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,960
If fate wills it, that is.

86
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,940
Hopefully.

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,280
KITASAN BLACK TO RETIRE
FROM TWINKLE SERIES

88
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,820
Phew.

89
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,080
I pulled my back.

90
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,980
I pulled my back...

91
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,660
Are you okay?

92
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,740
Don't worry about me...

93
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,380
Are you a student from Tracen Academy?

94
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,100
Yes, I started in April.

95
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
Are you trying to offload the boxes?

96
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Let me help you.

97
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,260
No need. I don't want to bother you.

98
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,860
It's no bother at all.

99
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,480
I am confident in my strength.

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,700
Watch me.

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,560
I can do this.

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,260
You're my saviour.

103
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,920
Thank you, little girl.

104
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,260
My dad told me

105
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,680
to help those in need

106
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,660
and smile at those who are sad

107
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,780
so that everyone would smile always.

108
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,140
Oh.

109
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,940
I should go now.

110
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,040
Wait.

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,540
What's your name, little girl?

112
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm Kitasan Black.

113
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,380
So she's quitting the Twinkle Series…

114
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,380
How long do you have to mope around for?

115
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,020
But...

116
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,280
Kita has two more races left.

117
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,380
Are you going to watch her performance
with a sulking face?

118
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,500
You're right.

119
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,600
What we can do for her is to cheer
for her loudly and passionately.

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,020
That's right.

121
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,560
Now, let's open the shop.

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,520
All right.

123
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,260
Time to work.

124
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,100
TAKE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

125
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,740
I pulled my back.

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,080
Which lap is it?

127
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,220
The third lap.

128
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,440
This was nothing to her in the past.

129
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,540
Yeah...

130
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,540
She's trying so hard to delay
her waning strength.

131
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,340
To do that, she can only engage in
plain training like this.

132
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,940
She can do it.

133
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,640
Slowly improving from ordinary training
is her forté.

134
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,040
Yeah.

135
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,040
You're working very hard, Crown.

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,160
Because I can't lose.

137
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,160
I nearly caught up to her in Tenno Sho.

138
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,680
But right when I decided to avenge
myself in the next match,

139
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,280
she...

140
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,360
Crown, you have faced Kitasan
Black six times in the classics.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,320
We're in the same batch. We are rivals

142
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,720
and friends.

143
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,280
When I heard that Kita is retiring...

144
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,060
How should I put this?

145
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,800
It's like your childhood playmate
suddenly moves away.

146
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,880
She has two races left.

147
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
Seeing her determination,

148
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to work hard too.

149
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,840
Yeah.

150
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,740
Diamond, you won't sign up for the race?

151
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,480
Huh?

152
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Arima Kinen, I mean.

153
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,720
This might be your last chance
to race with Kitasan.

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,380
If you're voted in by your fans...

155
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,760
But I don't think I can perform my best
at the moment.

156
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,400
Is it because
of Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe?

157
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,640
Yeah.

158
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,760
France has a different racecourse
and a different track elevation.

159
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,280
It's so different from Japan
that it's like a whole new sport.

160
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,520
To win Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe,

161
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,260
I need to be ready

162
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,800
to give up what I have learned
and start from zero.

163
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,560
Even if I do that, I can't say
for sure if I'll win.

164
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,820
What is my goal?

165
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,860
What is the reason I run?

166
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,940
If I don't have an answer to them,

167
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,340
I won't be able to progress.

168
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,060
Taking your time to sort it out
is not a bad idea either.

169
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,900
Hm?

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,000
Some answers only appear
when you pause and rest.

171
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,280
Thanks, Crown.

172
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,400
Cheval, you're here.

173
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,620
Is something the matter?

174
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,240
We're having dinner together.

175
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,620
Do you want to join us?

176
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,940
No, thanks.

177
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,220
What's the matter, Cheval?

178
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,460
Do you have an upset tummy?

179
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,120
No...

180
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,840
She's sulking because of Kitasan.

181
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,400
Why... Why would I?

182
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,700
Are you disappointed

183
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,300
or sad?

184
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,220
I'm not happy.

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,200
When I heard that Kitasan is retiring,

186
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,800
what I want to say is "Why?"

187
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,840
I have never defeated her.

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,300
How dare she quit now.

189
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I understand what you're feeling.

190
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,680
Huh?

191
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,120
You're jealous of her.
She makes you anxious.

192
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,980
Yet somehow, you want to be her
and you can't take your eyes off her.

193
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
You're envious and jealous of her.

194
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,820
It's like being in an unrequited love.

195
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,980
In the end, I couldn't defeat her at all.

196
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,500
But you still have the chance.

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,800
Two chances, in fact.

198
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,780
Verxina...

199
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,040
That's right.

200
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,020
During clutch moments,

201
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,320
you can be more focused
than Verxina and me.

202
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,700
Two more chances, huh?

203
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,000
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

204
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,140
Now that I think about it,

205
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
I could barely handle her
at the beginning.

206
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,780
"WELCOME TO THE ACADEMY"
She's cheerful and outgoing.

207
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,260
-I'm... I'm Cheval Grand.
-She gets along with everyone easily.

208
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,720
-My goal is to win G1.
-She's the opposite of me.

209
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,560
She's like Verxina or Vivlos.

210
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm Kitasan Black.

211
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,880
My goal is to become a famous
horse girl like Tokai Teio.

212
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,160
To do that, I need to win many races

213
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,540
and win the classic triple crown.

214
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,920
Nice to meet you.

215
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,380
She proclaims her ambition
loudly and openly.

216
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,140
She's tough and has the stamina.

217
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,000
She possesses everything I want.

218
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,900
Truth be told,

219
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,620
I envy her.

220
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,400
I don't want to give up
so I tried very hard.

221
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,880
Yet I could never be like her.

222
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,740
No matter how daunting the obstacles are,

223
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,320
she'll work hard and overcome them.

224
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,260
So I don't

225
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,420
want to lose to her.

226
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,440
I don't want to.

227
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,840
I want to defeat her.

228
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,000
I want to defeat the strongest horse girl
of our generation,

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,740
Kitasan Black.

230
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,720
So no matter how far behind I am,

231
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,360
I won't give up.

232
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,660
Because

233
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm just like her.

234
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,160
I will train, train, and train

235
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,860
until I slowly catch up to her.

236
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,960
And next time...

237
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,080
I will overtake the shadow before me.

238
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,400
The crisp opening music echoes
through the autumn sky.

239
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,920
An international G1 event, Japan Cup,
is about to begin.

240
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,260
Kitasan Black remains the most
highly anticipated horse girl in the race.

241
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,120
Yes, she announced her intention
to quit Twinkle Series.

242
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,160
Many fans gathered here
to watch her performance again.

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,020
All horse girls proceed
to the gates confidently.

244
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,780
The popular Kitasan Black
is ready in Gate 4.

245
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,900
All horse girls are here.

246
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,160
The last to enter the gate
is No. 17, Big Subject.

247
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,700
The race starts now!

248
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,280
Everyone is vying for the lead.

249
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,380
No. 4, Kitasan Black charges out.

250
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,340
Nice! She's off to a good start.

251
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,820
Yes, and she's focused.

252
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,740
Go!

253
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,040
Kitasan's silhouette
is before me as usual.

254
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,440
Kitasan takes the lead as always.

255
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,460
But today,

256
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,220
I won't let you get away with it.

257
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,660
Japan Cup is an international G1 race.

258
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,880
Foreign horse girls are invited
and it is often a tough match.

259
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,100
Why say this all of a sudden?

260
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,920
The lap is 2,400-meter long,
which is the real "classic'" length,

261
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,440
on par with other international turfs
like Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

262
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,360
At times, a new record will be set,
to everyone's surprise.

263
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,720
To make sure that they don't fall behind,
the stamina they train

264
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
allows them to...

265
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,580
What?

266
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,560
Kitasan Black only has two races left.

267
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,020
I will devote all my attention
to her performance.

268
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,240
-Yeah.
-Me too.

269
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,300
The first 1,000-meter lap is completed
in 60.02 seconds.

270
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,960
Leading the race is none other

271
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,940
than the Festival Girl, Kitasan Black.

272
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,160
You can do this, Kita.

273
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,560
Go!

274
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,920
I failed to catch up to her in Tenno Sho,

275
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,900
but this time, I'll overtake her.

276
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,600
Go, Crown!

277
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,520
Kitasan Black is leading by 1.5 lengths.

278
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,980
Messy Eater takes the second spot.
One Life takes the third.

279
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,640
Cheval Grand is on the inside line
and she's in fourth place.

280
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,280
Go, Cheval!

281
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,260
All the best!

282
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
Kitasan Black...

283
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,120
I hate you.

284
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
We have the opposite personality.

285
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,080
Everyone loves you.

286
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,000
You smile a lot. You're always energetic.

287
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm cold and aloof. Yet you barged
into my world again and again.

288
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,900
They just passed the sign
that says there are 600 meters left.

289
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,120
Kitasan Black and the horse girls behind
passed the fourth bend into the stretch.

290
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,600
Kitasan Black is still in the lead.

291
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,520
She takes charge of the race.

292
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,140
Oh!

293
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,100
Here she is.

294
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,460
Cheval Grand charges in from the back.

295
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,700
She set her eyes on Kitasan Black.

296
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,860
Kitasan Black.

297
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,220
I hate you.

298
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,380
You're always running in front of me,

299
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,840
telling me how immature and pathetic I am.

300
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,960
You're an eyesore.

301
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,720
So annoying.

302
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,960
Yet

303
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,520
so dazzling.

304
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,280
I don't know when it began.

305
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,940
But I can't take my eyes off you.

306
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,340
It's Cheval Grand. She closes in.

307
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,760
Kitasan Black.

308
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,040
I hate you.

309
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,220
You're the reason why

310
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,100
I'm here.

311
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,600
To chase after your shadow,

312
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,720
I didn't give up
and worked so hard until now.

313
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,980
Kitasan Black.

314
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,400
I...

315
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,280
I truly

316
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,460
love you a lot.

317
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,740
She's picking up her pace again?

318
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,600
Cheval Grand is not slowing down.

319
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,780
She's closing the gap
between her and Kitasan Black.

320
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,320
It's Cheval Grand!

321
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,600
She has the lead now.

322
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,100
She overtook Kitasan Black and secures
the first spot.

323
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,060
Atari also appears on the flank.

324
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,840
Can Kitasan Black
show us another burst of speed?

325
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,580
No, Cheval Grand is superior.

326
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,600
She overtook Kitasan.

327
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,040
Cheval Grand has the lead.

328
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,660
Cheval Grand!

329
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,320
Cheval Grand crosses the finishing line

330
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,780
with her lead!

331
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,520
She defeated the other horse girls

332
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,260
and won Japan Cup.

333
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,920
This is her first G1 trophy!

334
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,200
It's her seventh G1 race,

335
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,900
and she finally won her first trophy!

336
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,680
She overtook Kitasan Black,
who had the lead,

337
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,060
and outran Atari to victory.

338
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,320
She showed us her amazing speed
in this important tournament.

339
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,260
Well done, Cheval. Good job!

340
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,820
Congratulations, Cheval.

341
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,580
We three are now G1 champions!

342
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,780
I...

343
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,460
I did it.

344
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,640
Congratulations, Cheval.

345
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,660
Mm.

346
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,680
Thank you, Kitasan.

347
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,920
Kitasan...

348
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,840
I will surpass you and become
a better horse girl.

349
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,480
Mm.

350
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,540
Well done! What a thrilling match!

351
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,560
I will be there for your next match too.

352
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,760
Do your best in Arima Kinen!

353
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,080
It will be your last race.

354
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,180
We will be there to cheer for you!

355
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,240
Arima Kinen.

356
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,420
Is that so?

357
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,900
The next race is...

358
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,880
Kita.

359
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,080
The live performance is over.
What are you doing here?

360
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,460
It'll be my last visit to Tokyo Racecourse
in the Twinkle Series,

361
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,700
so I want to take a good look at it.

362
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,340
I see.

363
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,300
My debut race was here too.

364
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,080
I can still recall how nervous I was.

365
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,240
Derby too.

366
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,320
Dura has such powerful techniques.

367
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,980
Yeah.

368
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,440
From Tenno Sho to Japan Cup,

369
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,040
I have raced many times here.

370
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,060
Yeah.

371
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,080
Diamond.

372
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,980
Remember the time I told you I wondered
what it was like to run in my final race?

373
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,000
Huh?

374
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,000
I have the answer now.

375
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,260
It feels awful.

376
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,660
Kita...

377
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,940
The next race will be my final race.

378
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,580
Arima Kinen.

379
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,660
I want to win it so badly.
