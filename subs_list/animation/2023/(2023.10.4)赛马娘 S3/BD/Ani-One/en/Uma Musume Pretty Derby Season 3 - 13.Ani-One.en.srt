1
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,990
ARIMA KINEN

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,540
One race left.

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,940
The next race

4
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,320
will be my final race in Twinkle Series.

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,660
Her performance is back.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,500
She's burning whatever is left in her
to deliver the best performance.

7
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,160
I'll run another lap.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,300
Crown?

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,540
Good luck.

10
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,320
Kitasan is very motivated today.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,480
She'll regret it if her last performance
is less than spectacular.

12
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,060
That's why she's training so hard.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,600
You can't lose to her, Cheval.

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,640
I will not.

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,740
Are you all right, Kitasan?

16
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,640
Yes, I'm fine.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,620
Let's call it a day here.

18
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,200
Go back and rest
after you're done stretching.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,580
Noted. Thanks a lot!

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,420
Is there something I can do for Kitasan?

21
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,290
Right? I feel the same way too.

22
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,680
"EPISODE 13: AND SO YOU…"
Right? I feel the same way too.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,440
"EPISODE 13: AND SO YOU…"
What can I do for her?

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,520
What can I do…

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,020
Hmm…

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,600
What can I do for her?

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,540
Hi, everyone.

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,600
Hi, Kitasan.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,740
Here. Your special drink.

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,140
We're using a special recipe today.

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,300
Thank you.

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,580
All of you are always so supportive.

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,040
Don't mention it.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,240
Hmm. We will always be there for you.

35
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
Guys…

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm so happy to be part of Spica.

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,320
Do you have something you want?

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,420
Uhm…

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,220
Can I ask you for a favour?

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,520
Have you checked out
the mid-fan voting presentation?

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,300
Yes, Kitasan Black has
the highest number of votes.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,220
"ARIMA KINEN, DECEMBER 24TH"
I did not expect anything less.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,720
"ARIMA KINEN SPECIAL: KITASAN'S LAST RACE"
In Takarazuka and Arima,

44
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,760
"ARIMA KINEN SPECIAL: KITASAN'S LAST RACE"
she was voted the fans' favourite,

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,900
"KITASAN BLACK QUITS AFTER ARIMA KINEN"
she was voted the fans' favourite,

46
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,600
"KITASAN BLACK QUITS AFTER ARIMA KINEN"
but she failed to win the race.

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,300
"KITASAN BLACK IN TIP-TOP SHAPE"
She has already won several G1.

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,600
"KITASAN BLACK IN TIP-TOP SHAPE"
I hope she wins her last one.

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,260
I hope she wins her last one.

50
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm sure Kitasan Black can win
in Arima Kinen.

51
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,660
I doubt she'll be in bad shape.

52
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,500
She almost won Japan Cup back then too.

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,380
Yeah.

54
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,040
Despite losing the race, she had
the lead during the early stage.

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,160
We won't be able to see her run anymore.

56
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,320
What a shame.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,500
Yeah, it's her last match.
I can't miss out.

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,880
Hmm.

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,100
We will do our best to cheer for her.
Leave no regrets!

60
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,200
Yes!

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,420
My husband and I will be in Nakayama
Racecourse to watch the race.

62
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,320
Me too!

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,780
I just need to be there for her.

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,360
My husband rewatched all her races,
starting from her debut race.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,580
My husband did that too.

66
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,920
How popular do you think
she'll be on that day?

67
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,140
The most popular one, of course.

68
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,420
Right.

69
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,100
She'll end her journey with a bang.

70
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,300
I'm sure Kitasan can do it.

71
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,240
Dad, will Kita win?

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
I think she will.

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,680
She will train very hard to win the race.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,540
Then I'll cheer very hard for her too!

75
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,100
I have always yearned

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,400
and longed to create

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
a festive scene.

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,200
I was so close,

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,640
but

80
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,860
I failed.

81
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,760
However,

82
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,980
I must give my best performance
for those who have been cheering for me.

83
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,540
I want them to watch
my final race with a smile.

84
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,760
Kita.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,340
Teio.

86
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,520
Good job today.

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,460
Everyone is working very hard
to make your wish come true.

88
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,580
Thank you.

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,500
The day has come.

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Yes.

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,780
Finally.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,620
I… want to win.

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,140
This is my last race.

94
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,320
I must win it.

95
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,280
I see.

96
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,940
I'm sure everyone thinks that way.

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,100
No one runs to lose.

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,300
Still, there can only be one winner.

99
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,700
However, I'm sure the winner

100
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,500
belongs to someone who perseveres

101
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,560
till the very end, regardless

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,600
of how challenging and daunting
the circumstances are.

103
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,740
I see that in you, Kitasan.

104
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,800
You never give up.

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,800
Teio…

106
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah!

107
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,860
The end of the year is nigh.
Today is Christmas Eve.

108
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,660
"G1, ARIMA KINEN, NAKAYAMA, 2,500M LAP"
The end of the year is nigh.
Today is Christmas Eve.

109
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,900
"G1, ARIMA KINEN, NAKAYAMA, 2,500M LAP"
During this festive season,

110
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,820
During this festive season,

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,460
Arima Kinen will unfold
in Nakayama Racecourse.

112
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,480
We have gathered a stellar lineup today.

113
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,540
Who will win the final grand event
of the year?

114
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,580
I can't wait to find out.

115
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,020
Me too.

116
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm sure those watching the live broadcast

117
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,260
can feel the heat
and the passion at the scene too.

118
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,980
I'll be reporting before the horse station
in Nakayama Racecourse today.

119
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,460
Let's go!

120
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,740
Which horse girl

121
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,960
will play Santa Claus
and deliver the present

122
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,560
to more than 100,000 spectators here?

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,620
This is the moment.

124
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,340
The race will begin shortly.

125
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,440
Kitasan, you look awesome.

126
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,000
I love it.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,420
It's perfect on you.

128
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,700
Thanks a lot.

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,540
It's rare to see Kitasan in short pants.

130
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,640
Do you like it? It's perfect for running.

131
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,000
The cape was my idea.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,100
The shoulder pad is beautiful too.

133
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,900
You look like a leader.

134
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,300
Right? That's my idea.

135
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,160
You can't even see my design
on the uniform…

136
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,640
Thank you for designing my uniform.

137
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,240
-My design…
-I will complete the race for Spica.

138
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,580
Hmm…

139
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,400
I wish I had this treatment too
when I was going through this.

140
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,320
Quit complaining.

141
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,700
I know it sounds weird,

142
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,660
but please, come back safely.

143
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,780
Okay.

144
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,120
Here I go then.

145
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,480
All athletes are waiting
for the signal at their gates.

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,920
Sounds of Earth is the runner-up
for three G1 races and four G2 races.

147
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,380
She was very close to first place.

148
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,040
We can't judge her
based on her recent performance,

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
but let's see if she can
get her first trophy

150
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,320
at the end of the year.

151
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,180
Good luck, Earth!

152
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,700
She looks

153
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,680
very confident.

154
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
Yup.

155
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,920
Arima Kinen is the final race of the year.

156
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,320
It is also Kitasan Black's final race.

157
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,620
Now is the best opportunity
to make herself known.

158
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,500
You can do this, Earth.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,660
Speaking of trophies, I feel compelled
to mention the champion

160
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,940
of Japan Cup, Cheval Grand.
She is here with us today too.

161
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,240
Will she show us the deadly
acceleration she did in Japan Cup?

162
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,600
The champion of Takarazuka Kinen,
Satono Crown, is worthy of note too.

163
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,960
Can she redeem herself

164
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
in this racecourse?

165
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,660
You can do this, Crown!

166
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,220
And then, it's the fans' favourite.

167
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,460
She deserves her spot in the fans' voting.

168
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,820
She was the Horse Girl
of the Year last year.

169
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,480
If she wins this race, she'll become
the horse girl with the most G1 trophies.

170
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,980
Kitasan Black!

171
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,280
It's her last race.

172
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,120
I hope she can retire without any regrets.

173
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,160
It's my last race in the Twinkle Series.

174
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,680
This anxiety…

175
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,740
It'll be my last time feeling it.

176
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,720
All right. It begins now.

177
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,060
The final grand prix of the year.

178
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,440
Arima Kinen.

179
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,980
On this wintry day, determined horse girls

180
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,340
enter the horse gates accordingly.

181
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,700
Their stage is ready.

182
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,420
The end-of-year grand prix, Arima Kinen.

183
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,010
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

184
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,060
It starts now!

185
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,960
Kitasan Black is off
to a good start, as usual.

186
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,560
She's leading on the inside line.

187
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,580
She has a solid lead.

188
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,020
But 2,500 meters is a long journey.

189
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,400
Kitasan Black continues to lead.

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,600
There are six bends in this racecourse.

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,860
They blitzed by the first one
and are now charging at the second.

192
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,500
She's off to a good start.

193
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,180
That's right.

194
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,840
Keep it up!

195
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,520
All the best, Kitasan.

196
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,980
Kitasan Black is in the lead.

197
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,480
Moon Hero takes the second place.

198
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Coming from the flank is another veteran,
Canon Millefeuille.

199
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,940
On the inside line is Crescent Ace.

200
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,000
Behind her is It's Calling.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,700
Read Poetry tails behind her

202
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,760
while Sounds of Earth is in last place.

203
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,600
All 16 horse girls
are passing by the spectator stands.

204
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,880
Everyone is waiting for her.

205
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,940
Kitasan Black, it's her final race.

206
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,420
Let's look at the big screen.

207
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,680
She must have seen the lap time.

208
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,960
How is the race? How is her pace?

209
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,760
Did she give her all?

210
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,900
The first 1,000 meters is completed
in 61.6 seconds.

211
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,600
Not bad. It's her usual pace.

212
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,500
That's right.

213
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,560
She has the lead, as usual.

214
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,500
Hmm.

215
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,020
But she seems to be in pain.

216
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,180
What?

217
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,660
If I relax a bit…

218
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,340
If I slow down…

219
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,020
If someone catches up to me…

220
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,680
I must…

221
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm watching Kita's race with everyone.

222
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,480
I wish to stay in this moment forever.

223
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,360
Kita has become part of our life.

224
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
Let's memorize this moment.

225
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,400
Save your lament for later.

226
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,800
Kita is doing her best out there.

227
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,060
We must cheer loudly for her.

228
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,700
Right.

229
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,700
Kitasan Black controls the pace
of the race.

230
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,980
This is her final race.

231
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,600
Can she give her career
the perfect ending?

232
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,380
The second place, Moon Hero,
is chasing after her.

233
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,060
Crescent Ace is on the inside line.

234
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,180
At the flank, Canon Millefeuille
has her eyes on Kitasan too.

235
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,660
Behind them are It's Calling
and Read Poetry at the flank.

236
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,760
Chronicles is on the inside line.
Black Ebony is in the middle.

237
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,300
Cheval Grand is on the flank. She's here.

238
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,000
The winner of Japan Cup is here.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Behind her

240
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,340
is the winner of Takarazuka Kinen,
Satono Crown.

241
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,560
Next to her is Ribbon Training.

242
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,480
Kitasan Black…

243
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,400
I want to surpass you.

244
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,600
I will realize my dream
to win consecutively.

245
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
Even when you're gone,

246
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,780
I'll continue racing.

247
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,500
On the inside line, behind Original Shine
is Seventh Queen.

248
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,060
And then, Sounds of Earth is catching up.

249
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,920
Six Pack became the last place.

250
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,700
You can do this, Earth.

251
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,020
All the best, Earth.

252
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,580
All the best, Kitasan.

253
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,800
Approaching the third bend,

254
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,880
Kitasan Black maintains her lead.

255
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,760
What will the ones behind her do?

256
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,380
That's Kitasan's style, all right.

257
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,960
I agree.

258
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,120
Yeah.

259
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,000
She runs with all she has.

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,740
Watching her determination
somehow fills me with energy.

261
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,200
It's a simple yet awesome way of running.

262
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,840
That's Kitasan Black for you.

263
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,800
The third place on the flank,
Read Poetry,

264
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,060
speeds up.

265
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,620
Will this be a war of attrition?

266
00:13:31,660 --> 00:14:00,140
I want to win.

267
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,820
Kitasan Black is here!

268
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,380
Summoning all her willpower,

269
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,560
she creates distance
with each step she takes.

270
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,420
No, you won't!

271
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,100
Kitasan!

272
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,580
Step by step. Step by step.

273
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,820
Kitasan Black continues to accelerate.

274
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,540
-Go!
-You can do this!

275
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,520
Run!

276
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,760
Go!

277
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,340
It's so close.

278
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,000
The loud cheer at the scene
is shaking the entire racecourse.

279
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,580
-Keep it up, Kitasan!
-The loud cheer at the scene
is shaking the entire racecourse.

280
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,160
Keep it up. The finishing line is near.

281
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,420
You can do this.

282
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,800
Kita!

283
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,460
Cross the finishing line!

284
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,140
I love the way she runs!

285
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,540
So brutish yet so inspiring!

286
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,980
Like us.

287
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,180
I'm having goosebumps.

288
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,440
I hope she wins.

289
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,480
You can do this!

290
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,960
Go!

291
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Go!

292
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,560
Kitasan Black!

293
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,520
The horse girls behind her
pick up their pace.

294
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,220
Cheval Grand is in the middle.
Ribbon Training is on the flank.

295
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,140
-What?
-Wow!

296
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,460
No one can catch up to her.

297
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,120
They can't even catch her shadow.

298
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,000
Kitasan Black widens the gap between
her and everyone else.

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,340
She's leading by two horse lengths.

300
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
Go!

301
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,900
Go!

302
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,100
So this is how a megastar

303
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,860
completes her career!

304
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,720
Kitasan Black!

305
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,060
A thunderous cheer erupted
in this racecourse.

306
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,040
Everyone offers congratulations
to Kitasan Black.

307
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,340
Well done!

308
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,760
Well done, Kitasan Black!

309
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,340
Having crossed the finishing line,

310
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,420
she is met with countless
congratulations and applause.

311
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,480
All fans present congratulate
and thank her.

312
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,120
This is Kitasan Black's 7th G1 victory,

313
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,240
and also her perfect finale.

314
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you, Kitasan Black!

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,620
You're awesome, Kitasan!

316
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,680
I will do my best.
I will do my best tomorrow too!

317
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,500
Thank you, Kita!

318
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,020
What a festival…

319
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,900
Seven victories…

320
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,080
She has surpassed me as a horse girl.

321
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,640
What a talent.

322
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,380
I knew she could do it.

323
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,160
Well done, you.

324
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,640
The second place remains undetermined.
After checking the recording,

325
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,580
we hereby announce
that It's Calling was the runner-up.

326
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,920
Cheval Grand is the second runner-up.

327
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,280
Kitasan outmaneuvers her opponents
in this nail-biter

328
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,840
and won the race.

329
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,100
Crown is ranked 13th.

330
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,060
Miss Trainer.

331
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,960
Yes?

332
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,760
With the tournament next spring
as my goal,

333
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
I want to resume my training
at the beginning of next year.

334
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,800
Understood.

335
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,780
Yes, I must run.

336
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,240
Because

337
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,620
I want to see the view Kitasan has now.

338
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,940
Earth, you did your best.

339
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,380
7th place. She has done well.

340
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,700
The cheer is so loud.

341
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,500
It hypes me up too.

342
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,320
Yeah.

343
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,900
Her last race is worthy
of this thunderous applause.

344
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,220
And to be the centre
of attention like this…

345
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,200
Congratulations,

346
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,160
Kitasan.

347
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,540
Commendable.

348
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,660
Yes. As usual…

349
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,700
No.

350
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,160
I think this is her best performance yet.

351
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,280
What a shame.

352
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,380
I'm sure she can continue her career.

353
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,420
You think so?

354
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,600
Huh?

355
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Quitting at this moment is a fleeting
yet unforgettable beauty in itself.

356
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,040
I now see why you view her as your rival.

357
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,820
Yeah.

358
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,980
Kitasan!

359
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,160
-Everyone is chanting Kitasan's name.
-Kitasan.

360
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
-And she waves in response too.
