1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Heading into the slope
is No. 8, Satono Diamond.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,200
No. 3, Super Mate isn't going
to let this chance slip by either.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,720
Jewel Spinel is on the inside line

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,960
while Divinity is on the flank.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,660
200 meters left for this Japanese Derby.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,860
What a powerful acceleration.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,700
Go, Diamond, go!

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,240
You can do this, Diamond!

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,100
Get your first G1.

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,320
Super Mate bolts out from the middle.

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,760
Satono Diamond is in the lead right now.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
Alongside Super Mate, who goes
neck and neck with Satono Diamond.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,340
Super Mate has a slight edge.

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,460
Satono Diamond is slowly
losing her advantage.

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,620
Satono Diamond and Super Mate

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,360
crossed the finishing line
at the same time!

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,800
Who won? Will it be Super Mate

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,900
or No. 8, Satono Diamond?

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,020
They seemingly crossed the line together.

20
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,900
Behind them,
Divinity takes the third spot.

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,570
"RACE REPLAY"
This is…

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,755
"1ST: SUPER MATE"
It's Super Mate!

23
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,570
"2ND: SATONO DIAMOND"
It's Super Mate!

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,240
-Yay!
-Super Mate is the winner.

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,720
What a nail-biter! We needed
a replay to determine the winner.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,760
No. 8, Satono Diamond was so close behind

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,940
but she failed to secure the first spot.

28
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,800
Diamond…

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,300
The champion of this year's
Japanese Derby is Super Mate!

32
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,240
"DARING TACT"
That was so close, Diamond.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,707
"DARING TACT"
You would have won it

34
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,250
"DARING TACT"
if it weren't for your horseshoes.

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,680
What's the point of dwelling on what-ifs?

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,980
But…

37
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,100
It was only 8cm…

38
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,820
Is it the curse of Satono?

39
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,440
The curse that the Satonos
can never win G1?

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,080
I hate to say it, but everyone
can't help but think that way.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,560
The same happened back then.

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,760
And it happened to Diamond,
too, in Satsuki Sho.

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,500
It's like the higher being
is messing with us.

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,680
No.

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,380
I will break the curse.

46
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,620
I will win Kikuka Sho.

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,280
Diamond…

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,180
She doesn't give up.

49
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,920
She has a firm resolution.

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,380
Diamond is so awesome.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,340
So I should work harder too.

52
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,520
Your best record yet, Kita.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,740
Is that so?

54
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,020
Yay!

55
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,780
Your speed and stamina have improved.

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,300
It's all thanks to the intensive training.

57
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,240
Yes.

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,100
After winning Tenno Sho in spring,
you now have two victories in G1.

59
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,460
You are getting
more and more confident too.

60
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,720
You are a representative
of this generation, Kitasan.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,740
Me? For real?

62
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,200
Keep it up and win Takarazuka Kinen too.

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,300
Y... Yes!

64
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,020
Speaking of Takarazuka Kinen,
that was where I shone too.

65
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,220
As my apprentice, you have to win it.

66
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,940
Since when did you become
Kitasan's mentor?

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,820
What if Kitasan breaks the horse gate?

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
Kitasan, where are you going?

69
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm going for a jog.

70
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,620
She's still running
after a whole day of training.

71
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,740
She has bottomless stamina.

72
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,620
Yeah.

73
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,520
She overcame that wall, after all.

74
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,960
Indeed.

75
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,600
After Tenno Sho comes Takarazuka Kinen.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Will I defeat the others?

77
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,880
Hello. How are you?

78
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,400
Sorry, but where's Hanshin Racecourse?

79
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,420
Okay…

80
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,940
"YOU'RE HERE, TOKYO"
Here.

81
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,900
"HANSHIN RACECOURSE"
Here?

82
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,380
Bye.

83
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,440
Thank you so much.

84
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,680
Have I become stronger?

85
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,640
Maybe I have.

86
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,320
Recovering from her wrist fracture,
the fearsome horse girl

87
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,600
is returning to G1.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,420
Today, our special guest is Duramente,
who will take part in Takarazuka Kinen.

89
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,780
"SPECIAL PROGRAM"
Joining us is Air Groove, Duramente's

90
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,260
"DOUBLE CROWN DURAMENTE'S COMEBACK"
childhood friend and senior.

91
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,350
I will be conducting
this special interview.

92
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,360
-Duramente will race in Takarazuka Kinen?
-Woah.

93
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,800
Nine months after her injury,

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,400
Duramente won her first comeback match
in Nakayama Kinen.

95
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,680
And during the final in Dubai,

96
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,760
despite a little mishap,

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,340
Duramente still finished second
against the best European horse girls.

98
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,220
She has achieved a stellar result
in her first international race.

99
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,940
It's just second place.

100
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,060
Huh?

101
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,040
It's just second place.

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,520
Nothing to write home about.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
Uhm…

104
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,080
What she means

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,340
is that it was such an honour to learn
from the best European horse girls

106
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,320
and her performance had renewed
the confidence in her.

107
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,860
I see.

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,920
Duramente, your next race
will be Takarazuka Kinen.

109
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,220
What kind of race have you prepared
for your eager fans?

110
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,280
Absolute victory.

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,620
Is that all?

112
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,860
Absolute victory.

113
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,720
What she means

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,440
is that she hopes to show everyone
her improvements and win the race.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,640
Among all the horse girls
my mother tutored,

116
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,860
Duramente is the most promising one.

117
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,920
I am sure you will witness her coolness
in action again during Takarazuka Kinen.

118
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,000
I sure can't wait.

119
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,840
Speaking of Takarazuka Kinen,

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,240
the horse girl who has been slowly
improving in Duramente's absence,

121
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,980
Kitasan Black, will also be in it.

122
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,900
Both of them have two wins in G1,

123
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,160
so it'll be a duel between
the best of the best.

124
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,380
What do you think of it?

125
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,480
I don't care who my enemy is.

126
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,500
She means to say that Takarazuka Kinen
had a lot of talented horse girls,

127
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,960
so she wouldn't…

128
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,500
These races are the necessary steps
to Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

129
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,860
I will show everyone

130
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,400
a performance that transcends words

131
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,980
and what it means to be the absolute best.

132
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,920
Where are you going, Duramente?

133
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,480
The interview is not over.

134
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,940
I'm going back to my training, Groove.

135
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,940
Don't call me that on camera!

136
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,420
-Cut. Cut.
-Wait for me.

137
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,260
-Cut the camera.
-Did you hear

138
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,010
"PLEASE WAIT"
what she said?

139
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,480
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,420
Is that Duramente's goal?

141
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,900
How exciting.

142
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,658
What a killer interview.

143
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,840
Yeah.

144
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,520
"These races are the necessary steps
to Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe," she said.

145
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
Yeah.

146
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,560
I can understand her.

147
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,180
After all, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
is the most prestigious tournament.

148
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,460
Unless you have joined it,
you won't understand the honour.

149
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,480
You won't endure this provocation
silently, will you, Kitasan?

150
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
That's right. You can't lose
to an egoistic person like Duramente.

151
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,840
Yes. I won't lose.

152
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, I sure hope I won't lose.

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Duramente is so… strong.

154
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,420
Yeah.

155
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,780
In Satsuki Sho,
Duramente might be a bit reckless,

156
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,000
but there's more to her
than meets the eye.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,500
-Yeah.
-It feels like she unleashed everything

158
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,760
and won the Japanese Derby.

159
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,240
-Yup.
-And she missed Kikuka Sho

160
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,720
and Tenno Sho.

161
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,280
I haven't been able to defeat her.

162
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,480
The Kitasan from last year
couldn't defeat her.

163
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,260
Right?

164
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,600
That's right, Kita.

165
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
You have improved a lot.

166
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,240
-Yup.
-You are bigger now too.

167
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,200
You're not the Kitasan
from last year anymore.

168
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,440
Exactly.

169
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,520

Not bad, my dear apprentice.

When did you become her mentor?

174
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,420

They want to see the Kitasan Black
who won Kikuka Sho and Tenno Sho.

179
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,900
You.

180
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,660
Guys…

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,940
Oh, no.

182
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,440
I don't have an umbrella with me.

183
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,120
What to do…

184
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,970
UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

185
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,160
Uhm…

186
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,760
It's raining.

187
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,600
Yes.

188
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,900
I forgot to bring my umbrella.

189
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,420
Did you forget yours too, Duramente?

190
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,540
Yes.

191
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,840
So we're the same.

192
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,340
I… I watched your interview.

193
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,500
You're so amazing, Duramente.

194
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,180
You proclaimed confidently
that you want to be the absolute best.

195
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,840
Do you feel no fear?

196
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,340
What if you lost in the race

197
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,960
or couldn't meet their expectations?

198
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,220
I have never thought about that.

199
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,140
Wow.

200
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,340
Because this is my duty,

201
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,520
my distance dream,

202
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,680
my clan's instinct to constantly
push beyond my limit.

203
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,200
It's in my blood.

204
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,800
I have to challenge the mantle
of the absolute best,

205
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,140
Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

206
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,080
I was born for it.

207
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,480
That's all.

208
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,920
Even if I lose,
I won't stop marching forward.

209
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,340
I'm here to retrieve
what I forgot to bring with me.

210
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,020
I couldn't compete in Kikuka Sho.

211
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,060
Therefore…

212
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,480
I am the best horse girl
of our generation.

213
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,280
And to prove it, I'll defeat
the champion of Kikuka Sho.

214
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,280
Then, I will go beyond
and win Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

215
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,780
The determination to reach for her dream.

216
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,920
Her unwavering faith.

217
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,220
She's honest, beautiful,

218
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,660
and strong.

219
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,540
Duramente takes part in Takarazuka Kinen

220
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,300
so that she can race against me.

221
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,940
But…

222
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,200
I trained and improved a lot
in the past year too.

223
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,260
Don't go thinking
that you can defeat me that easily.

224
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,000
Who are you?

225
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,640
Huh?

226
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,480
Who are you?

227
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,220
Wait… You don't know me?

228
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,240
I don't.

229
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,320
I am Kitasan Black.

230
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,500
The Kitasan Black that won Kikuka Sho.

231
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,720
I see.

232
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,480
Duramente,

233
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,560
I will show you what I'm capable of.

234
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,720
I will defeat you so that you
will remember my name!

235
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,240
See you in Takarazuka Kinen!

236
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,920
She doesn't give a damn about me.

237
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,400
I will give my all.

238
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,700
I will show her the new version of me,

239
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,720
everything!

240
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,120
Diamond.

241
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,980
I won't let you shoulder everything alone.

242
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,160
I must break our family curse this time.

243
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,900
I'll prove it to all of you,

244
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,080
to my sister and Vivlos

245
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,660
that I can win.

246
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,240
Honouring the wishes of their loyal fans,

247
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,580
bearing everyone's dreams
on their shoulders,

248
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,900
on this wonderful day gather
17 horse girls at Hanshin Racecourse.

249
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,360
Takarazuka Kinen, the final chapter
that concludes the first half of G1

250
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,100
will begin soon.

251
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,620
Duramente and Kitasan Black.

252
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,520
This will be the duel of two
double-crowned horse girls.

253
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,220
Kitasan Black is the fans' favourite,

254
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,520
but more people cheer for Duramente here.

255
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,900
This is their first race together
after a year.

256
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,440
I can't wait to see what new things
they will bring to the table.

257
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,780
The track is slightly sticky.

258
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,680
Yeah.

259
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,520
It favours Kitasan's strength and stamina.

260
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,180
But Duramente is a beast so…

261
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,540
Don't be intimidated by her, Kitasan.

262
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,280
The festival girl, Kitasan Black.

263
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,780
And the returning champion, Duramente.

264
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,500
Who will win?

265
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,780
Takarazuka Kinen, a race that carries
the dreams of many fans

266
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,520
and the ticket to greater heights.

267
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,040
It begins now!

268
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,760
Everyone is vying for the lead.

269
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,780
Kitasan Black is off to a good start.

270
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,860
She is currently in the lead.

271
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,200
Good.

272
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,660
It is the first stretch.

273
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,540
Fans are cheering loudly
for these 17 athletes.

274
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,420
Kitasan Black!

275
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,200
-Go!
-Kita!

276
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,780
Kitasan Black is in the lead.

277
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,680
No. 4, Single Lonely,
takes the second place.

278
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,320
Then, No. 10, Canon Millefeuille.

279
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,640
No. 5, Cheval Grand.

280
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,180
Duramente is behind the centre,
right after the fourth place.

281
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,520
Behind her is Satono Crown.
We're now in the first bend.

282
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,960
Kitasan is accelerating while Duramente
preserves her energy for the final sprint.

283
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,800
They use two different approaches.

284
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,140
The current first place, Kitasan Black,
is leading by two horse lengths.

285
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,180
After the second bend, she will head
into another stretch.

286
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,020
No. 4, Single Lonely,
takes the second place.

287
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,540
Then, No. 10, Canon Millefeuille.

288
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,900
No. 11, South Fox is on the flank,
alongside Cheval Grand.

289
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,840
Behind them

290
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,620
is the ambitious beast, Duramente.

291
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,660
Satono Crown is giving chase too.

292
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,420
The record for the first 1,000 meters
is 59.1 seconds.

293
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,600
Not even one minute.

294
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
She's too fast.

295
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,240
Yes.

296
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,360
But I'm sure Kitasan will persevere
till the end.

297
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,420
Can Kitasan Black keep this up
in the latter half of the race?

298
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,660
In Derby, I only looked at
what was in front of me.

299
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,580
But now, I can hear
the footsteps behind me,

300
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,940
including Duramente's.

301
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,240
Kitasan Black is leading
by 1.5 horse length.

302
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,700
But No. 16, River Light, accelerated
at the fourth bend.

303
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,200
Duramente is still at the centre.

304
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,220
My breathing is stable.
My feet are light.

305
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,120
I will show her what I can do
and win this race.

306
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,680
-Now!
-Let's do this.

307
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,920
Leaving the final bend,
they have arrived at the home stretch.

308
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,400
Kitasan Black is leading
by two horse lengths.

309
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,440
The second place is No. 7, Bravo Day.

310
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,140
River Light is on the flank

311
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,400
with Cheval Grand.

312
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,940
Satono Crown speeds up on the flank.

313
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,340
-Go!
-Kita!

314
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,900
Keep this up.

315
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,360
200 meters left.

316
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,020
They are heading to the slope.

317
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,600
And right then,

318
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,820
Duramente dashes out from the centre
for the first place.

319
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,240
She is out!

320
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,440
I will cross the finishing line like this.

321
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,420
Duramente!

322
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,300
Can she close the gap? Duramente!

323
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,880
Kitasan Black is still in the lead.

324
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
So fast.

325
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,280
But I will overtake you.

326
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
Kitasan Black is in the lead,

327
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,060
but here comes Duramente!

328
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,080
I will show you that I'm the strongest.

329
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,400
Who are you?

330
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,480
No. 2, River Light, closes in too.

331
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,340
River Light!

332
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,940
The winner is neither
the festival girl nor the beast,

333
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,120
it's River Light!

334
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,940
Overtaking Kitasan Black
from the inside line

335
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,640
and Duramente on the flank,

336
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,040
the winner of this tournament

337
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,820
is No. 16, River Light!

338
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,460
Yay!

339
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,280
I lost again.

340
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,000
Duramente!

341
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,600
Duramente, are you all right?

342
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,820
Let's head to the infirmary now.

343
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,780
No need.

344
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,600
-But…
-I said, no need.

345
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,680
Duramente, you are amazing.

346
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
You overtook me again.

347
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,640
I lost.

348
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,860
Yay!

349
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,580
You are not too shabby either.

350
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,480
You forced me to run
like I have never run before.

351
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,520
You will now be my checkpoint.

352
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,040
That is your purpose.

353
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,680
I am honoured to race with you here.

354
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,080
I will become stronger.

355
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,380
And next time, I will personally hand
your defeat to you,

No.

362
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,840
