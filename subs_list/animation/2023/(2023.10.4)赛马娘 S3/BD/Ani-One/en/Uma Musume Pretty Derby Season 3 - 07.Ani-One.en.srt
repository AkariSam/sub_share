1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,320
Kitasan Black is in the lead now.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,620
She's still maintaining her lead
on the slope.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,920
200 meters left.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,260
Opheryu is following closely behind.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,160
-So is Sounds of Earth.
-Go!

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,380
Kitasan Black is not giving her lead up.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,840
Sounds of Earth takes the second spot.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,100
Sounds of Earth!

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,400
The 3rd place, Cheval Grand,
closes the gap too.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,780
But Kitasan Black is too far ahead.

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,960
Kitasan Black!

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,060
She did it!

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,500
I did it. I did it!

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,800
-Kita!
-Congratulations!

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,900
What a thrilling race!

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,980
Second place in G1. Well done!

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,340
Not bad at all.

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,400
Right? She's amazing.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,700
Right…

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm running out of things
to teach her.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,660
Third place…

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,500
VERXINA, VIVLOS

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,460
I did it.

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,660
Yes. You worked so hard for it.

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,360
Three wins in G1.
And it's Japan Cup to boot.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,320
Not bad. You won first place
in the biggest event of the year.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,480
Arima Kinen is next.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,620
I will have my revenge!

EPISODE 7: OUR ARIMA KINEN

31
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,530
Who did you vote for in Arima Kinen?

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,530
"ARIMA KINEN FAN VOTING"
I voted for Kitasan Black and Cheval Grand.

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,200
They are the veterans.

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,920
But for the Classics,
it has to be Satono Diamond.

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,140
She performed so well in Kikuka Sho.

36
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,720
She has it in her.
She just needed the stars to align.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,740
They are strong enough to represent
the current generation.

38
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,020
I can't wait to watch their duel.

39
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,600
Third place in Japan Cup.
You were so close.

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,020
But you did so well too.

41
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,220
Congratulations.

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,920
Oh… Thank you.

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,500
It's been a while since we
last hung out like this together.

44
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,040
You weren't there for my previous
celebration party too, Cheval.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,080
Sorry, I was busy.

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,460
Eh? I see.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,280
You did win

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Triple Tiara's Shuka Sho.
So well done to you too, Vivlos.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,540
Gentildonna always outruns me.

50
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,820
Unlike you who can never score
above second place.

51
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,860
Hey. Watch your mouth.

52
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Cheval, are you participating
in Arima Kinen?

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,140
I guess.

54
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,100
Then, win your first G1 in Arima Kinen.

55
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,620
It'd be great if all three of us
could become horse girls in G1.

56
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,200
Mhm.

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,680
-Let's eat something good before training.
-Only the runners-up race in Triple Tiara.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,300
-Sure.
-Verxina reigns in Victoria Mile.

59
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,913
-Wow.
-And Vivlos had already

60
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,780
-Wow.
-won a G1 before I did.

61
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,620
I'm the only one who hasn't…

62
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,920
-Cheval, if you won't eat it, I'll…
-I can't lose anymore.

63
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,790
"FUKUNAGA COMMERCIAL STREET"
There you go.

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,340
There you go.

65
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,840
Thank you for your help again, Kita.

66
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,380
We shouldn't ask a horse girl who won
G1 thrice to do this anymore.

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,320
It's okay. I don't mind it.

68
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,280
Congratulations Kita,
on winning Japan Cup.

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,660
Thank you.

70
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,820
I voted for you in the fan-voting contest.

71
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,280
Do your best in Arima Kinen.

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,680
I will. I can't wait to run with Diamond.

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,960
We'll be there to cheer for you.

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,800
I, for one, can't wait to watch
the post-race concert.

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,360
Whether I win or lose…

76
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,340
No.

77
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,920
I won't lose.

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,260
I will make sure to give my best
performance on live!

79
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:15,140
Go, Kita, the festival girl.

80
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,500
-All right.
-Go, Kita, the festival girl.

81
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,710
-I won't let you down.
-Go, Kita, the festival girl.

82
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,460
FINISH LINE

83
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,400
Kita is in great shape.

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,460
Mhm.

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,080
She'll put on a better performance
than last year's in Arima Kinen.

86
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,180
I can't wait.

87
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,200
Kitasan will be a tough foe to beat.

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
Yes.

89
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,160
Done.

90
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,140
Kita!

91
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,120
Do you have any plans later?

92
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,200
No.

93
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,220
Do you want to hang out with me?

94
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,540
-Delicious!
-So delicious.

95
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,980
You're in a great mood today.

96
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,660
Yes, I feel good about myself.

97
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,400
I can't wait

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,940
to race alongside Diamond in Arima Kinen.

99
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,440
I see.

100
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,520
It's all because of you, Teio.

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,620
Me?

102
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,720
Yes.

103
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,820
That was an unforgettable Arima Kinen.

104
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,360
It was memorable.

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,680
Everyone watched you

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,200
cross the finishing line.

107
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,300
You were like a shooting star.

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,220
I lived through

109
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,580
that moment,

110
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,400
the moment a star was born,
cheered by everyone else like my dad.

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,720
It was dazzling. Surreal.

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,260
It's a scene I'll never forget.

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,920
So I vow

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,080
to one day

115
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,200
race in this grand stage.

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,840
I will do my best

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,720
and bring everyone a race
as memorable as that day.

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,560
Diamond and I grew up together.

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,000
We always let each other have the last
piece of food. Or we just share it.

120
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,500
But the first place of Arima Kinen…

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,720
I can't let her have it.
Nor can we share it.

122
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,640
I had a bad run in Arima Kinen last year.

123
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,700
And in the past year,

124
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,300
I've been working really hard
to improve myself.

125
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,800
I've never defeated Diamond in a match,

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,500
be it running or rope skipping.

127
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,920
But not this time. This time,

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,620
I'll win.

129
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,940
You're all set then.

130
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,120
Huh?

131
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Sometimes,
the better you feel about yourself,

132
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,320
the more disappointed you'll be.
Because you get carried away.

133
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,280
Teio…

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,700
Do your best, Kita.

135
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,740
All right.

136
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,120
If I win in Arima Kinen,

137
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,120
I can perhaps be
the Horse Girl of the Year.

138
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,200
Eh…

139
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,780
I'm getting carried away, aren't I?

140
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,010
HONG KONG G1 VICTORY CELEBRATORY BANQUET

141
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,960
Who would have thought that you
would bag your first G1 overseas?

142
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,140
Right?

143
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,260
But

144
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,720
it wasn't until I won my first race

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,160
that I realized the burden and joy
of winning G1.

146
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,360
Crown…

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
It's all thanks to you, Diamond.

148
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,120
You broke our family curse
during Kikuka Sho.

149
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,700
Well…

150
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,480
The other Satonos
are in great spirits lately.

151
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,280
I think it's because you just became the
new ceiling they want to break through.

152
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,020
We have to hurry up
and break the ceiling then.

153
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,620
But thank you truly, Diamond.

154
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,160
Your performance in Kikuka Sho
rekindled my spirit.

155
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,620
Not at all, Crown.

156
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,740
You took the words out of my mouth.

157
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,160
I can't lose this time.

158
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,500
Next year, I want to challenge the world.

159
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,820
Therefore, in the upcoming Arima Kinen,

160
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,480
I must defeat her.

161
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,580
Kitasan, you mean?

162
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,020
It's a shared promise
between you two, isn't it?

163
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,840
To one day
participate in Arima Kinen together.

164
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,900
The promise is important to me.

165
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,080
But

166
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,560
I need to defeat
who I think is the strongest now

167
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,480
and become the best horse girl in Japan.

168
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,020
I will represent Japan in tournaments

169
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,280
and bring our family this honour.

170
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,720
It's my goal.

171
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,680
Diamond…

UMA MUSUME PRETTY DERBY SEASON 3

173
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
Earth, you're doing great.

174
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,620
Easy-peasy.

175
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,340
How confident are you for Arima Kinen?

176
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,320
Very confident, Mademoiselle Nature.

177
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,820
Heed my words. I will

178
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,780
deliver a jaw-dropping performance
like Golden Ship did last time.

179
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,260
Golden Ship was ranked 8th last year.

180
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,440
That's not good.

181
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,700
How valiant!

182
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,680
I don't understand what she said

183
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,620
but there's no denying her confidence.

184
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,580
Kitasan Black!

185
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,840
This is her fourth G1.
And she's giving her all.

186
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,260
Yes. She's very strong.

187
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,540
As expected from a horse girl
personally acknowledged by Turbo.

188
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,100
Her growth has been spectacular
since spring.

189
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,900
Mhm.

190
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,640
Miss Nature.

191
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,180
Give me another lesson
when you have the time.

192
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,540
Another lesson?

193
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,620
-She's…
-She teaches Kitasan Black?

194
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,800
Wow.

195
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,920
Did she just say that you're her teacher?

196
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,780
Colour me surprised.

197
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,040
Sheesh. Kitasan outdid herself again.

198
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,540
This will be our match, Diamond.

199
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,060
This will be our match, Kita.

200
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,900
You, who always follow behind me.

201
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,780
You, who always hold my hands

202
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,460
as we visit different places.

203
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,180
Diamond is strong, beautiful, and elegant.

204
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,240
And so…

205
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,800
The stage is ready, Kita.

206
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,420
I will win.

207
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
The winner will be me.

208
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,020
Uhm… Are you awake?

209
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,120
Yes, I am.

210
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,800
I want to sleep but I can't.

211
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,020
It feels like the night
before a school trip.

212
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,660
Speaking of school trips, when I
toppled my lunch box,

213
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,540
you shared your lunch with me.

214
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,620
Did I?

215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,160
But we can't share the first place.

216
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,240
Yeah.

217
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,600
Diamond.

218
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,200
I have always thought
that you are an amazing person.

219
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,160
Whenever I do something,

220
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,560
you always manage
to catch up to me easily.

221
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,580
You're so bright.

222
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,280
You're like my younger sister
but you're smart and so capable.

223
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,640
I really can't wait to race against you.

224
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,240
Me too.

225
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,420
Kita, you always work so hard.

226
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,700
You never give up and you face
everything with a smile.

227
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,760
You lift us up.

228
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
And I think that's incredible.

229
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,200
Diamond…

230
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,500
We should sleep now.

231
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Goodnight.

232
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,040
Goodnight.

233
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,200
Diamond!

234
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,180
Ah, it was just a dream.

235
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,640
What time is it now?

236
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,320
Phew.

237
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,240
Eh?

238
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,900
Diamond?

239
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,690
I'M OFF.
-DIAMOND

240
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,760
I see.

241
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,080
Our race has already begun,
right, Diamond?

242
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,700
All right then.

243
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,120
So cold!

244
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:23,420
In this wintry Nakayama Racecourse,
all horse girls are fired up.

245
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,680
The annual Arima Kinen is about to begin.

246
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,540
I am excited.

247
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,280
What spectacular moments can we expect
in this year-end grand event?

248
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,000
There's a huge crowd today.

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,300
It's December but I can feel the heat.

250
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,800
Right?

251
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,260
Today is the day.

252
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,200
They are here.

253
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,940
Kitasan Black is voted
as the fan's favourite

254
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,080
but more people cheer for
Satono Diamond today.

255
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,680
Who are you supporting?

256
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
You already know the answer.

257
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,910
SATONO DIAMOND, KITASAN BLACK

258
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,840
We think alike.

259
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,260
As expected, these two are the most
anticipated horse girls.

260
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,380
Yes.

261
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,980
Will Satono Diamond, who grabbed
her first G1 win in Kikuka Sho

262
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,160
and who has the most fans
in the Classics, win?

263
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,440
Or will it be Kitasan Black,
who has also won Kikuka Sho

264
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,920
and who now has three G1 wins
under her belt?

265
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,860
This end-of-year grand prix…

266
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,840
I'm as ready as G-sharp.

267
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,360
I cannot underperform

268
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,980
before them.

269
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,920
Never.

270
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,700
The race will begin soon.

271
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,960
Diamond.

272
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Diamond, we will…

273
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,520
We will race with all our might

274
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
and settle the score.

275
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,560
I will defeat you,

276
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,240
Kitasan Black.

277
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,780
Diamond is very focused.

278
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,000
I cannot lose to her.

279
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,420
I wonder, what does 100,000 fans

280
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,100
sound like to those horse girls
at the starting line?

281
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,880
All runners are in position.

282
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
What race awaits us today?
What will we witness?

283
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,660
Arima Kinen.

284
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,400
And they're off!

285
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,860
Kitasan Black is off to a good start
on the inside line.

286
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,320
Next to her is Opheryu.

287
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,840
Go!

288
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,480
The one in the lead is Read Fantasy.

289
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,460
Kitasan Black is right behind her.

290
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,680
Satono Diamond is middle of the pack.

291
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,760
Green Uniform is running
as fast as possible too.

292
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,560
The cheers of 100,000 fans
will welcome these horse girls soon.

293
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,020
After the fourth bend of the first lap,
they arrive at the stretch.

294
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,700
Read Fantasy is still in the lead.

295
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,560
Kitasan Black takes the second spot.

296
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,940
Behind her are Opheryu and Great House.

297
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,340
What a thunderous sound.

298
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,000
That's Arima Kinen for you.

299
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,180
Mhm.

300
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,240
Not bad.

301
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,520
But don't get impatient, Kitasan.

302
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,680
The race stabilizes after the first bend.

303
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,740
The time record for the first
1,000-meter lap is 61 seconds.

304
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,340
Read Fantasy continues
to maintain her lead.

305
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,200
No. 1, Kitasan Black,

306
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,840
is six to seven lengths behind her.

307
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,140
Am I too fast?

308
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,080
No, I should be able to handle
this speed with my current stamina.

309
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,620
Transfixed by Kitasan Black,
Satono Diamond takes the third spot.

310
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,360
The runner-up from the previous year,

311
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,560
No. 6, Sounds of Earth, is here too.

312
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,900
-Earth!
-No. 6, Sounds of Earth, is here too.

313
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,680
No. 14, Cheval Grand, closes the gap too.

314
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,140
Go!

315
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,340
They are heading to the third bend.
600 meters left for this race.

316
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,980
I can do this. I can do this.

317
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,320
Charge!

318
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,240
Read Fantasy's lead is almost all gone.

319
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,720
Kitasan Black is half a horse length
behind her.

320
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,780
She slowly overtakes her.

321
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,420
She plans to accelerate?

322
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,600
Not bad.

323
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,760
-Overtake her.
-Go!

324
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,540
All the best, Kita.

325
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,900
After the fourth bend, they are now
at the final stretch.

326
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,920
The cheers from 100,000 fans
rock through Nakayama Racecourse.

327
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,560
Is this the end for Read Fantasy?

328
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,080
Kitasan Black continues to accelerate.

329
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,300
Opheryu gives chase.

330
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,620
Then, it's Satono Diamond.

331
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,260
Cheval Grand closes in too.

332
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,980
These popular horse girls
bolted to the front.

333
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,020
I can see the finishing line.

334
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,440
Kitasan Black braces herself

335
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,360
and goes for the final sprint.

336
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,020
-Go!
-and goes for the final sprint.

337
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,240
Will she turn this race
into a festival about her victory?

338
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,700
However, she cannot widen the gap.

339
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,960
The ones at the front will not give up.

340
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,500
How long can Kitasan Black
maintain her lead?

341
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,560
Satono Diamond appears.

342
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,200
She's here, but…

343
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,780
Kitasan Black continues to accelerate.

344
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,220
This is it.

345
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,500
You always outrun me,

346
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,860
but not today.

347
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
Satono Diamond approaches.

348
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,020
Kitasan Black speeds up again,
but Opheryu has given up yet.

349
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,940
Satono Diamond continues to close in.

350
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,040
It's a race between the three
most popular horse girls.

351
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,300
Keep it steady.

352
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,480
I must run faster.

353
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,800
Keep it steady.

354
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,620
I must run faster.

355
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,800
Has she done it? Has she overtaken her?

356
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,120
She did! With a tiny margin!

357
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,700
Satono Diamond!

358
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,280
Satono Diamond won this race.

359
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,880
She showed the veterans
what she is capable of.

360
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,380
Eighth place?

361
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,060
I like the sound of it.

362
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,280
Eighth place! You did so well!

363
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,100
Congratulations, Diamond.

364
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,800
Thank you, Kita.

365
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,800
You're so strong.

366
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,580
So very strong.

367
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,880
You're very strong too, Kita.

368
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,920
Well, I still can't outrun you.

369
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,620
You tested my limit too.

370
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,900
I'm so used to chasing after you.

371
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,900
I see.

372
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,160
Do your best in the concert too.

373
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,100
I promised my friends that
I would give them the best performance.

374
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,140
Sure.

375
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,660
It's our first time
on the same stage together, Diamond.

376
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,040
Yeah. I'm a little bit nervous.

377
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,260
Me too.

378
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,900
When this happens, you can
write the character, festival, on your…

379
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,180
Kita, it's about to begin.

380
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,460
Right.

381
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,700
Even though I enjoyed the race,

382
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,640
she is still ahead of me.
