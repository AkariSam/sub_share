1
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:14,664
Are you awake, Akagami?

2
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,052
I feel as if I've died and reborn.

3
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:20,043
Reborn?

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,161
I'm feeling fresh

5
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,465
and fearless now.

6
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:26,449
Don't push yourself too hard.

7
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,279
Kiki and I are going out for a bit,

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,353
Mia and Kagura are already up.

9
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:33,815
Aren't you scared?

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,894
Good morning, Akagami.

11
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,326
Good morning, Miss Mia.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,980
Where are the others?

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,110
Tsukuyo and Kurage are still sleeping,

14
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:45,426
Kagura is working on
her computer in her room.

15
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,467
Kagura.

16
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:56,193
Kagura.

17
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:01,595
Akagami Kagura Harmony Project.

18
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,533
What do you want from me all of a sudden?

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,272
I'm okay with anything but kissing.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,776
I don't understand what you're saying.

21
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,981
Akagami is very afraid of you.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,444
Oh dear.

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,801
It seems like he's suffered some

24
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,604
severe psychological trauma.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,884
Oops, I kicked too hard.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,380
If my friends and comrades aren't getting
along, I can't sit back and do nothing.

27
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:24,825
I want you two to be as close

28
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:26,771
as Akagami and I are.

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,020
Isn't that a bit of a stretch?

30
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,150
Why don't you two

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,875
share your impressions
of each other first?

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,916
Akagami, how do you feel
when you see Kagura?

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,616
Um… I get pains in my crotch.

34
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,581
That's a blatant sexual harassment.

35
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,689
This is a positive impression, Kagura.

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,396
It's clearly a case of sexual harassment
that could be taken to court.

37
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:48,193
Kagura, what do you think of Akagami?

38
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,636
Mr. Akagami is a good man.

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,996
Yes.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,608
Exactly.

41
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,527
Akagami is a very impressive person.

42
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:00,769
Not really.

43
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,564
He's both serious and honest,

44
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,444
which is why he has to be kicked out.

45
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:09,131
Really, you both have
pretty good impressions of each other.

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,924
Let's move on to the final stage then.

47
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,223
You two will stay in the warehouse
until tomorrow morning.

48
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,064
But it's morning now.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,488
It was here that Akagami
and I cleared up our misunderstandings.

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,342
You two will definitely do well.

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,002
I'll have Twister ready by tonight.

52
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,363
Miss Mia.

53
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,644
We've been set up.

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,016
I can't believe my plan
has backfired on myself.

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,124
Indeed.

56
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,275
But luckily she didn't make me play

57
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,591
the Hyakunin Isshu I casually taught her.

58
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,275
Was that your doing as well?

59
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:50,039
Did Miss Mia get all of her
outrageous knowledge from her?

60
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:51,669
Oh, right.

61
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,542
If you harass me here,

62
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:01,869
I could easily get
you kicked out of the temple.

63
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,410
Why didn't you tell Mia about my plan?

64
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,030
If you expose me, maybe I'll be cornered.

65
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,253
I wouldn't do that.

66
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,441
I don't wish to be
your enemy, Lord Kagura.

67
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,101
Lord?

68
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:22,672
The best thing is for us to get along.

69
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,840
I want to cherish the…
connection between us.

70
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,668
What are you trying to do,
buttering me up?

71
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,358
I'm not.

72
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,172
And you're keeping your distance from me.

73
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,646
I'm sorry. It's an involuntary reaction.

74
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:43,325
You should be buttering up Mia instead.

75
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:46,419
Then take responsibility properly,
and everything will be fine.

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,676
Oh? Oh dear?

77
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,496
What's wrong?

78
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,919
Nothing. Nothing at all.

79
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:57,058
She kicked it open.

80
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:59,298
This is the principle of leverage.

81
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,356
You clearly just kicked it.

82
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,537
Why didn't I notice it earlier?

83
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,185
TAKE THIS
I can take him away.

84
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,401
AND LIKE THIS
I can get Akagami and Mia together,

85
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:14,235
and then take him
to Christoph's house later.

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,349
Akagami, let's get along.

87
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,773
WORLDLY DESIRES

88
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,069
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

89
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,163
(Episode 10: It's Just That I'm a Little Horny)

90
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,306
W-Wait a moment, Akagami.

91
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,108
Although we've kissed once before,

92
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,747
I didn't mean to…

93
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,269
I've already said 'no.'

94
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,870
Please, Akagami.

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,716
At least…

96
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:15,147
be gentle with me.

97
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,969
No.

98
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,133
Good morning, Sis Tsukuyo.

99
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,805
Good morning, Kurage.

100
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,748
Let me go first.

101
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:45,343
Hmm.

102
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:48,223
Please. I'll buy you a chocolate sundae
if you keep my secret.

103
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,688
I want a large one.

104
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:51,993
Alright.

105
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,974
How could I have such a dream?

106
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,198
Is it because I'm horny?

107
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,474
Miss Tsukuyo.

108
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,930
Good morning.

109
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:10,557
Morning.

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,376
Alright, let's make breakfast.

111
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
You look pretty relaxed.

112
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:17,759
It's all because we kissed once

113
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,283
that I had such a dream.

114
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,948
But that was an accident.

115
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,828
And it's all in the past now.

116
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,233
Akagami.

117
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,146
What's on the menu today?

118
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,503
Breakfast will consist of grilled fish.

119
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,047
Grilled fish.

120
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,227
By the way,

121
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,432
Alright.

122
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,987
when did those two

123
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,206
become so close?

124
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:46,855
APPLE JUICE
That's really bothering me.

125
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,724
Do you walk silently, Kagura?

126
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,370
I think this might be an opportunity.

127
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,899
Camera?

128
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,331
Akagami, it's too tight.

129
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,260
Slow down a bit.

130
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,582
Where are we going, Miss Mia?

131
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,092
This is a kind of practice
called Twister.

132
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,052
Why are you showing me
a pornographic video?

133
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,257
Was that Akagami and Mia?

134
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,302
Yes, would you like to watch it again?

135
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,050
No!

136
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,886
They were glowing.

137
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,598
Did the two of them do it?

138
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,142
No, no. At first,

139
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,133
Mia really didn't like Akagami.

140
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,132
SOY SAUCE
Oh.

141
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,308
I'm sorry, Akagami.

142
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,256
I tripped.

143
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,311
Are you alright, Miss Mia?

144
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,452
It's okay.

145
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,166
It's just that I'm a little horny.

146
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:58,217
Mia is definitely falling for him.

147
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:00,521
And she even admitted to being horny.

148
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,444
Let's start gathering evidence now.

149
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:08,164
I'm the secretary, Kagura.

150
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
What's happened?

151
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you sure we don't need
to call Akagami over?

152
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,093
No need, I don't want to see him now.

153
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,845
Speaking of, Kagura,
are you interested in this matter?

154
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,970
I want to record
everything related to Mia.

155
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,114
Is that so? Well, do as you please.

156
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,737
There are reports that indecent activities
have taken place in this temple.

157
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,879
And you, Mia, are the main suspect.

158
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,597
I can't pretend I didn't hear that!

159
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:40,911
I've never done anything
against my conscience.

160
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,536
So you're capable
of answering any question?

161
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:45,955
Of course.

162
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,312
Really? Then I have a question.

163
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,018
Mia, do you like Akagami?

164
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,542
-Uh… I wouldn't say so.
-What?

165
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,542
Why did you suddenly ask that?

166
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:11,927
Well.

167
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,546
But you two have been
getting closer and closer.

168
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,962
Ah! I see.

169
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:20,721
We're practice partners,
so of course we get along.

170
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,942
In that sense, I guess I do like him.

171
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,818
Oh.

172
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,570
P-Partners?

173
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,132
At first, we did
have misunderstandings and conflicts.

174
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,500
But we've made up now.

175
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,394
I see.

176
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,851
So it was a misunderstanding.

177
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,974
Also,

178
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,830
Akagami is the world's most handsome man.

179
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:45,493
In fact, I came to Japan
to develop my heart.

180
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,566
I've decided to eliminate
my own distractions.

181
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,150
So Akagami is a very ideal partner.

182
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,743
Having such a handsome man by my side

183
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
constantly stirs up
my distracting thoughts.

184
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,616
Every day, I'm flipped and horny.

185
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:03,539
I felt destiny in this encounter.

186
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,798
If possible, I'd even want
to spend my lifetime with him.

187
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,047
The investigation continues.

188
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:13,839
What's wrong now?

189
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,144
Kagura! Why did you tie me up? Kagura!

190
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,066
An encounter with destiny?
Spending a lifetime together?

191
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,239
This is

192
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:24,574
not as simple as liking someone!

193
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,706
Does Akagami know her thoughts?
So he took advantage of her vulnerability.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,728
But… but…

195
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,949
He did this and that to me, too.

196
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:35,377
And…

197
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:37,827
I just want

198
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:42,102
to make Miss Tsukuyo happy.

199
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,277
Hasn't he said something like this?

200
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:46,721
Huh?

201
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,985
Miss Tsukuyo, why is your face so red?

202
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,173
A-Are you that angry?

203
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,690
It's not like that!

204
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,557
I'm not angry at all.

205
00:11:56,557 --> 00:12:00,077
Well, that's me being rude.

206
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,719
I thought

207
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,457
you would definitely

208
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,349
be very jealous.

209
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,982
I have absolutely
no feelings for Akagami…

210
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:13,042
Did someone call me?

211
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,314
You guys seem to be having a lot of fun.

212
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,144
Akagami.

213
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:27,321
Miss Mia.

214
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,689
What are you playing at?

215
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:32,515
Miss Tsukuyo, what's going on?

216
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,043
Miss Tsukuyo?

217
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,878
Your face is all red.

218
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,862
What's going on?

219
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,181
Don't look… at me.

220
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,185
Did you do something you're ashamed of?

221
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,505
Do you want to try it, Akagami?

222
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,724
Please. Whoa!

223
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,519
Akagami!

224
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:56,217
If that's the case,
I'll confront him with the video.

225
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,890
Kagura! Hand me that evidence!

226
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:00,255
Okay.

227
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,049
Huh? Where did the camera go?

228
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,258
Uh, is this camera yours, Miss Kagura?

229
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,861
Kurage!

230
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,841
This is bad.
That video is too pornographic.

231
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:12,789
Don't play it!

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,088
Play?

233
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,937
I've said not to play it!

234
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,817
Absolutely do not watch!

235
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,681
They seem to be panting.

236
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:23,812
Listen to me, Kurage!

237
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,505
Innocent sister

238
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,513
witnessing such indecent behavior.

239
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,221
It seems this game is very interesting.

240
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,766
What is that?

241
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:37,187
Oh, this is when we have fun
at the warehouse.

242
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,150
So it was recorded.

243
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,841
Game?

244
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,315
Look at the mat on the ground.

245
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:52,369
What? I thought…

246
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:53,613
You thought?

247
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:56,069
You thought?

248
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,537
What type of video did you think it was?

249
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,134
I'll buy you a strawberry sundae,
just don't ask.

250
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,196
Why?

251
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,792
SNEAK AROUND, WITH EVIL INTENTION

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,728
No money!

253
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,481
The temple has more expenses
than income during the New Year period,

254
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,128
and there is almost
no incense money from worshippers.

255
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,488
If this continues,

256
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,282
where will the funds for
Buddha's repairs come from?

257
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:36,163
No. No, I can't be disheartened.

258
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,832
Let's start doing what I can do.

259
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,224
Firstly, save some food and such.

260
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,270
Ah!

261
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,227
What happened, Akagami?

262
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,128
I heard a princess-like scream!

263
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:56,674
Rice… rice…

264
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,719
There is no more rice!

265
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:01,083
What did you say?

266
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:04,625
If there's no more rice,
just go and buy some.

267
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,308
That's easier said than done,

268
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,375
but there's no money.

269
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,743
Oh, that's the case.

270
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:15,076
But don't worry, Akagami.

271
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,010
Japan has something
called a yearly tribute, right?

272
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:21,333
Through this method, the temple
can get rice for free.

273
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,896
Miss Mia, what you're talking about
isn't modern Japan.

274
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,456
What's wrong with you, Akagami?

275
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,603
I heard a princess-like scream.

276
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,886
Miss Yuzuki, actually the rice is already…

277
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:35,093
Finally finished?

278
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:36,550
So,

279
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,073
let's go collect the yearly tribute.

280
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,469
Seriously?

281
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,764
Other temples do this too.

282
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,644
There are a few properties
under the name of Mikazuki Temple.

283
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:52,065
We collect a certain amount
of rice as a yearly tribute

284
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:54,433
from the people who use that land.

285
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:57,085
So it's something like rent?

286
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,557
Roughly like that.

287
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,619
Why is it still a yearly tribute
and not money?

288
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,506
Because the temple's business
is essentially not for making money.

289
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:07,681
After all, the yearly tribute
is just the goodwill of the parishioner.

290
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,641
I see.

291
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,976
You're not even close
to learning, Akagami.

292
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,295
It's so frustrating.

293
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,658
But,

294
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:20,201
is it really okay for us to go with you?

295
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:21,875
Won't it seem a bit impolite?

296
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,550
Of course, it's okay.

297
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,274
And rice is heavy, so I need help.

298
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:28,609
And visiting parishioners is also

299
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,353
part of the practice.

300
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,434
Practice?

301
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,502
The fourth component
of enlightenment is to cherish

302
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,336
and appreciate all of one's destinies
in the present moment.

303
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
All things are connected by destiny.

304
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,726
There is not a single thing
that is meaningless.

305
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:45,607
DESTINY. KARMA. CONNECTION.

306
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,217
Mia, your visit to Mikazuki Temple

307
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,542
and Akagami's employment here

308
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,059
are not coincidental occurrences.

309
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:55,557
-This…
-Indeed.

310
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,326
Destinies are crucial.

311
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,822
We have to be grateful for them every day.

312
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,062
Because of various destiny,

313
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,988
the people we are about to meet
became Mikazuki Temple devotees.

314
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,125
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
So,

315
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:10,265
what kind of people are our temples for?

316
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,414
We will get to know them well.

317
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,654
Alright.

318
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:18,426
Then let us confirm
and express our heartfelt gratitude!

319
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:22,841
I have no rice at home,
go back where you came from.

320
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,543
Get lost.

321
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,819
-Miss Yuzuki?
-Let's go to the next house.

322
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,036
Isn't it funny that you're still
collecting tribute these days?

323
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:43,234
Grampy, please give us some rice.

324
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,936
The yearly tributes.

325
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,441
If you clean for me, I'll give you some.

326
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:54,500
Why are we cleaning?
Is this also a destiny?

327
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,063
Haha.

328
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,973
The closet is too full.
It can't hold anymore!

329
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:02,933
What's all this about?

330
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,259
In the end, we didn't get any rice.

331
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,886
Well,

332
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:10,353
the yearly tribute was originally sent
voluntarily by parishioners each year.

333
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:14,757
Those we visited today have been delaying
the yearly tributes for various reasons.

334
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,360
Does that mean
they also have difficulties?

335
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:20,497
Uh… sort of.

336
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,140
Next house!
The next house is the last one.

337
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,103
Cheer up and let's go.

338
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:30,575
Welcome, Yuzuki. Thank you
for coming all the way out here.

339
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,804
We're sorry to bother you.

340
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,810
No problem at all.

341
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,620
This is my first time seeing you two.

342
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,922
Thanks for coming all this way.
I accidentally broke my leg.

343
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,259
The rice is in the yard.

344
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,894
Take as much as you want.

345
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,516
Lady Buddha!

346
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,965
What? Am I that beautiful?

347
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,518
Your children are so cute.

348
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,247
Mom.

349
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:57,577
Do we have guests?

350
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,826
Ah! It's Sis Yuzuki.

351
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,391
Yo.

352
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,889
So cute.

353
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:04,483
Welcome.

354
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,495
Oh, do you want to play a game?

355
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,730
Wow!

356
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:10,696
Don't mess around, she is very busy.

357
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:11,679
Then,

358
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:13,421
show us your breasts!

359
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:14,493
Dream on.

360
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,981
-They're always so annoying.
-Breasts!

361
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,425
Sorry. These two brats are
far too obsessed with breasts.

362
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:21,599
Breasts!

363
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,984
Why are they so eager to see breasts?

364
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,920
They must really want to see…

365
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,224
Akagami!

366
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:31,530
Why are my thoughts on par
with the children's?

367
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,437
This is not a good thing, kids!

368
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,471
If you keep doing this, you will not be
able to become outstanding adults.

369
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,437
Only by overcoming one's own desires

370
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:44,837
can one mature properly.

371
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:46,107
Is that so?

372
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,347
I got it, sis.

373
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:49,719
It's great that you got it.

374
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,044
So,

375
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,203
show us the breasts
of an outstanding adult.

376
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:54,970
How did it come to this?

377
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,969
Show us.

378
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,198
Oh no, this is bad.

379
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,800
You're Akagami, right?

380
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,564
Yuzuki has mentioned you.

381
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:07,933
I apologize for not greeting you sooner.
My name is Akagami.

382
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,894
Nice to meet you.

383
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,158
Sorry for the sudden commotion.

384
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,144
It's fine. You are already far
superior to the other parishioners.

385
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,175
Do they all have bad attitudes?

386
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:22,279
Honestly, I want to cut ties with them.

387
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,130
You're quite interesting.

388
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,410
But it wasn't like this before.

389
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:33,167
When Tsukina… Yuzuki's mother was around,

390
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,938
no one dared to delay
their yearly tribute.

391
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,549
Tsukina was super scary.

392
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:42,485
I've been punched by her several times.

393
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,982
But… at that time,
it actually felt reassuring.

394
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:48,525
Everyone is very uneasy now.

395
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,148
Since Tsukina left the temple,

396
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,968
everyone has been wondering about
the future of Mikazuki Temple.

397
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:58,628
Why did she leave the temple?

398
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,310
I'm not very clear about that.

399
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,221
I only heard that she is now
living near the Head Temple.

400
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:06,011
Akagami!

401
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,289
Akagami!

402
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,783
Breasts are great!

403
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,408
Great, great.

404
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:16,473
Enough of that, you little perverts.

405
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,492
I'm really sorry about today.

406
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,300
Though an apology isn't going to do much.

407
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:26,011
That's a lot.

408
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,045
This rice is heavy, be careful.

409
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,289
It is indeed heavy.

410
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,113
The rice bag…

411
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:39,153
I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

412
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,538
Back then…

413
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,865
What is it, Akagami?

414
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:47,071
It's nothing.

415
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:50,271
I-I just felt a destiny.

416
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,124
I see.

417
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,210
Yes… I should be grateful
for that encounter.

418
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,776
And fully support Miss Yuzuki.

419
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,203
Let's go home.

420
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,525
It's just like Yuzuki.

421
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,576
Does she really… need help?

422
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,690
(Next Episode: The Body is Very Honest)

423
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,336
What did you dream about
for your first dream of the New Year?

424
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,665
I dreamed about Akagami swinging around.

425
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:50,557
What was swinging around?

426
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:53,363
Sis Yuzuki and Sis Tsukuyo
were also there.

427
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,346
Doing what?

428
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,096
Everyone was swinging around,
loving each other.

429
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,119
Loving each other…
