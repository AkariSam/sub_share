1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,192
We decided you should
repay with your body.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,846
What?

3
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:13,163
No, no!

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,363
I mean we can let him work
here to pay off the debt!

5
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:19,443
Did he threaten you, Yuzuki?

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,101
Why would someone like Yuzuki
make such a decision?

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,905
Did Akagami get something on her?

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,096
-Do you have any objections?
-No.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,616
So, Akagami,

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,781
let me show you around this temple.

11
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,266
Thank you!

00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:09,186

This is the main Buddha of our temple.

Wrapped in tape?

(Episode 2: Being Lewd Isn't A Bad Thing)

17
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:12,942
What?

18
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:14,570
Because we are poor.

19
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:17,187
I understand.

20
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,846
I will try my best to repay
the debt as soon as possible.

21
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:22,404
With all my might!

22
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:25,480
Alright, I'm counting on you.

23
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:27,780
But you can take your time.

24
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:32,303
Although I don't know why
you want to become a monk,

25
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:34,191
I can see that you didn't come here

26
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:35,855
just to kill time.

27
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:37,848
Miss Aoba.

28
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:39,679
Just call me Yuzuki.

29
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:41,860
After all, there are several Aoba here.

30
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:43,270
Alright.

31
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,830
I'll show you around some other places.

32
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:46,856
Yes!

33
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,883
There's definitely something
wrong with Yuzuki.

34
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,219
They get along so well.

35
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:55,312
In this case, we have to do something!

36
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:58,002
Let's kick that guy out

37
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:00,242
and make Yuzuki come to her senses!

38
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:05,376
So, we'll have to seduce him.

39
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:08,594
Kiki, why are you here?

40
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:13,381
I saw you guys talking
about something interesting.

41
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:15,440
This is the plan.

42
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,371
First, we seduce Akagami,

43
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:19,547
and once he takes the bait,
we'll drive him out.

44
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:22,323
That way, Yuzuki will have to accept it.

45
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:23,687
I see.

46
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,114
So, who's going to seduce Akagami?

47
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,493
That would be

48
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:30,034
the person with the most desirable figure.

49
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:33,729
Who are you talking about?

50
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:35,957
Me?

51
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:38,760
No, no, no.

52
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:41,462
Kiki can do it. She's so busty!

53
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:44,103
What are you talking about? I'm a nun.

54
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:46,730
Now you remember you're a nun.

55
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:48,760
Tsukuyo, you can do it.

56
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,644
Tsukuyo, good luck.

57
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:53,735
-Wait, hold on.
-Tsukuyo, you're so cool when seducing.

58
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:54,890
What did you say?

59
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,737
How fulfilling!

60
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,445
I feel like I'm gradually
finding my old self.

61
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:13,480
That's right, I've found
my once pure self.

62
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:17,077
Oh, Akagami, you're up so early.

63
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:18,373
Yuzuki.

64
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:22,157
Good morning.

65
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,864
Miss Yuzuki, you're up early too.

66
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:28,581
I have to ring the bell every day

67
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,784
to replace my alarm clock at home.

68
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:33,103
Alright, see you later.

69
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,612
Desires!

70
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,037
He was definitely looking
at Yuzuki's chest.

71
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:44,934
I have to find a way
to drive this guy out!

72
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,046
Guys,

73
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:49,172
breakfast is ready!

74
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,063
Let me have a taste first.

75
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:56,104
First, I'll disparage
the breakfast he made.

76
00:04:58,738 --> 00:04:59,570
I'll dig in.

77
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:02,355
I'll dig in.

78
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:05,524
This is so delicious.

79
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:07,134
What kind of divine taste is this?

80
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:09,886
He's a better cook than anyone else here!

81
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:13,346
Damn, I want to eat this every day!

82
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,419
I'm so glad it suits your taste.

83
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,021
My work experience when
living alone came in handy!

84
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:27,186
Although I was a little
disoriented just now,

85
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:29,639
there's no need to worry.

86
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,685
Um, well…

87
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:32,542
What…

88
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,974
He really pays a lot of attention to it.

89
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:42,598
This guy definitely
has a breast obsession.

90
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:45,620
I'd like to ask you to do something else.

91
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:46,776
Mr. Handyman.

92
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:48,556
Um…

93
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:50,620
What is this?

94
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,975
This is the work uniform,
the temple's practice clothing.

95
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:54,880
Wear this to work.

96
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,773
I lied. It's actually summer clothing.

97
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,269
The fabric is thin, and he's barefoot.

98
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:03,554
In November, dressing like that
in the temple is unbearable!

99
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,036
-This way, we can get rid of him…
-Miss Second!

100
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:07,036
Thank you very much!

101
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,514
-This is the temple's practice clothing.
-What's so happy about?

102
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,210
Why he called me Miss Second?

103
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,296
Anyway, just get to work.

104
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:15,896
First you'll do the cleaning!

105
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:17,234
Yes!

106
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,104
I've finished.

107
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,680
No way, it's so clean.

108
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,828
But there are still the
bathrooms and toilets.

109
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:26,543
ANCESTRAL TOMBS
And the tombstones.

110
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:27,595
Of course, I cleaned them all.

111
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,922
This is a day's worth of work!

112
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:32,260
TEMPLE FINANCIAL SOFTWARE
Next is this!

113
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:35,375
-If you don't know how to do office work…
-This account book…

114
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:36,818
There seems to be a problem.

115
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:38,190
What? No way!

116
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:39,865
What is the problem?

117
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:41,791
-Here.
-Ah.

118
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:43,410
Change this part.

119
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:46,123
Wow, that's amazing! How did you do it?

120
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:50,011
No!

121
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:52,332
Well then…

122
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:59,283
Tsukuyo asked me to arrange your practice.

123
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:02,023
Sorry, we don't have a waterfall here.

124
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,222
That's alright.

125
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,443
This is waterfall practice.

126
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:07,918
It's freezing.

127
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:11,129
Can I endure it?

128
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:14,026
If you can't bear it, just say it.

129
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:16,136
Stop trying in vain!

130
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,848
No! I must endure!

131
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,104
I'm back.

132
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:22,593
What are you guys doing?

133
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:26,909
Miss Yuzuki

134
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:28,824
in school uniform!

135
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:33,395
How come I feel hot!

136
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:36,203
The hardships just now
seemed like nothing.

137
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,265
Could this be enlightenment?

138
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:42,468
Great! I did it!

139
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:44,966
Akagami, what's wrong?

140
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,908
Go take a bath and warm up!

141
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:48,740
Thank you very much.

142
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:51,785
What should I do?

143
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:54,857
So we'll have to do it that way, Tsukuyo.

144
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,755
Today is a perfect day.

145
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,763
The work and enlightenment
went very smoothly.

146
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:05,908
Did I slightly repay

147
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:07,508
Miss Yuzuki's kindness?

148
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:11,179
I can't bathe any longer.

149
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:13,408
I have to go prepare dinner.

150
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:25,507
This is really rude!

151
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:31,011
I'm sorry. What's the matter?

152
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,327
Why is she taking off her clothes?

153
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:35,645
I have to stay calm.

154
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:38,845
Let me sort out my thoughts.

155
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,040
No. I can't understand it at all!

156
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:44,453
What on earth is happening?

157
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:48,158
I took off my clothes too early.

158
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,016
Am I an idiot?

159
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:52,392
I suddenly took off my clothes.
I'm nothing but a female delinquent!

160
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:55,913
I was supposed to take
off my clothes in a panic,

161
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,610
and then be discovered by Yuzuki.

162
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:01,080
But after seeing his naked body,
my mind went blank.

163
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,190
Anyway,

164
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,551
I have to find a way to turn the tables.

165
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:06,993
YUZUKI WILL GO TO THE BATHROOM IN FIVE MINUTES
Before Yuzuki comes,

166
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:10,001
YUZUKI WILL GO TO THE BATHROOM IN FIVE MINUTES
I must create a scene of being attacked by Akagami.

167
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:13,463
If I take off a little more now,

168
00:09:13,463 --> 00:09:15,685
he should pounce on me.

169
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:17,431
No, this is my limit.

170
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,695
If I continue to take off, I'll be naked!
Now I'm really a female delinquent!

171
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:21,979
I…

172
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:26,070
Watch out!

173
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:35,835
Miss Second, are you alright?

174
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:41,159
Tsukuyo, what happened?
What was that loud noise?

175
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,670
No! This is…

176
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:48,914
I didn't mean to go this far.

177
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:51,342
Eh? Why am I the one trying to explain?

178
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:54,550
Anyway, the plan was successful.

179
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:57,812
Akagami.

180
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:59,343
Yes.

181
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,839
Please leave for now.

182
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:04,581
Yes.

183
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:06,895
Eh?

184
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,615
Eh?

185
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:12,501
Eh?

186
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:14,182
I'm so touched!

187
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,622
Tsukuyo stepped forward

188
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:18,759
and made the seduction plan a success!

189
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,477
As expected of Tsukuyo.

190
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,917
Sis Tsukuyo is so lewd and cool.

191
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,951
Kurage, ever since yesterday,
you've been talking about me strangely.

192
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:29,142
What did you actually do?

193
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,262
Can you tell us?

194
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:35,109
Now we can kick that guy out completely!

195
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,305
Kick him out?

196
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:41,749
But why am I so restless?

197
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:44,673
Sis Yuzuki.

198
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:47,367
Huh?

199
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,646
Hey, Yuzuki.

200
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:51,438
Yuzuki.

201
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,463
No, this is so weird.

202
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,639
I can understand if
she's avoiding Akagami.

203
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:57,773
But why is she avoiding me too.

204
00:10:58,938 --> 00:10:59,727
Yuzuki!

205
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:02,607
Why are you avoiding me?

206
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,583
Wait! Don't come over, Tsukuyo.

207
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:07,444
What are you saying? You're going too far.

208
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:10,557
I feel a bit embarrassed too,

209
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,090
but you are ignoring me.

210
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,523
Yuzuki?

211
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:16,788
It's not like that! Whenever I see
your face, I can't help but think of…

212
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:18,869
Think of what?

213
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:20,755
Akagami's naked body.

214
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,501
Actually, just a small part of his body.

215
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:28,650
Yuzuki, you're so lewd.

216
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:30,101
Lewd!

217
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,938
You are the lewd one, Tsukuyo!

218
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:33,749
Talking about a seduction plan.

219
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:36,688
Eh, how did you know?

220
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,177
Kiki told me.

221
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:41,269
That nun!

222
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:43,940
Yuzuki,

223
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:46,756
why did you agree to let
Akagami live in our temple?

224
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:48,484
You still don't accept him?

225
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:50,861
It's more like I find it strange

226
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:53,295
that a male attendant is in a nunnery.

227
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,581
I didn't accept it without hesitation.

228
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,943
But I think mother would definitely do so.

229
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,135
-She would.
-Right?

230
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:07,679
She would definitely welcome anyone
who wants to live in this temple.

231
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:10,979
Yeah, she would welcome anyone.

232
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:12,870
Besides,

233
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:16,198
Akagami seemed very unwilling.

234
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,014
He really wanted to change himself.

235
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,178
Unwillingness is the proof of sincerity.

236
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,570
Although I can only see a little bit,

237
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:28,194
Akagami is easy to understand.

238
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:32,118
Have I ever tried to
get to know that guy?

239
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,942
I lost to you, Yuzuki.

240
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:39,879
Back then,

241
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,079
He protected me too.

242
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:46,027
So, Tsukuyo.

243
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:48,723
Let's go find Akagami and explain it.

244
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,337
Akagami

245
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,931
just packed his luggage and left.

246
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,034
Eh?

247
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,840
PRETTY GIRLS OF THE TEMPLE HARMED
THEMSELVES WHEN HARMING OTHERS.

248
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:01,918
I can't

249
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:03,879
face them anymore.

250
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:05,473
Akagami.

251
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:08,097
Please leave for now.

252
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:11,893
I can't keep embarrassing myself.

253
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:14,453
TEMPLE POLICE STATION
I might as well turn myself in!

254
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:16,474
WANTED CRIMINAL
Yes, not long ago,

255
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,586
a female roommate peeked at me
while I was taking a bath.

256
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,570
For some reason, she suddenly
started undressing.

257
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,542
And I stole a kiss from her.

258
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:24,794
So, I'm turning myself in.

259
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,543
Don't come back.

260
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:29,470
Why?

261
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:33,193
Maybe I should go back to my old house.

262
00:13:33,738 --> 00:13:36,746
A new tenant moved in.

263
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:39,670
So what about my belongings?

264
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:41,462
We threw them away.

265
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:47,793
I'm homeless now.

266
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:53,252
Is everyone eating well?

267
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,949
With Miss Yuzuki around,
there's definitely no problem.

268
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,893
She might seem like an innocent
young lady at first glance,

269
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:01,621
but she's actually a very reliable woman.

270
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,053
She also got up very early today.

271
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:08,262
Desires.

272
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:09,926
Wait, no way.

273
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,870
I've already attained enlightenment,
but I still have desires.

274
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,120
That's right, my enlightenment

275
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,914
was achieved through
the help of Miss Second.

276
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:19,673
She is beautiful and competitive.

277
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,977
She seems to have quite a lot of
interactions with boys.

278
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,704
But she must have been deeply affected.

279
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,011
Why am I still plagued with desires?

280
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:32,272
Didn't I attain enlightenment
after my waterfall practice?

281
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:35,475
In that case,

282
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,523
even if I can only repay my debts,

283
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,539
ORGAN SELLING. SAY GOODBYE TO DEBT, WE WILL BUY YOUR PRECIOUS PROPERTY AT A HIGH PRICE.
I will put my life on the line.

284
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:39,469
AKAGAMI OWES 20 MILLION YEN. ESTIMATED VALUE FOR AKAGAMI'S ORGANS IS 18.9 MILLION YEN.
I will put my life on the line.

285
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:41,288
ORANGE

286
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,632
In the end,

287
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:45,548
I can't do anything on my own.

288
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:52,814
What are you doing?

289
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:55,307
It's winter now!

290
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:56,395
You could die!

291
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,339
Akagami! Look at me.

292
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,195
Why do you always avoid looking at me?

293
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,959
Because I can't bear
to look directly at you.

294
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,038
Geez!

295
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,814
How could you just run
out of the temple like that?

296
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:11,993
Because you told me to leave.

297
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,757
Bathroom!

298
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:17,367
I meant for you to leave the bathroom!

299
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:18,228
Bathroom?

300
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,085
Listen, Akagami!

301
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,069
You're still a child.

302
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:23,925
You should act more spoiled!

303
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:25,721
As for what happened in the bathroom,

304
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:28,025
you just need to explain
yourself and it'll be fine!

305
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:31,097
Please rely on me more.

306
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:34,041
Akagami, you're a newcomer and a child.

307
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:36,938
How old are you, Akagami?

308
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm 21.

309
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:42,570
ORANGE
You're the older one.

310
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:45,615
ORANGE
Aoba Yuzuki. I am 17.

311
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,279
ORANGE
Glad to know.

312
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,282
You're a mature adult now.

313
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,394
You should act more spoiled!

314
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:55,336
If you don't know how to act spoiled

315
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,768
or how to ask for help,

316
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,675
you can rely on me

317
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,363
for all of that!

318
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:09,187
Miss Yuzuki.

319
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,811
Although I only had
a vague feeling before,

320
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,724
now I see that she truly
is very passionate.

321
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,353
-Akagami!
-Yes.

322
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:19,120
The first lesson you have learned is

323
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,000
that people cannot survive alone!

324
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:25,613
Since you've come to our temple,

325
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:27,491
we won't let you be alone anymore.

326
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,786
-Tsukuyo, what do you think?
-Eh?

327
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:32,534
Miss Second.

328
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:36,310
I'm sorry!

329
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,016
ORANGE
I shouldn't have set you up. I'm sorry.

330
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:41,768
ORANGE
I shouldn't have assumed that you were insincere. I'm sorry.

331
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:44,186
No, I also looked at your chest.

332
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:45,478
I even touched it and pushed you down.

333
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,312
Stop talking, you idiot!

334
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:48,974
Alright! I'm sorry!

335
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:52,888
Let's go back, Akagami!

336
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,526
-I'm hungry!
-I understand!

337
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,075
So, Akagami, hold out your hand!

338
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:05,222
FIRST KISS FEE: 5 MILLION YEN, AOBA TSUKUYO
That was my first kiss.

339
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:07,794
So, you'll take responsibility, right?

340
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:10,033
So realistic.

341
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:14,599
I'm back.

342
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:16,602
Welcome back.

343
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:17,899
I'm back too!

344
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,926
Please allow me

345
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,618
to return to this temple!

346
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:24,239
Shut up and just get in.

347
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:26,174
Tsukuyo.

348
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,478
Why is this guy back?

349
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,883
It's okay to just let him stay.

350
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:33,698
Thank you very much!

351
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:37,198
Mia!

352
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:39,735
What's going on with her?

353
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,076
It is a bit complicated.

354
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:43,424
Tsukuyo, do you want to

355
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:45,040
take a bath with me?

356
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:46,220
That's right.

357
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,919
Miss Second, you're also
soaked from the rain.

358
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:50,268
I'M NOT
I'll pass.

359
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:51,281
By the way,

360
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,446
just call me Tsukuyo.

361
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:55,382
It's a bit embarrassing.

362
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,327
Alright, got it.

363
00:17:58,513 --> 00:18:01,104
Welcome back, Sis Tsukuyo.

364
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:02,323
Kurage.

365
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,819
Akagami, you're back too.

366
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:07,277
Yes, Miss Third.

367
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:08,837
I'm really ashamed.

368
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,944
Kurage is Miss Third, right?

369
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:14,263
Yuzuki said she's waiting
for you in the bathroom.

370
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:16,949
There's no need to rush, right?

371
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,124
The usually reliable Yuzuki

372
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,780
is acting quite carelessly today.

373
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:25,536
She used to be even more silly.

374
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:29,295
She was carefree and straightforward.

375
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:33,113
-Seemed thoughtful but actually empty-headed.
-Stop it, Kurage.

376
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,817
It's true that she was even
more careless before though.

377
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:39,731
Useless?

378
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:41,290
What?

379
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,034
Alright, you successfully confused me.

380
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:45,954
No, Miss Third.

381
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,014
You can't speak ill of your sister.

382
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:50,492
That's right.

383
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,415
Yuzuki is just a bit too thoughtless.

384
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:55,496
You're not making it sound better.

385
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,939
Tsukuyo, hurry up!

386
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,179
I got it, Yuzuki.

387
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,683
I feel a bit off lately.

388
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:04,970
Tsukuyo loves our big sister too.

389
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:08,011
Uh, it's already this late.

390
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:11,223
Miss Third, I'm going to prepare dinner.

391
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:13,984
I'll help you.

392
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:16,850
Speaking of which,

393
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:20,635
you said Miss Yuzuki is useless.

394
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:22,109
It's true.

395
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,221
It's hard to imagine.

396
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,746
Of course, you've only just met her.

397
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:29,538
That's true.

398
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:32,350
But I really want to know!

399
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,470
Don't be silly!

400
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,582
It's an invasion of privacy.

401
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:37,543
But,

402
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,188
the 17 years of Miss Yuzuki's
life that I don't know,

403
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,935
I want to know everything if possible!

404
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:45,357
Do you want to peep into the bathroom?

405
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:46,729
Why do you ask that?

406
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:49,008
You just said you want to know everything.

407
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,392
Did I accidentally say it out loud?

408
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:54,536
No, I definitely didn't mean it.

409
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:56,285
Besides, this is a temple.

410
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:58,269
Shamelessness is like a capital crime.

411
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:01,676
Being lewd is not a bad thing.

412
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:04,513
What?

413
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:05,996
We're all human.

414
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,777
We're all human.

415
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,506
Even Buddha has children.

416
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,100
I'm also a monk's child.

417
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:14,915
The thing between men and women…

418
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,613
Stop, Miss Third.

419
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,168
And Yuzuki is probably quite lewd too.

420
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,447
In a repressed way.

421
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:25,001
Repressed?

422
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,031
So I think even if you peep,
she probably wouldn't get angry.

423
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:30,776
That's not right.

424
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:33,693
This child is so innocent.

425
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:36,003
And that makes her very dangerous.

426
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,030
Well…

427
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:40,566
I was joking.

428
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:41,414
Huh?

429
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,038
Yuzuki used to like

430
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,278
teasing others like that.

431
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:48,046
But since then,

432
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:50,862
she became perfect.

433
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:53,469
So did Tsukuyo.

434
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:55,709
She gradually became more like an adult.

435
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:58,973
But after you came,

436
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:01,324
they began to look stupid.

437
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,562
I prefer when they are stupid.

438
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:08,406
So, I'm very happy

439
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:09,814
that you came back.

440
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:11,937
Thank you.

441
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:16,852
She's such a good child.

442
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:18,969
Don't thank me!

443
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,966
So, as a reward,

444
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,613
I'll show you.

445
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:23,878
Eh?

446
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:26,258
Everything about my sisters.

447
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,611
Stop! Miss Third!

448
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:30,406
-Stop!
-Done it.

449
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:50,561
Geez. Don't tease Akagami anymore.

450
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:51,976
Okay.

451
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,155
I understand, Miss Third.

452
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,011
Being lewd is wrong.

453
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:00,986
You seem very happy.

454
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:02,273
But,

455
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:03,990
this temple is depraved!

456
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,419
Akagami! It's all your fault!

457
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:46,938
NEXT EPISODE
Akagami saw

458
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:48,563
(Let Me Castrate You)
my private part.

459
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:50,430
Could it be…

460
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:52,795
He saw me licking the ice cream lid.

461
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:55,398
Oh my, I thought it was there.

462
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:59,317
-By the way, he also saw my chest.
-Akagami?
