1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,784
Do you want to inherit Mikazuki Temple?

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,832
Are you serious, Yuzuki?

3
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:13,459
Inheriting this temple
is a huge responsibility.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,158
So, what makes you want to inherit it?

5
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:17,183
Because I…

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,166
WORLDLY DESIRES

7
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,072
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

8
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:53,839
Since then, I haven't talked to Akagami.

9
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,260
Forget it!

10
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,204
This has nothing to do with you, Akagami!

11
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,285
(Episode 12: Humans Can't Survive Alone)
Is he angry?

12
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,558
(Episode 12: Humans Can't Survive Alone)
He must be angry.

13
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,228
I have to apologize to him.

14
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,013
That's it.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,832
Akagami will understand me for sure.

16
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,247
-I really appreciate it.
-That's Akagami.

17
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:21,344
-I will pay attention.
-Well, but you'll get used to it as you use it.

18
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:25,805
Huh?

19
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:27,853
Why should I run away?

20
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,309
There are no suitable jobs on

21
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,562
the job site at the start of the year.

22
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:44,859
Don't be concerned with
what I, an outsider, am doing.

23
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,945
It's my fault for being so childish.

24
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,714
Okay, I need to talk to her today
and make up with her.

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,284
Good morning, Akagami.

26
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,051
G-Good morning.

27
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,343
Keep up the good work today.

28
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,905
Miss Yuzuki?

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,296
Isn't it good luck to be buried
in Buddhist supplies?

30
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,194
Are you okay?

31
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,751
I'm fine, don't worry.

32
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,828
Um, Miss Yuzuki.

33
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,598
I have something…

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,596
Wait a moment.

35
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,004
Kiki?

36
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:25,461
Yuzuki, please move these things
to the warehouse.

37
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:27,144
Oh. Okay.

38
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:28,933
Akagami, come with me for a moment.

39
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,391
I have something to say to you.

40
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,612
What do you need me for?

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,034
What happened between you and Yuzuki?

42
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:42,465
Well…actually…

43
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,829
OH MY
So you two had a love fight.

44
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,877
OH MY
No, it's just a fight.

45
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,654
Yeah, yeah.
You guys seem to be getting along great.

46
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,499
Initially, it was simply
that we each had our own viewpoint.

47
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,369
I had no idea it would
get so bad this time.

48
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,094
Akagami, what is this?

49
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:06,927
-Breasts…
-Right.

50
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,340
This is me, Kiki.

51
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:12,562
Yes, that's what I think too.

52
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,724
In the eyes of different people,

53
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,883
I have different identities,
such as nun, abbot, master, and so on.

54
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,461
But you only know about my breasts.

55
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,257
ERR

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,615
Fingers point to the moon,
but they are not the moon itself.

57
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,404
Even when we use our fingers
to indicate the moon,

58
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:31,564
some people may still focus on
the pointing fingers instead.

59
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,710
Just now, I pointed
at my breast on purpose

60
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:36,310
to get you to make a mistake.

61
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:37,974
Isn't that cheating?

62
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:41,110
I want you to pay attention
to the main idea.

63
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,487
The finger is just a signpost.

64
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,250
If you pay too much attention
to that finger,

65
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:48,706
you won't get the truth of the moon.

66
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,734
What does this mean?

67
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,174
How do you see

68
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,869
Yuzuki?

69
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:57,327
Miss Yuzuki

70
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:01,103
is very reliable
despite her eccentricities.

71
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,824
She's tenacious and always on the move…

72
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,355
She's a lot stronger than me.

73
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,948
That's what makes you so twisted, Akagami.

74
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,662
Kiki, we have a guest.

75
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,533
Did the guest mention why they're here?

76
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,572
RELOCATE GRAVES
She said she wanted to relocate the grave.

77
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,177
-This is a great opportunity!
-Why?

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,972
Because we can get a fee
for relocating the grave!

79
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:28,700
RELOCATING GRAVES REFERS TO
When parishioners relocate graves,

80
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,689
THE ACT WHERE DONORS, UPON LEAVING A TEMPLE,
they typically provide the temple with relocation fees or offerings.

81
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,028
MOVE THEIR ANCESTORS' GRAVES OUT OF THE TEMPLE
However, this means that our temple's parishioners are decreasing.

82
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:33,894
OR TO ANOTHER LOCATION
Isn't this a concerning situation?

83
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,223
The benefit of the present moment
is paramount at the moment.

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,220
This is also the guidance of the Buddha.

85
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,604
There's something seriously
off with her mind.

86
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,606
Leave this matter to me.

87
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:45,742
I'll ask for ten times the market price.

88
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,999
Master, isn't that a bit too much?

89
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:58,513
She said that she wants to relocate the
ancestral grave to a temple near her home.

90
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,950
After all, the area is difficult to access
due to a lack of public transportation.

91
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,643
The guest has already left?
What about the relocation fee?

92
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,842
Huh? I didn't receive it.

93
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,781
The relocation fee
is just a token of good faith.

94
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:10,701
So we won't forcefully demand it.

95
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,760
Wasn't this decided
when my mother was still around?

96
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,939
Even though that's the principle, but…

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,344
Parishioners used to come here despite
the inconvenience of transportation.

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
But that was back
when my mother was still around.

99
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,607
Leaving the ancestral grave to current
Mikazuki Temple worried the guest.

100
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,603
I'm really useless.

101
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:31,704
I can't be like my mother.

102
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,125
I've been trying

103
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,993
to win everyone over,

104
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,200
but I'm still a long way from her.

105
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,284
All right! I need to keep trying harder!

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,024
Miss Yuzuki.

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,080
It's time for you
to stop practicing, Yuzuki.

108
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,559
You're expelled.

109
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,134
Master, why?

110
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,270
Think about the reasons yourself.

111
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,573
Inheriting this temple
is a huge responsibility.

112
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,369
What makes you want to inherit it?

113
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,830
Because I…

114
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:18,445
What was my answer back then?

115
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,382
Right. I don't need to practice anymore.

116
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,822
No way. Now is not the time to be down.

117
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,086
I still have a lot to do.

118
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,384
We'll need to keep up
our efforts in the new year.

119
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,075
What should we do specifically?

120
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,217
Specifically… Um…

121
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:47,489
Is it to commit seppuku and then write
the first letter of the year in blood?

122
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,840
That's quite exotic.

123
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,436
I don't think it's that one.

124
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,094
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE HAS 80 ZABUTONS
Dry zabutons in the sun.

125
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,719
IT'S MORE THAN A HUNDRED IF YOU INCLUDE THE TATAMIS
Clean up the tatamis and so on.

126
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,410
Should we also clean
the Buddhist supplies carefully?

127
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:02,701
Aside from practicing, there are plenty
of other things to do in the temple.

128
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,870
However, it appears to be a simple task.

129
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,244
It's all thanks to Akagami.

130
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,632
He always keeps the temple clean.

131
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,728
He also regularly dries the zabutons
and tatamis in the sun.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,624
I also helped clean the Buddhist supplies.

133
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,081
But there are still many other things…

134
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,426
We can get this done quickly
if we all pitch in, right?

135
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,911
I see. Huh?

136
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,692
Where is Akagami?

137
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:28,939
He went after Kiki when she went to work.

138
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,421
Why?

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,680
Who knows, I want to know too.

140
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,886
Why hasn't he read my message yet?

141
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,078
I've messaged him.

142
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,912
Is that Akagami's number?

143
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,928
How come you have his contact?

144
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,315
Why would you assume
I don't have his number?

145
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,122
I don't know either,
I really want it, too.

146
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,766
You're too cunning.

147
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,170
STUPID GAMI
Well, I have it.

148
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,228
How come?

149
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,286
Sis Tsukuyo, it's not good
for you to get ahead.

150
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,419
Even though Akagami has won you over.

151
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:06,717
I feel the need to correct
something you said.

152
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,440
LIVELY DISCUSSION
Help me, Sis Yuzuki.

153
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,488
Sis Yuzuki?

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,100
Akagami is indeed impressive.

155
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,404
Not only is his work flawless,
but he is also extremely popular.

156
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:18,581
But, I'm not bad either!

157
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,659
It's spotless.

158
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,556
Don't worry, Akagami.

159
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,562
I will find a solution.

160
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,807
That's right, I must do something.

161
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,555
Didn't Mother

162
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,689
do it all on her own?

163
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:50,944
CONSTRUCTION WORKER, TUTOR

164
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,280
MINERAL WATER, TEA, GRAPE SODA

165
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,606
HIGH PAYING JOB OFFER, ANILA

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,032
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)
ALL PHENOMENA ARE WITHOUT A SELF

167
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,233
Master, I beg you.

168
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,217
Please allow Miss Yuzuki
to resume her practice!

169
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:29,685
Please!

170
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,330
You ought to think about where
you are saying this before saying it.

171
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,640
And don't let me repeat myself.

172
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,052
The current Yuzuki

173
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,572
is no longer qualified.

174
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,272
Master, your credentials as an abbot
are also rather peculiar.

175
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,171
So please!

176
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,081
Do you want to be expelled as well?

177
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,028
Yuzuki needs
to figure this out for herself.

178
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:51,843
Other people's interference is pointless.

179
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,134
Please enlighten me!

180
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:55,899
The payment is on you.

181
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:57,891
Master!

182
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,433
Wow, it's raining.

183
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,326
I finally got in touch with you!

184
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,610
Miss Tsukuyo?

185
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,637
Sorry, I'm busy now…

186
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:08,211
Sis Yuzuki has gone missing,

187
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,002
so it doesn't matter
if you're busy or not.

188
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:22,101
She acted very peculiarly this morning.

189
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,492
Can you guess where she could be going?

190
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
I'm very worried.

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,416
So Akagami,

192
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,812
how do you see

193
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,564
BUDDHIST SUPPLY STORE, TSUKISHITA
Yuzuki?

194
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,246
Miss Yuzuki is very reliable

195
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,614
despite her eccentricities.

196
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,980
She's tenacious and always on the move…

197
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,837
It's freezing… What to do?

198
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,460
I think I'm running a fever…

199
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,072
I must work harder…

200
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,870
To get everyone to agree on me.

201
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,260
I have to learn to be
independent and capable.

202
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,585
If I don't do this, I'll never be
as successful as Mother was.

203
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,277
Damn. Where else could she possibly go?

204
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,588
Could it be…

205
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,438
Mother is beautiful, strong,
and capable of anything.

206
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,254
Those around her
had a high regard for her…

207
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:42,963
Mother is a perfect person…

208
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,134
The Mikazuki Temple
is going to be deserted soon.

209
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,573
Get ready to leave this place.

210
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,132
Did you hear that?

211
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,566
How did things turn out
this way all of a sudden? Mother!

212
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,702
This is settled and final.

213
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:57,438
Wait a moment, Mother!

214
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,422
I will inherit this temple!

215
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:01,306
Yuzuki, you are going to inherit?

216
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,185
That is…

217
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,361
You can't.

218
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,718
You can't save the Mikazuki Temple.

219
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,578
I can't…

220
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,650
Tell me, Mother.

221
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,365
Is it because I'm useless?

222
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,175
Where am I falling short?

223
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,458
I have to… reach perfection.

224
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,086
I need to work harder…

225
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:40,683
It's time for you
to stop practicing, Yuzuki.

226
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:43,037
It's not enough… it's not enough…

227
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:45,311
Miss Yuzuki, as expected, is incapable!

228
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,093
I need to work even harder…

229
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:50,403
You can't.

230
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,225
It's not enough…

231
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:54,837
Do not separate our family.

232
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,361
Please come back, Mother.

233
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:00,855
It's freezing.

234
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,166
She certainly wouldn't
be somewhere like that.

235
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,521
Could it be…

236
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:12,657
After all, Miss Yuzuki…

237
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,833
is much stronger than me.

238
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:28,283
That's what makes you so twisted, Akagami.

239
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,062
Aka…gami?

240
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,177
How exactly

241
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:43,873
do I see Miss Yuzuki?

242
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:47,123
She manages to grin even
when she's feeling down.

243
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,426
Her tenacity is merely
another manifestation of her insecurity.

244
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,146
The real her is so…

245
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,016
You're so warm, Akagami.

246
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,213
Can't do it. I still have a fever
and can't even sit up.

247
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,119
-Akagami!
-Miss Yuzuki, you're awake.

248
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,884
That's right, I need to apologize

249
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,028
I must apologize first!

250
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,037
Sor…

251
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,969
Sorry.

252
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:51,209
I should be the one to apologize.

253
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,273
I feel like we haven't
talked in a long time.

254
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,296
Yes.

255
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:10,081
MINERAL WATER, 10 HOURS CONTINUOUS COOLING
Did you watch over me all night long?

256
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,459
I got tired and fell asleep
in the middle of the night.

257
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:13,921
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,574
Why are you apologizing?

259
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,074
Because…

260
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,952
Under that bridge…
I can't believe you remember that place.

261
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,575
I assumed you wouldn't do

262
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,303
something stupid like I did.

263
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,935
Miss Kurage told me
that you are a silly and stupid person.

264
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,405
Silly and stupid?

265
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:36,357
And that place holds

266
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:38,149
many memories for me.

267
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,373
The first component of enlightenment.

268
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,149
Humans can't survive alone.

269
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,736
My father often said this.

270
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,970
Although he used it as
an excuse to have a harem,

271
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,360
so I strongly disliked this phrase.

272
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:02,328
Then I made the decision
to live alone from then on.

273
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,440
But you completely overturned my thoughts.

274
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:09,920
For me, under that bridge

275
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,544
is the place where
my whole world turned upside down.

276
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,914
So Miss Yuzuki,
please let me join you from now on!

277
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,316
Akagami.

278
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:22,620
You said you wouldn't

279
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:24,412
leave me alone back then.

280
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,076
But you, the one saying that,

281
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:28,024
are bearing the entire burden.

282
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:29,783
Please let me

283
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,279
be a part of your destiny, too.

284
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,337
But none of this has anything
to do with you, Akagami.

285
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:40,850
This time, too,

286
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:44,097
it's all due to my lack of ability…

287
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,307
You did nothing wrong.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,560
You're working hard when you could be

289
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:53,011
doing something more enjoyable.

290
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,109
It's my fault that you--

291
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,006
I'm doing these things entirely
of my own accord.

292
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,834
My feelings for this temple are

293
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,467
as strong as yours, Miss Yuzuki.

294
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,852
Because I am

295
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:12,138
most fond of the Mikazuki Temple!

296
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,258
I remember now.

297
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:20,570
It's for such a simple reason.

298
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,581
Thank you, Akagami.

299
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,675
Thank you so much.

300
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,871
We all heard it.

301
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,480
COLD MEDICINE
How long have you been there?

302
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,923
COLD MEDICINE
We've been here since Akagami put this in your medicine.

303
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:43,094
COLD MEDICINE
Did you add something to it?

304
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,725
COLD MEDICINE
I didn't add anything.

305
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,538
Sis Yuzuki.

306
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,355
Tsukuyo.

307
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,208
Idiot!

308
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,998
You really worry people!

309
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,533
Worry people!

310
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,511
The tickling punishment.

311
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:02,167
Perhaps the watching adult videos
punishment is more to your liking?

312
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,491
Um, Sis Yuzuki.

313
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:12,822
We like Mikazuki Temple
just as much as you do.

314
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:16,073
So don't think about ditching us.

315
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,582
Everyone…

316
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,091
And

317
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,750
WE'VE ALL GOT IT

318
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,758
it seems Sis Yuzuki
is about to be ditched by us.

319
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,458
The only person

320
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:27,314
who doesn't have Akagami's number is you.

321
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,722
WE'VE ALL GOT IT

322
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,254
I want it too!

323
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,559
You look quite vivacious.

324
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,121
Kiki.

325
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:42,966
Um, Master!

326
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:46,481
Kiki, I have realized

327
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,554
why I was expelled

328
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,698
and where I am deficient.

329
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,506
I worry a lot because I'm not as competent

330
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:58,031
as my mother

331
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,865
and therefore care too much about
what other people think of me.

332
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:04,065
But actually, I just want to be an abbot

333
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:07,263
to keep this temple
and everyone connected.

334
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:09,787
Please

335
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,880
allow me to continue practicing with you.

336
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,119
Master!

337
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:21,290
Firstly, you need to get well.

338
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:24,239
Let's talk about
the final stage of practice afterwards.

339
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,643
Thank you very much!

340
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,048
Stop playing and get some rest.

341
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,863
Geez.

342
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:36,335
Kiki.

343
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,382
-Thank you.
-No need to thank me.

344
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:41,110
But…

345
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,723
The desire for the approval of others

346
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,910
is the furthest private desire

347
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:48,110
from enlightenment.

348
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,758
It's just that Yuzuki realized

349
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,766
what attitude an abbot should have.

350
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:56,785
I

351
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,601
didn't do anything.

352
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:12,067
Are you well enough to get up?

353
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,065
My fever has subsided.

354
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,592
I'm giving up the part-time job.

355
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,125
I'll try to solicit alms

356
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,258
from the parishioners to cover
the cost of the main Buddha's repair.

357
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,674
Will they be willing to?

358
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:32,456
I believe it will be
extremely difficult as well.

359
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,994
That is why, back then,
I would rather sacrifice myself

360
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,874
to protect Mikazuki Temple.

361
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,870
But I was mistaken about that.

362
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:46,106
What results from someone's sacrifice

363
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,538
will never last.

364
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:52,757
The fifth component of enlightenment.

365
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,526
Don't try to hide
your own insufficiencies.

366
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,508
I will protect Mikazuki Temple
with everyone.

367
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes. With everyone!

368
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:05,497
You forgot to bring this.

369
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:08,883
Oh, sorry.

370
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,546
You did it on purpose.

371
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,481
No way!

372
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,474
Akagami.

373
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,372
A kiss before going out.

374
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,648
Kurage, come back for the family meeting.

375
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:32,332
Please don't tease me, Miss Kurage.

376
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,192
Akagami, you're an idiot.

377
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,229
Idiot, idiot, idiot.

378
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:38,111
Mia, are you still not ready?

379
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:39,791
Coming!

380
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,862
S-Sorry!

381
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,605
Are you okay?

382
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:51,955
This is nothing.

383
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,030
How did it suddenly get dark?

384
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,510
It's okay, do you want
to suck on my breasts?

385
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:06,592
No need.

386
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,954
Mia, this is a very
important parishioners tour.

387
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,202
Don't be late.

388
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,555
Okay.

389
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:13,915
This is your first time
helping out, good luck!

390
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,103
Sorry for the wait.

391
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,808
We're off now.

392
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:19,664
Hmm, be careful on the road.

393
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,538
The remaining work in the temple…

394
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,980
Leave it to me.

395
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,711
Don't worry about Mikazuki Temple.

396
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,460
Yeah.

397
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:31,837
We'll leave it to you then.

398
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:33,243
Yeah

399
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,561
Only Sis Yuzuki

400
00:23:35,742 --> 00:23:38,057
did not come across anything
obscene this morning.

401
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:40,125
Kurage, what are you talking about?

402
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,072
Maybe there's more.

403
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,680
For example…

404
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,808
See.

405
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:52,569
Worldly desires, begone!

406
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,740
Oh my! Akagami, you idiot!
