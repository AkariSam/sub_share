1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,192
Listen up, Akemitsu.

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:07,498
No one can live just by themselves.

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,714
Dad, what are you talking about?

4
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:13,464
Akemitsu, you're part of the Akagami
family, so you should understand.

5
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:16,766
Two is better than one,
and more is better than just two.

6
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:19,262
You would also like more friends, right?

7
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,723
So I'm thinking

8
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:26,746
it's better to have more lovers.

9
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:29,165
Dad, you're so cool!

10
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:33,060
Someone's here to pick me up.

11
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:36,771
Dad, are you going somewhere?

12
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,288
Yes.

13
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,552
I've decided to live my own life!

14
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:47,541
I'm going to fall in love with girls
I've never seen before in the world.

15
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:51,804
Dad, you're so cool!

16
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,009
Wow, Dad!

00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:55,304
So funny.

21
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:05,930
I have to go to university now!

no one can live just by themselves.

25
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:21,489
Two more laps!

26
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:24,127
-Oh my.
-Oh man.

27
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:27,290
-What a nice butt.
-Yeah.

28
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:28,790
Oh, Akagami.

29
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,390
Come take a look.

30
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:32,502
Sorry, I need to work.

31
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:36,022
Still the same old Akagami.

32
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:38,516
Hey, do you want to go to a mixer?

33
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,782
No.

35
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:48,652
I, Akagami Akemitsu,
don't need women in my life.

LONELY MART
Thank you.

37
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:58,664
Sorry for asking you to
make the shift, Akagami.

38
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,320
It's okay, boss..

39
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,594
But is it really okay to keep you so late?

40
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:05,474
Don't you have a date with
your girlfriend or something?

41
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:08,098
I'm single!

42
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:09,890
Really?

43
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:12,598
When your dad was your age…

44
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:15,231
I'm not like my dad.

45
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,525
LONELY MART
So-sorry.

46
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,012
LONELY MART
Welcome!

47
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,966
Dad, you're so cool!

48
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,633
That scumbag old man.

49
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:38,675
What's cool about him?
I was so naive at five!

50
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,197
It's all because of that old man.

51
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,757
He made me feel shameful wherever I go.

52
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:46,855
Akagami Akemitsu is…

53
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,917
Ah, he's from that family!

54
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:53,333
No! He's gonna violate me!

55
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:57,279
I'll clear this stain myself.

56
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:59,546
MIXER GIRLFRIEND
Mixer? Girlfriend?

57
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,375
Those are just burdens!

58
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,274
I'll live a magnificent life alone!

59
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,208
I'll pass the national civil service exam,

60
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:09,073

and a certain social status.

62
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:12,416
And after that…

After that…

64
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:17,101
Hey!

65
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:28,710
Where did this bag of rice come from?

66
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,360
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:38,802
Are you okay? Are you injured?

68
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:44,766
I'm really sorry! The cart flipped.

69
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,517
Um…

70
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,287
Can you stand up?

71
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,655
Is there any pain?

72
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:53,007
What should I do?

73
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,735
Anyway, I'll call an ambulance first…

74
00:05:56,496 --> 00:05:58,032
I'm fine.

75
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:00,291
It's okay, it's okay.

76
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:02,049
Wait a minute!

77
00:06:02,471 --> 00:06:04,647
Not good, not good, not good.

78
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:06,631
I can't believe I faltered so easily.

79
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:07,826
This is not good.

80
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:10,689
Oh heck!

81
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:24,512
So cute.

82
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,121
The last lap!

83
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:35,875
Let's go watch the girls today.

84
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,311
Sounds good.

85
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:42,667
Akagami?

86
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,198
So sexy.

87
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,628
We're going to the mixer.

88
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,765
You're not going, right?

89
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,242
I'm going.

90
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:57,296
-Really? What about class?
-Not attending.

91
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,294
-What about your work?
-Not going.

92
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,646
Cheers!

93
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,928
WANT TO DO THIS AND THAT
ENTWINED IN DESIRE

94
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,363
What am I doing?

95
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,958
I fell in love at first
sight with that girl!

96
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,030
Now all I think about every day is her.

97
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:17,038
I was hit by a wave of worldly desires!

98
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,080
I got fired from my part-time
job before I realized it!

99
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,072
FOR SKIPPING WORK

100
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,760
And I lost so many credit points!

101
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,746
FOR SKIPPING CLASSES

102
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:27,138
Is this the curse of the Akagami family?

103
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,621
NOT REALLY

104
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,408

Mixer? I'll be there in a minute.

107
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,865
Damn it!

108
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:40,135
Looks like there's only one way!

112
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:48,407
Yes.

Becoming a monk…

114
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,750
Have you found a temple already?

115
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,244
My uncle used to be an abbot.

116
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,164
He even prepared my
monk's robe after I told him!

117
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,419
There must be some other way

118
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,531
to eliminate worldly desires.

119
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:04,232

MIKAZUKI TEMPLE

122
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,284
Is this the place?

123
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,672
I'll practice Buddhism at the
temple my uncle introduced

124
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,318
and avoid all contact with women.

125
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:21,437
That way, I won't be
obsessed with her again.

126
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:26,888
Please!

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,984
Please!

128
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:32,676
Yes?

129
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:39,238
May I help you?

130
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:45,214
Um, wait…

131
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,798
Geez! Is this a prank or something?

132
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:54,009
Monk's robe? Um, no way.

133
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,177
Please wait for a moment!

134
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,074
Why is she here?

135
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,402
There shouldn't be any women here, right?

136
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,897
Is it a hallucination
caused by my desires?

137
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,907
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:19,010
Please excuse my rudeness.

139
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:23,160
Thank you for coming all this way.

140
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,912
My name is Aoba Yuzuki.

141
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:30,368
Eh, where are you going?

142
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:39,249
Are you okay?

143
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,219
No, this won't do!

144
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:50,151
I can still hold back
only because I'm trying to!

145
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:52,694
-I'm sorry, my kimono is a bit…
-Don't look!

146
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:55,271
I have to get out of
here quickly! I need to…

147
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,530
Hurry… up…

148
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:01,690
I love you! Please marry me!

149
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:05,406
What?

Thank you.

153
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,372
What's going on?

154
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:28,508
Why is she serving me tea?

155
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,836
I did imagine how it would
be to become a disciple.

156
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:34,582
-Please take me as your disciple!
-Get out!

157
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:38,940
I'm sorry. The abbot is not here today.

158
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,381
I heard you were coming tomorrow.

159
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:44,680
I see.

160
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,778
UNCLE
Did uncle tell them the wrong time?

161
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:49,146
So… um…

162
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,453
Still, I wonder who this person is.

163
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:54,594
What are your hobbies?

164
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,044
A question?

165
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,988
Is she the examiner for the entrance exam?

166
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:01,591
PASS OR FAIL
They brought a woman to the temple

167
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:04,020
PASS OR FAIL
just to test my reaction.

168
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,032
Oh no, this is bad.

169
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,051
I proposed after just arriving.

170
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:10,574
I'll definitely fail this time.

171
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,712
Is… Is anything wrong?

172
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:16,678
She's so cute.

173
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:20,178
What… what's wrong?

174
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:23,620
I just had a bit of worldly desires.

175
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:25,239
Where is the restroom?

176
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,314
The restroom? Outside, to the left.

177
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:33,638
Oh no, what should I do?

178
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,481
The courtyard is so beautiful.

179
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:45,213
Is it here?

180
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,445
You can't come up?

181
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,104
It is a bit hard to reach you.

182
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,492
Hello, Kiki?

183
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:08,960
What's wrong? Listen to me.

184
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:12,559
My blind date came a day
early for some reason.

185
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,686
This is my first blind date.

186
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,799
He started by saying he
wants to marry and all.

187
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:21,123
Kiki, you're the matchmaker.

188
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,107
Then hurry back and help me.

189
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:26,375
Wait, what are you talking about?

190
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:30,535
Your blind date partner
is right next to me now.

191
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,254
Then who is that person…

192
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:37,188
Yuzuki? Hello? Yuzuki?

193
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,245
I'm back.

194
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:41,053
Tsukuyo!

195
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,061
Yuzuki, your blind date is today?

196
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,743
I wanted to get a sneak peek at him.

197
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:48,791
An evil spirit has appeared!

198
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,116
Ah?

199
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,885
Or it could be some vengeful spirit.

200
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,186
What are you talking about?

201
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,298
How could there be…

202
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:02,630
Help… me…

203
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:10,943
Tsukuyo, run!

204
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,867
Evil spirit, begone!

205
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:30,930
This way!

206
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,104
Wh-wh-what is that?

207
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:39,522
I told you there's an evil spirit!

208
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:44,817
It's a misunderstanding!

209
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,392
Where did you go?

210
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,045
Sis?

211
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,519
-Kurage!
-Run!

212
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,464
Kagura, bring me the ink brush.

213
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:11,063
Yes, here.

214
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,837
Miss Mia, what is this?

215
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:16,506
NOZAWA MASAKO

216
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:18,938
NOZAWA MASAKO
This is pronounced Yamato Nadeshiko.

217
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:22,498
Only a true lady who survives

218
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:24,999
in the fiercely competitive voice
acting industry can get this title.

219
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:28,976
This is what we should strive for.

220
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,598
What's going on? So noisy!

221
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:41,074
Wha-what happened?

222
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:47,207
-What's with this guy?
-Oh my.

223
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,695
-Get off of me already!
-I must…

224
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,021
-Kagura, don't just watch, help me!
-… clear up the misunderstanding.

225
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:53,717
So funny.

226
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:55,776
Is this the right time to laugh?

227
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,093
That was Mia?

228
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:03,356
What do we do?
Another victim of the evil spirit.

229
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,788
And we left Kurage behind.

230
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,964
I think he ran straight past Kurage.

231
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:11,166
Why is he targeting us?

232
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,987
What's different between Kurage and us?

233
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:15,914
If there's any difference…

234
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,538
It's a perverted evil spirit!

235
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:28,467
But if he really is an evil spirit,

236
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:31,242
my kick should have
gone right through him.

237
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,075
If I explain it properly,

238
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,173
they will surely understand.

239
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:49,860
It's not like that, I…

240
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,015
She's still so cute.

241
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:55,694
Damn it.

242
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,978
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE

243
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:04,317
You were mistaken for
a pervert, that's so funny!

244
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,895
He came here to practice

245
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:09,074
because of his uncle's recommendation.

246
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:11,832
Yuzuki saw his robe

247
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:16,400
and mistook him for the blind date
partner who should come tomorrow.

248
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:17,427
That's right.

249
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,011
So whose fault is it?

250
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,893
Of course it's your fault,
you forgot to introduce us.

251
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:28,441
I can't believe you could
get your blind date wrong.

252
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:32,674
You said it wasn't necessary to
see the blind date's picture!

253
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:34,873
His uncle is really unreliable.

254
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,433
MEN FORBIDDEN
How could he not know this is a nunnery

255
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,865
and recommend his nephew to come.

256
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:42,779
Nun-nery…

257
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:44,400
So…

258
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,431
Although it was a misunderstanding,

259
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:48,340
I did hit you with a flying
kick and a palm strike.

260
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,412
-I'm really sorry…
-It's fine.

261
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:54,587
But what's wrong with you two?

262
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,954
Well, there are some things

263
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,503
that are intolerable for young girls.

264
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,812
Alright, how about this?

265
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,180
Since both of you are at fault,

266
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:08,851
why don't we let him
practice here for a while?

267
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,339
What?

268
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,248
Are you serious, Kiki?

269
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:13,837
This is a nunnery!

270
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,788
We can just take down the
sign that says 'Men Forbidden'.

271
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,196
Just like that?

272
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,548
You must want it too, right?

273
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,018
Free male labor?

274
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:29,580
But… but…

275
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:31,270
I would like some helping hands.

276
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,465
But it's not okay to have him here.

277
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,615
Be honest, you two.

278
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,353
It seems to be going well.

279
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:41,749
Living with this man…

280
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:43,342
Alright, alright, put it away.

281
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:45,671
Kiki, you'll be in danger too.

282
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,662
This guy only has breasts in his eyes!

283
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,623
Really? Let me try.

284
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,945
Stop it!

285
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,490
This guy just told me

286
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:56,433
that he…

287
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:59,976
lo-lo-lofe…

288
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:01,933
Lofe?

289
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:05,164
Um, thank you very much.

290
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,092
Is it really okay?

291
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:12,843
Yeah, I can't keep
causing trouble for you.

292
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:14,160
And…

293
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:19,178
She probably doesn't remember

294
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,668
our first meeting.

295
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:24,388
Goodbye.

296
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:32,803
Sis Yuzuki.

297
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:35,982
Nyagosuke said it's a pity.

298
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,710
I don't think he's a bad person either.

299
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,230
Maybe.

300
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:46,917
The last bus is gone.

301
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:52,001
What have I done?

302
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:54,953
What should I do after this?

303
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:58,763
Yeah, what should you do?

304
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,773
Ah, like I thought.

305
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,141
This place is in the suburbs.

306
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:11,085
The buses are gone very early.

307
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:16,473
W-What is it?

308
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:22,485
Do you want to stay over for one night?

309
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:26,847
Ah, no.

310
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,833
We are both at fault for what happened.

311
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:32,777
And our temple is quite spacious.

312
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,212
You can't stay long though.

313
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:39,257
I'll persuade the others, okay?

314
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:43,776
Seems like she's a really nice person.

315
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:46,230
Thank you very much.

316
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:51,263
But I want to try my best on my own first.

317
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:53,247
I see.

318
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:57,073
I don't want to use her as
an excuse to avoid the problem.

319
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:01,248
By the way, I was really surprised.

320
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:03,232
So much happened just after we met.

321
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,665
I'm sorry, please forget everything!

322
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,462
How can you ask me to forget?

323
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:11,128
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:14,904
You see, we've only met twice,
and you're talking about marriage.

325
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,475
She still remembers.

326
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,417
What kind of joke is that?

327
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:25,998
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE STATION
Huh?

328
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:31,146
Uh, it was a joke, right?

329
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:35,318
-Um…
-Yeah!

330
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,918
My name…

331
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:38,688
Your name?

332
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:43,089
My name is Akagami Akemitsu.

333
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:46,153
Right, I don't know your name yet.

334
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,377
We were really in a panic.

335
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,129
Let me introduce myself again.
My name is Aoba Yuzuki.

336
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:06,124
Nice to meet you.

337
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:09,803
Akagami?

338
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:13,843
Akagami… Is it…

339
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:16,040
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE

340
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,968
I'll try with all my life to pay back

341
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:23,264
the 20 million yen debt my father left!

342
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:26,035
I'm really sorry!

343
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,440
Alright, calm down.

344
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:30,581
Who would have thought

345
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,112
this guy is the son of the man

346
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:34,479
who borrowed money from
the temple and ran away?

347
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:36,753
Listen to me, everyone.

348
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:38,481
SLAVE
He couldn't possibly

349
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:39,891
SLAVE
pay back so much money right away.

350
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:42,707
But we can't just let
him off the hook, right?

351
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:44,741
SELL AS A SLAVE, SELL HIS ORGANS
So now there are two more humane ways

352
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,091
SELL AS A SLAVE, SELL HIS ORGANS
for him to repay the debts.

353
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,357
SELL AS A SLAVE, SELL HIS ORGANS
Let's take a vote.

354
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:49,199
Sell as a slave!

355
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,095
Sell his organs!

356
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:51,358
If we're going to sell,

357
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:54,272
it's better to preserve his dignity.

358
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,045
He looks like he can
make money for many years.

359
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:59,201
Kurage! What are you saying?

360
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,799
Anyway, after thorough consideration,

361
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:05,698
we decided to let Akagami
pay with his body.

362
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:07,399
Huh?

363
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,506
NEXT EPISODE
(Being Lewd Is Not A Bad Thing)

364
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,298
First, take off your clothes.

365
00:23:49,406 --> 00:23:50,046
Why?

366
