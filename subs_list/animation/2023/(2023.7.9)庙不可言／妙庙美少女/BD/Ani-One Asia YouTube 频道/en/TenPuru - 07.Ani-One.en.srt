1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,994
We are officially preparing
for the ordain beginning today.

2
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:08,298
Are you all ready?

3
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:09,189
Yes!

4
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:12,159
Show that annoying monk a bit of attitude.

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,272
Yes!

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,852
Then let me ask you all.

7
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:17,902
What colors are your underwear now?

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,012
White,

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,868
or other colors?

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,134
Kiki,

11
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:28,107
we don't have much time,
please take it seriously.

12
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,206
I'm quite serious!

13
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:31,591
The so-called practice involves

14
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,041
returning the mind
and body to a state of pure innocence.

15
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:39,335
Even a piece of underwear
has to meet a clear rule:

16
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:42,535
it has to be white and plain.

17
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,494
I don't have white.

18
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,119
And I like to wear boxers.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,144
I've washed mine.

20
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,192
I only have red and black!

21
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,455
Red and black?

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,384
Eh, why are you all so surprised?

23
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,250
Don't you all have white underwear?

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,320
Then there's no choice.

25
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:01,537
No underwear

26
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:04,417
for practice today, everyone.

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,784
WORLDLY DESIRES

28
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:22,376
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,266
(Episode 7: What color is your underwear?)

30
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,250
This is so unsettling.

31
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,376
Such a shameful thing.

32
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,370
Yuzuki, you don't mind at all?

33
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,974
W-Well…Although it is
somewhat embarrassing,

34
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,534
it is simply part of the practice.

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,340
Miss Kiki.

36
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,010
Thank you.

37
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:02,425
You have a very
interesting way of speaking.

38
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,516
First is Zazen.

39
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,628
Assume the correct posture.

40
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,676
Settle your mind.

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,962
No matter what evil thoughts arise,

42
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,606
you must not succumb to it.

43
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:19,252
Those who are not taking this seriously

44
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:20,136
BE ALERT
will get a tap on the shoulder from me.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,032
I am so grateful.

46
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,954
This is the practice

47
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:29,044
I am interested in.

48
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:33,435
Lips slightly closed, eyes slightly open,

49
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,843
and slowly inhale through the nose.

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,232
This is Zazen.

51
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,816
Ignoring distracting thoughts

52
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,567
and focusing solely on the air

53
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:57,423
and the passage of time.

54
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:01,939
This is what they call
purifying the mind, right?

55
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:27,780
What's wrong with you, Akagami?

56
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:29,230
Sit up.

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,752
Next is the copying of a sutra.

58
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,135
NET PROFIT
Copy each word carefully.

59
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:35,527
Copy each word carefully.

60
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:38,855
That was so out of character.

61
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:41,223
There won't be any problems this time.

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,671
Oh. Akagami, you write pretty well.

63
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,962
I used to work in a calligraphy classroom.

64
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,674
Having good handwriting
is an advantage for the abbot, huh.

65
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:54,913
You should go teach Yuzuki to write.

66
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,670
I will leave for a minute.

67
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,042
Miss Yuzuki,

68
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,141
the way you hold the pen…

69
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,230
So erotic!

70
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:13,215
So erotic?

71
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:14,941
I'm sorry!

72
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:16,940
Your thumb should be here.

73
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,732
Oh my. Here's the tissue.

74
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,549
BETWEEN THE LEGS, NO UNDERWEAR

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,616
Let me wipe it for you.

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,840
Miss Mia?

77
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,613
It's okay.

78
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:32,821
It's okay.

79
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,061
Miss Mia, stop! Don't continue!

80
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,987
Why are you only hitting me?

81
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:46,451
Um…

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,912
Today, I've been lagging
behind the whole day.

83
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,550
How should we apologize?

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,616
It's okay, it's okay.

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,736
Uh... Well.

86
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,328
You don't have to worry about me.

87
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,711
You two continue shopping…

88
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:03,580
No, no! It's fine!

89
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,781
I bought white underwear!

90
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:08,815
And a bra too!

91
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,429
I'm all prepared now.

92
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:12,837
Right, Akagami.

93
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:15,077
These two seem to get along quite well.

94
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:18,271
KIDNEY BEAN
Let's rest well today

95
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,711
and work hard tomorrow.

96
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:21,093
Understood.

97
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,188
We're back.

98
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,426
You three will be
sleeping here starting today.

99
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:30,941
When participating in the practice,

100
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:33,565
everyone sleeps on a single tatami mat.

101
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:36,061
Learning to accept this now is harmless.

102
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,941
How can I sleep here?

103
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,688
And it's just the mattress.

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,830
Men and women usually
sleep separately, right, Kiki?

105
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,380
Kiki.

106
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,695
That's the way! That's how you can sleep!

107
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,783
That's right!

108
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,511
You're impressive, Akagami!

109
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,249
What are you up to?

110
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,539
There's no need to be so hasty.

111
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,461
Let her ordain.

112
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:05,107
There will be an internal meeting

113
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,743
about this temple three months later.

114
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,230
INTERNAL MEETING

115
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,278
INTERNAL MEETING
This is a decision from above.

116
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,107
INTERNAL MEETING
Wha--

117
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:18,651
Just please don't

118
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:20,763
nullify my engagement.

119
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:26,087
Geez.

120
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:31,853
We'll just have to beat a dead horse?

121
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:34,472
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE

122
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:42,143
I didn't sleep for a second.

123
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,755
Today we're going to do a kind of

124
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,321
slightly different practice.

125
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:58,699
It's also a reward for
your previous efforts.

126
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,171
A reward?

127
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,226
SAUNA, PRIVATE SESSIONS ARE AVAILABLE, POST-CEREMONY CELEBRATION
Why a sauna?

128
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,210
And why is it mixed bathing?

129
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,799
Aren't you happy?

130
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,823
That's precisely the problem.

131
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,689
This is the only way.

132
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:18,840
Face your own distracting thoughts

133
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,584
while also increasing
your endurance for the opposite sex.

134
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
This is also for…

135
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,064
Um…how should I put it?

136
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:28,639
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Enjoy what?

137
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,850
Cheer up, Akagami.

138
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,616
If this level of difficulty is unbearable,

139
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,048
you will not be able
to ordain in three months.

140
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,447
Yes, Yuzu--

141
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:41,071
I'm okay.

142
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,799
I am too.

143
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,778
My mind is full of distracting thoughts!

144
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:04,293
Can I really suppress
these distracting thoughts?

145
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,575
I-It's a bit crowded.

146
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,566
S-Sorry.

147
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,797
Akagami?

148
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,838
I'm sorry, Miss Mia!

149
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,478
I'm okay, Akagami.

150
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,862
But…

151
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:27,731
I hope you can turn off
the light before doing it.

152
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:30,099
That doesn't look okay at all!

153
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,174
Miss Mia, this won't do.

154
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:35,393
Indeed.

155
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:39,169
We can't keep holding Miss Yuzuki back.

156
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,689
Let's have a meeting.

157
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,861
Let's discuss our progress in practice.

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,680
Y-Yeah.

159
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:48,843
Yesterday, we copied
a sutra and did Zazen.

160
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,051
Sleeping together

161
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,986
is also regarded as practice.

162
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:54,959
Oh, speaking of which,

163
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,711
while sleeping last night,
I noticed something.

164
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,023
What?

165
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:02,287
I like Adam's apples.

166
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,880
Akagami's Adam's apple is bulging.

167
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,800
It's so charming.

168
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,400
This has nothing to do
with enlightenment at all!

169
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,219
Oh my, I'm talking
about such things again.

170
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,285
A-Akagami, how about you?

171
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:19,372
M-Me…

172
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,718
Last night, I stayed firm

173
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:24,558
all night!

174
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:26,255
You're so manly, Akagami!

175
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,383
What am I saying?

176
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,350
Miss Yuzuki's face is all red.

177
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:36,623
Why? Distracting thoughts keep popping up!

178
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:39,245
If this continues,
Miss Yuzuki will dislike me,

179
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:42,814
and my qualification
to ordain will be revoked.

180
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,029
I see.

181
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,710
Miss Kiki's purpose is now clear to me.

182
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,838
She wants us to experience

183
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:54,715
the demonic realm.

184
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,694
Demonic realm?

185
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:00,831
Is Miss Yuzuki fainting from the heat?

186
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:04,095
I-It's all because
of the trouble I caused.

187
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:05,705
I'm okay!

188
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,597
The demonic realm is a term in Buddhism.

189
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,647
In both heaven and earth,
only I am supreme!

190
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,197
Speaking of which, I'm so hungry.

191
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,277
The so-called demonic realm

192
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:14,818
is about entering
a state of extreme euphoria

193
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:18,404
by rigorously visualizing
the troubles and distracting thoughts

194
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,098
that are deep asleep in your heart.

195
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,838
You will no longer

196
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,526
be swayed by distracting thoughts
as long as you can overcome this.

197
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:34,133
This was the experience

198
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:35,691
Miss Kiki was referring to?

199
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,288
Yeah, it should be.

200
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,301
Next, it's Miss Yuzuki's turn.

201
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,180
Come on, Miss Yuzuki.

202
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,485
Let's talk about
explicit sexual vocabulary.

203
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,820
Don't make it sound like
we're telling dirty jokes.

204
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,123
Come on!

205
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,346
Well… I…

206
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,212
Come on.

207
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,754
I can't say it aloud,

208
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,275
but I am fascinated by Akagami's nakedness

209
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:04,349
or a particular part of his body.

210
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:07,585
I can't stop thinking about the naked body

211
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:10,273
I saw in a love hotel.

212
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,384
Not to mention,

213
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:14,214
I also thought about the possible
events that might happen afterwards.

214
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:15,665
I can't say it out loud.

215
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,065
And…

216
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,777
I don't seem to have

217
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,562
any distracting thoughts.

218
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,970
Really?

219
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,538
Miss Yuzuki has overcome the demonic realm

220
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:29,871
and entered the state of selflessness.

221
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:31,847
As expected of Yuzuki!

222
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,245
Um… Yeah…

223
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,895
The practice ended smoothly.

224
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,623
Let's report to Kiki.

225
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:42,969
Yeah, I can't say it out loud.

226
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:44,411
After all, this is

227
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:47,972
a personal matter unrelated to practice.

228
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:51,179
When I see how well they get along,

229
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,838
it makes my heart hurt.

230
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:57,437
I can't say it out loud.

231
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:02,621
Anyway, this is special practice.

232
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,624
It seems to have an effect.

233
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:05,776
Yes!

234
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:08,865
I clearly felt
my own distracting thoughts.

235
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,103
Well, that's the best.

236
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:15,041
Distracting thoughts
will persist toward enlightenment.

237
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:18,953
That is why you must
confront distracting thoughts.

238
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,553
I see.

239
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,730
If someone claims to

240
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,852
have no distracting thoughts,

241
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,218
he or she must be a sulky pervert.

242
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,663
I'm not perverted at all.

243
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:43,784
A COMPASSIONATE PERSON
FINDS JOY IN HELPING OTHERS

244
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,644
You guys have become very proficient.

245
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,460
Thank you for the compliment.

246
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,857
Let's give you the afternoon off.

247
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:08,621
Why, Kiki?

248
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,555
That's right.

249
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,357
The practice has just begun!

250
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:12,716
Calm down.

251
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,430
You will only harm your body
if you push yourself so hard.

252
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,751
But…

253
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,927
Not seeking fame and fortune.

254
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,055
You understand, don't you, Yuzuki?

255
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,209
NOT SEEKING FAME AND FORTUNE

256
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,934
Not seeking?

257
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,284
Not seeking fame and fortune entails

258
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,111
not considering gains and losses

259
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:36,236
and instead facing
one's surroundings and oneself calmly.

260
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,047
This is most likely the third point
of the first experience of enlightenment.

261
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,571
In short, rest is
also part of the practice.

262
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,091
Then I'm going to go play with Kagura.
It is been a long time!

263
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,726
How could it be?

264
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:53,516
There's a day off today.

265
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,611
What's wrong, Akagami?

266
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:59,363
Today is December 24th.

267
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,111
It's also Christmas.

268
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,332
Huh? Akagami, do you dislike Christmas?

269
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,923
Every Christmas,

270
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,905
my father would spend every waking moment
planning how to deal with his mistress.

271
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,380
Every time this happened,

272
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:17,917
my house would
turn into a bloody battlefield.

273
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,227
Christmas is so scary.

274
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,444
Christmas is so sad.

275
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,213
Um…

276
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,397
In that case, would you like

277
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:33,152
to go out with me? Just the two of us.

278
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,916
There will be a Christmas party tomorrow.

279
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,356
Huh? At the temple?

280
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,860
Yes, and also,

281
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,286
there is a gift exchange session.

282
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,968
Let's choose gifts together.

283
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:52,355
Okay, I got it.

284
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:54,397
What's wrong, Akagami?

285
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,878
24TH DECEMBER, CHRISTMAS EVE
It's just too subtle for two people

286
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:58,869
to go out in pairs on Christmas Eve!

287
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:00,917
Especially with Miss Yuzuki!

288
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,060
Christmas songs
and decorations everywhere.

289
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,483
There is a breezy,
carefree vibe all along the street.

290
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:11,057
Damn it,

291
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:12,855
so this is Christmas Eve!

292
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,882
I will never become one of them.

293
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,900
Let's go, Akagami.

294
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,652
Okay!

295
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,496
Over here.

296
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,021
What about this one?

297
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,035
So cute.

298
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:37,785
I was too carried away!

299
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,617
Is this the magic of Christmas Eve?

300
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,840
My practice is far from enough.

301
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,224
Have you decided what gift to buy?

302
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,321
Oh…not yet…

303
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:53,343
I'm struggling with what gift to buy.

304
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:56,671
You do not need to overthink it.

305
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,182
Really?

306
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,084
Simply choose the present

307
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,840
that best expresses
your gratitude to them.

308
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:06,715
I see.

309
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:10,427
By the way, there's a store
I want to recommend to you.

310
00:17:11,784 --> 00:17:14,830
BUDDHIST SUPPLY STORE

311
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,308
-Is this a Buddhist supply store?
-Yes.

312
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,844
This store is opened by my senior.

313
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:21,766
The products available here

314
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,661
are essentially temple necessities.

315
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:25,325
It should be easier to choose, right?

316
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,789
Oh… I see.

317
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:32,205
Prayer beads, huh?

318
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:33,679
Are you buying this?

319
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:36,239
No, I was just thinking
I don't have one yet.

320
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:40,244
I only have a simple one.

321
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,588
Simple?

322
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,885
There are simple and formal prayer beads.

323
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:48,187
For the ordaining ceremony
or other major events,

324
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,752
you have to use formal prayer beads.

325
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:55,192
But they are quite expensive.

326
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:59,469
I could only borrow from Kiki or
my parents during the ordaining ceremony.

327
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,732
Is that so?

328
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,908
I need to get my own prayer beads

329
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,340
and stand on my own two feet soon.

330
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:10,069
Action speaks louder
than words, buy it now.

331
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,879
-Mary.
-Welcome, Yuzuki.

332
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,868
Long time no see. This is Akagami.

333
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,201
Nice to meet you.

334
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:19,199
This is my senior, Mary.

335
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,596
Hello.

336
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:23,863
If you're looking for prayer beads,
I have some recommendations.

337
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:26,815
Love prayer beads for couples.

338
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,262
Huh? There's such a thing?

339
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,248
Yes.

340
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:33,101
After all, in a Buddhist wedding,

341
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:35,857
what's exchanged
are not rings but prayer beads.

342
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,876
Exchange prayer beads?

343
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,434
This is quite obscure knowledge.

344
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:41,149
Others,

345
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,813
such as the one aimed at couples

346
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,298
and the one for husband and wife
to have children and good fortune.

347
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:47,802
Why do you keep recommending these to me?

348
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,106
Aren't you two a couple?

349
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:50,845
Couple?

350
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,412
No, I've already said he's not.

351
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,776
Really?

352
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,746
You guys came here together
on Christmas Eve,

353
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,381
I thought you're definitely on a date.

354
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,202
Uh? Did she just realize it now?

355
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:14,416
Um… we're really not in
that kind of relationship.

356
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,390
Really?

357
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,726
Really no chance?

358
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
Uh, well… I guess so…

359
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,565
But Yuzuki's face is red,
so it looks like there is a chance.

360
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,630
Don't look at me, Akagami.

361
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:29,623
I see that Yuzuki is quite exciting.

362
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,056
Her usual attire is more casual,

363
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:37,185
but she did put on makeup today,
which is unusual.

364
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,354
And it seems
she's gained a bit of weight.

365
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,467
Mary, I'll take this one!

366
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,874
Okay, thank you for your patronage.

367
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:46,525
It's not what you think!

368
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:47,587
PRAYER BEAD HANDCRAFTING EXPERIENCE STARTING FROM 1000 YEN, SUITABLE FOR AGES 5 AND ABOVE.
It's not what you think!

369
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,806
-Alright.
-Geez.

370
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,434
Akagami, have you picked out a gift?

371
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,686
Yes. Thanks to you.

372
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:01,590
That's great.

373
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:04,393
Could it be…

374
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:08,809
Miss Yuzuki is trying to cheer me up?

375
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:12,803
Miss Yuzuki.

376
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,344
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

377
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,224
Me too, Akagami.

378
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,726
It's Christmas again, huh?

379
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:27,222
The year went by so fast.

380
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,958
Speaking of which,
isn't it a bit too chaotic right now?

381
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,390
Indeed, the changes are quite significant.

382
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,554
I have also reached adulthood.

383
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,562
The most noticeable change has to be Mia.

384
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:43,132
It must be the result of her practice.

385
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,454
You have turned into a slutty person.

386
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,810
What did you say?

387
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,673
At first, you had
a little bit of a pure vibe,

388
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,682
NEVER REVEAL SKIN
but now there is no sign of it.

389
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,742
THOSE WHO LEAD A SELF-INDULGENT AND IMMORAL LIFE SHOULD PAY FOR THEIR ACTIONS WITH THEIR LIVES.
but now there is no sign of it.

390
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:54,075
Your outfit has also changed.

391
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,054
Your clothes now
highlight your curves more.

392
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,897
I don't have that kind of thought!

393
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,338
Sorry.

394
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:04,624
This kind of attire suits you,
and it's not for any lewd reasons.

395
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,094
I just wanted Akagami
to stare at my chest!

396
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:09,749
This reason is outrageously lewd!

397
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:11,736
I'm not.

398
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:14,552
Sis Tsukuyo has also become lewd.

399
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,353
What are you saying?

400
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:19,395
Sis Yuzuki is as introverted as ever.

401
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,996
Alright.

402
00:21:26,216 --> 00:21:27,438
In any case,

403
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:30,952
we've all changed because of him.

404
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,512
Before, the four of us

405
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:37,096
even discussed how to drive Akagami out.

406
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,782
There was such a thing.

407
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,664
The biggest change has to be

408
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:43,776
the fact that Akagami came to the temple.

409
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,016
No one would think of

410
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,389
driving him out now.

411
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,250
He really is an interesting person.

412
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,298
Akagami.

413
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,809
But he's also really a nuisance.

414
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:11,767
Let's drive him out.

415
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,196
(Next Episode: Encountering a Turtle Symbolizes Good Fortune)
Question,

416
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:49,180
what's that swaying

417
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:50,780
in the middle of your body?

418
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:53,387
The one that sometimes gets bigger
and sometimes smaller, right?

419
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:54,543
Wait-- Mia?

420
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,625
The one that makes you
an adult when you do it alone, right?
