1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:02,786
Let's have a duel, Akagami!

2
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:06,712
Sis Yuzuki and Sis Tsukuyo have
already fallen for you.

3
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:07,484
What?

4
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,064
Now, I will have to save this temple!

5
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:13,162
Mia, you must be misunderstanding.

6
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:14,526
Don't worry.

7
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,114
At this point, I won't ask
Akagami to get out anymore.

8
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:20,568
If Akagami loses in the duel with me,

9
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:24,386
let's castrate him right away.

10
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:28,664
Ca-castrate?

11
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,257
Is that even an option?

12
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,601
Eh, you agreed?

13
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:38,624
WORLDLY DESIRES

14
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:49,519
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

15
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:07,362
(Episode 3: Let's Castrate Him)
Akagami, watch the house please.

16
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,776
(Episode 3: Let's Castrate Him)
Understood.

17
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,980
Be nice to Mia.

18
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,260
Understood.

19
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:14,611
What does "castrate" mean?

20
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,166
Kurage, you don't need to understand it.

21
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:20,412
You can just communicate
with Mia with your fists.

22
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:22,234
Understood.

23
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,549
We're leaving.

24
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:31,710
Take care.

25
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,995
Akagami,

26
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:39,436
are you mentally prepared?

27
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,674
Yes, Miss Mia.

28
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,266
Calling me by my first name
right off the bat.

29
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:47,397
You are not shy, are you?

30
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,594
I am Mia Christoph.

31
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,762
I moved into this temple before you,

32
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,115
so show me some respect.

33
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,831
Aren't you the same as me?

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,777
The same as you?

35
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,323
You're really rude!

36
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:02,681
-I moved in here
-I am Kagura.

37
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,722
-to study Japanese culture…
-Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,863
Listen to me!

39
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:09,213
I moved in with her.

40
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:12,019
Are you Mia's sister?

41
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,460
I'm her big sister.

42
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,688
What sister? And I'm older than you!

43
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:18,710
By the way, Miss Mia,

44
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:21,094
can we not have a duel?

45
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,247
What? Are you messing with me?

46
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:25,021
Don't tell me you forgot

47
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:27,133
what you did to me when we first met!

48
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:32,189
I hate you the most!

49
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:34,728
So I must castrate you!

50
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:42,763
What I did to you

51
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:44,476
when we first met?

52
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:52,545
Well…

53
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:54,523
What's this?

54
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:57,695
This is Hyakunin Isshu.

55
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:00,579
In the past,

56
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,270
a samurai would choose
one person's head as a sacrifice

57
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,092
THE SAMURAI
to save the lives of a hundred people.

58
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:09,201
This is the duel to
decide whom to sacrifice.

59
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,737
Hyakunin Isshu.

60
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,553
This is a national skill of Japan.

61
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:15,277
Not the Japan I know.

62
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,486
So, let's begin.

63
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:22,631
This thing,

64
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,679
is real.

65
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,111
Quickly, get into position.

66
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,199
My next strike will cut you.

67
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:31,576
This is bad.

68
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:35,288
But I can't hurt Miss Mia.

69
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:38,326
Take this, Akagami.

70
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:42,948
Secret Technique:
Bare Hands Block the Blade!

71
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,384
ABSOLUTE ROOKIE

72
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,268
Eh?

73
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:53,316
Oh well.

74
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:58,723
Her breasts

75
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,155
popped out?

76
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,286
Don't look!

77
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:06,270
Namu sanbou!

78
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:10,430
Did I catch it?

79
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:14,576
These are

80
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,968
such beautiful breasts.

81
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:25,952
Miss Mia!

82
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,307
Oh dear.

83
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,274
So the one who is to be punished

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,770
in the punishment game will be Mia.

85
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,574
Mia is so weak.

86
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,498
It's all because of

87
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:38,504
the chest wrap.

88
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,591
Come on, Akagami,

89
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:42,363
you decide the punishment.

90
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:43,793
Should I?

91
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:46,348
Then let me decide.

92
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:47,648
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES

93
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:51,555
This book contains all
the ascetic practices that ever existed.

94
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:53,925
Choose one ascetic practice

95
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:56,833
from this precious book.

96
00:05:57,777 --> 00:06:00,405
Complete Ascetic Practices?

97
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,455
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES
Look at this "Suffocating Ascetic Practice".

98
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,634
The ascetic practice of

99
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:08,023
blocking all the holes
in the body and enduring it.

100
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,648
-Whole body?
-Yes.

101
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,289
-All kinds of holes?
-Yes.

102
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:16,242
-I'll do it!
-Don't!

103
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:17,842
You don't have to pity me.

104
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:19,203
Please calm down.

105
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,987
There's something I want more than that.

106
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:23,029
What is it?

107
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,905
What I want

108
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:30,237
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES
is that.

109
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:35,872
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES

110
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:38,329
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES
I want that.

111
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:40,758
BREASTS
You want this?

112
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:42,927
Your purpose is indeed lewd.

113
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,808
It's okay. I won't mess around!

114
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:48,087
-But…
-Please, just for one night!

115
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,805
Wait…how can you…

116
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,175
I want to try all sorts of things!

117
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,547
Try? Try what?

118
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:56,184
At least let me have a look!

119
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:58,488
I'm not doing that!

120
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,741
You breast-assaulting maniac!

121
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:01,890
Oh dear.

122
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,312
In the end,

123
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,320
I couldn't reconcile with Mia.

124
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:13,502
I want it so badly.

125
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:16,399
Complete Ascetic Practices.

126
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:21,377
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES

127
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:23,876
There must be
enlightenment tips in that book.

128
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,030
I'm here to end things.

129
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:34,407
Miss Mia.

130
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:38,008
Just for one night.

131
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,575
Let's start the punishment game.

132
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,705
Huh? What's happening?

133
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:48,488
You look like you want to

134
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:49,958
run away.

135
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:52,348
So,

136
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:54,293
I'll let you see.

137
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:56,649
You can do whatever you want.

138
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,389
Hurry up. I feel embarrassed too.

139
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,588
You want it, don't you?

140
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:11,724
It's okay,

141
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:13,826
because

142
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:15,876
this is just

143
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,420
a wet dream.

144
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,601
A dream?

145
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:25,956
I see. It's a dream.

146
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:28,654
So,

147
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,910
no one is watching.

148
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,256
Miss Kagura?

149
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:37,804
KEEP GOING. GO! TOWARD A MORNING KISS.

150
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:40,501
I'm not dreaming!

151
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:43,070
Miss Mia, why are you doing this?

152
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:44,190
You dare to ask why?

153
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:46,190
It's because of the punishment game.

154
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,547
Definitely. I understand!

155
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:50,659
This is wrong!

156
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:53,017
KEEP GOING. GO! TOWARD A MORNING KISS.
I understand.

157
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,613
KEEP GOING. GO! TOWARD A MORNING KISS.
You don't want to give up on Complete Ascetic Practices.

158
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:56,042
KEEP GOING. GO! TOWARD A MORNING KISS.
But you can't sacrifice yourself

159
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,092
KEEP GOING. GO! TOWARD A MORNING KISS.
for that book!

160
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,138
Although the value of that book
is indeed immeasurable!

161
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:04,258
Akagami, what you want is… the book?

162
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,696
Mhm, yes!

163
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:08,910
So, Miss Mia, please don't
do something that betrays yourself.

164
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:11,189
Go away!

165
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:15,976
Oh dear, the reconciliation failed again.

166
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,607
My mistake! This is my biggest mistake!

167
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,688
I misinterpreted his intentions.

168
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,556
I made things worse!

169
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:33,180
Why is there a man
in the nunnery after all?

170
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,878
I should lock myself in the warehouse
and meditate for a while.

171
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:45,473
-Hello.
-Why is it you again?

172
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,630
Miss Kagura told me to come over first.

173
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,886
Kagura!

174
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:52,196
Why are you here?

175
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,052
What does it have to do with you?

176
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:58,921
Eh… no way!

177
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:02,605
The door won't open.

178
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:08,683
It seems that we can't get
out through the window either.

179
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,665
There's no cell phone,
and even if we shout loudly,

180
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,649
people outside can't hear us.

181
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:18,839
Maybe it'll be just
the two of us until morning.

182
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,110
Can you stay away from me?

183
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,132
I found a blanket.

184
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,487
-It's cold…
-I don't want something touched by a man.

185
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:38,025
I'll just leave it here then.

186
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,088
Here's a very strange table.

187
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:43,680
Miss Mia, what is this?

188
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,688
Why should I answer your question?

189
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:52,135
This is called a sutra-writing desk.

190
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,855
It is used to place the heads of those who have
strayed from the Buddha's path for public display.

191
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:57,634
Heads?

192
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,479
That's what Kagura told me.

193
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:03,165
Your head will be
put on it sooner or later.

194
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:06,398
You came into the temple
without knowing this?

195
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,184
I'll give you the blanket.

196
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,442
I said I don't want it!

197
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:15,741
The temperature will drop at night.

198
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,981
-Stay away!
-You'll catch a cold.

199
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:20,363
Don't be stubborn.

200
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,091
I said no!

201
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,508
If you keep coming closer,

202
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:30,416
I'm going to get aroused!

203
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:35,712
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)
NO RISK, NO REWARD.

204
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:38,537
Aroused?

205
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,531
No…no.

206
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:48,194
It's not like that.

207
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:56,568
What are you doing?

208
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:58,418
You'll catch a cold.

209
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:02,961
You should stop being so nice to me.

210
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:16,426
Can you forget about what just happened?

211
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:20,930
And also what happened in your room.

212
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:23,298
Let's just pretend none of it happened.

213
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,549
Forgetting about that

214
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:27,853
is somewhat difficult.

215
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:30,352
Even if you have to tell a lie,

216
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:32,308
at least tell me you'll forget it.

217
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,146
Just now,

218
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:37,166
you seemed a bit unlike yourself.

219
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:41,339
Unlike myself?

220
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,850
Do you have some secrets?

221
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:45,207
There is no secret.

222
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,475
That is the real me.

223
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,019
That's something that's been
haunting me like a curse

224
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:52,707
since I became self-aware,

225
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:54,527
my nature.

226
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
That's why I came to Japan.

227
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,741
That's the reason you came to Japan?

228
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:02,948
Yes.

229
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:06,663
If possible, I hope you can
forget about this too.

230
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,708
My family

231
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:12,025
is known as the "erotic family".

232
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:20,671
Our family has been
prestigious since ancient times.

233
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:22,894
Listen carefully, Mia!

234
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:25,084
Women from the Christoph family

235
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:28,004
must be the focus of attention.

236
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,172
Yes, Mother!

237
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:33,310
Especially the attention of handsome men!

238
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:39,485
Mother is so cool!

239
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,715
We're finally in primary school.

240
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:44,591
I'm so excited.

241
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,992
Can we make a hundred friends?

242
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:48,874
I wonder.

243
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,925
Mia, are you nervous too?

244
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:52,831
Yes.

245
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:54,946
Can I also have a hundred lovers

246
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:57,634
like my mother?

247
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:01,872
Just like that, I was isolated.

248
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,387
By the time I noticed something
was off, it was too late.

249
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:11,054
Everyone was avoiding me.

250
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:17,340
What about having two boyfriends?

251
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:19,238
So erotic.

252
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:20,810
What about flirting with boys?

253
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,527
So erotic.

254
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:24,146
Pillow talk!

255
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:26,311
So erotic.

256
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:29,251
Maintaining healthy thoughts
is really difficult.

257
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,836
Mia, do you know?

258
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:36,206
Zen Buddhism is very popular in Japan now,

259
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:37,106
Zen Buddhism?

260
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:41,056
I'm quite interested in it.

261
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,367
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
After hearing Kagura's introduction,

262
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,763
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
I thought, this is the place.

263
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,906
In Japan, the Christoph
family is not known.

264
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,936
In this nunnery where there are no men,

265
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:54,301
I can certainly become a new self.

266
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,883
But your arrival annoyed me extremely.

267
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:01,167
Isn't this just like before?

268
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:02,820
I was just joking.

269
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,180
It's not your fault.

270
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:10,796
Don't worry. I'll leave this place.

271
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:13,732
Why are you crying?

272
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,821
Actually, my family is also like this.

273
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,497
Your family is also like this?

274
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:24,908
I didn't expect to meet someone
with the same experience as me.

275
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,295
You've had it tough too.

276
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:28,849
Yes.

277
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,945
What an amazing coincidence.

278
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:35,539
No, this is destiny!

279
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:37,763
If it's with this person,

280
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:39,687
I…

281
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:44,743
I really am forgetful.

282
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,135
I'm getting aroused again.

283
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:48,916
I'm having delusions.

284
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:51,184
I must run away.

285
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,872
Whether it's Akagami
or the Christoph family,

286
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,225
I can only keep running.

287
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:01,387
Let's fight together, Miss Mia!

288
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,587
Having a companion
gives me great confidence.

289
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:08,226
Let's walk on the path
to enlightenment together.

290
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:12,706
I will definitely hinder your practice.

291
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,077
What are you talking about?
This is exactly what I want!

292
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:17,779
It's easier for you to say that, but,

293
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,474
you're just craving
for my body, aren't you?

294
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,191
Yes!

295
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:25,976
No, after all, we are
just companions in practice!

296
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:28,116
Even if I get aroused again,
you won't compromise?

297
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,786
We have a common standpoint.

298
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:33,503
Yes, I won't compromise, either.

299
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,095
-Let's work hard together.
-Sure!

300
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,893
I'm here.

301
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:54,610
When did you come here?

302
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:57,692
-I've been here all along.
-Then why didn't you save us?!

303
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:01,180
Alright. You should have
reconciled by now.

304
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,082
Then, how about…

305
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:05,022
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES
Practicing asceticism here until morning?

306
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,612
Sounds good.

307
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:10,661
As long as I have companions,

308
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,556
no ascetic practice is too daunting.

309
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:16,684
-Keep it up!
-He he ho!

310
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,594
Kagura? What are you…

311
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:36,467
Akagami, a bit deeper.

312
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:39,186
I'm going in, Miss Mia.

313
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:43,840
Oh my, such ascetic practice.

314
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:51,000
Move your hand a bit deeper.

315
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:52,614
Alright, Miss Mia!

316
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:55,064
Miss Mia, I touched all these places.

317
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:57,012
Hold on, Akagami.

318
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:58,824
Ah, Miss Yuzuki.

319
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:01,896
What's this?

320
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:03,299
TWISTER GAME
Twister.

321
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:07,848
Men and women in tight clothes
twist their bodies all night long.

322
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:11,233
All night long.

323
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:24,315
What are you doing?!

324
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,489
IN REFLECTION

325
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,096
What happened?

326
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:34,651
Who knows.

327
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:36,379
Are you mad?

328
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:37,796
I'm not.

329
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:40,596
By the way, Yuzuki.

330
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:41,709
Hmm?

331
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:43,705
You seem quite relaxed.

332
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,123
But the blind date you postponed
due to various reasons,

333
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:47,668
isn't it today?

334
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,630
The existence of this temple is staked

335
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:52,808
on your blind date, right?

336
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,547
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
I'm going to be late.

337
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,646
Where's the blind date?

338
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,057
Ryūkoku Temple!

339
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:01,593
Can we make it?

340
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,939
If we can catch the next bus!

341
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,036
Then let's hurry up!

342
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:11,032
The problem is, I have to change
into my kimono on the way!

343
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:13,386
I've worked with kimonos before!

344
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,299
You've done that job?

345
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:18,243
Can you notify the other party
in advance that you might be late?

346
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:19,223
No way!

347
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:22,409
This blind date must be perfect!

348
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,185
Why is that?

349
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:25,490
Actually,

350
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:26,651
we should've

351
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:29,339
moved out of this temple immediately.

352
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:33,609
My parents aren't here and
the temple has no abbot.

353
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:36,586
Without an abbot, his family

354
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,965
doesn't have the right
to stay in the temple.

355
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,931
Although Kiki is helping us now,

356
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,953
I can't ask her to stay here indefinitely.

357
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:47,739
So as soon as I graduate from high school,

358
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,659
this temple will be abandoned.

359
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:53,681
But if my blind date is successful,

360
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:56,049
it would be different
if we could invite a new abbot.

361
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:59,120
Miss Yuzuki, are you going to
marry someone you don't love

362
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:01,352
for the sake of the temple?

363
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,719
It's my decision!

364
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:06,471
I absolutely can't let
this temple be destroyed!

365
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:11,501
We'll make it, definitely.

366
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,677
NO PARKING

367
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,981
I didn't make it.

368
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:18,731
It's too far. I can't possibly
run all the way there.

369
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,887
Miss Yuzuki!

370
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,999
I borrowed a motorcycle!

371
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:23,471
How did you get it?

372
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,252
I'm going to speed up!

373
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,980
Will this work?

374
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,928
When I worked part-time as a deliveryman,

375
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:31,364
I memorized
all the shortcuts in this area!

376
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:34,273
Akagami, who are you really?

377
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:42,028
Out of gas.

378
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,088
BUS
Is that a bus?

379
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,542
Really?

380
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,120
TRANSPORT COMPANY, BLACK SEABASS

381
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,062
I mixed up a bus with a truck.

382
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:58,483
I'm so stupid.

383
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,757
Sis Yuzuki is stupid and introverted.

384
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:05,934
-The Miss Third in my mind, stop talking!
-Useless and introverted.

385
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:08,961
That's not relevant to being
introverted. Stop talking.

386
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,055
Sorry, Akagami.

387
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,551
I had you running around for nothing.

388
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:19,390
I still can't do it, can I?

389
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:21,563
I can't inherit this temple.

390
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,190
Miss Yuzuki,

391
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,672
isn't this a good time to change clothes?

392
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:34,796
Change here,

393
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,971
and we'll go out
when it stops at the next traffic light.

394
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:38,373
But…

395
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,753
After we go out, we'll borrow this truck.

396
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:44,341
Of course, I have driving experience too!

397
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,466
Borrow a truck? How?

398
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:48,305
Just give him some money!

399
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,545
You're already in debt.

400
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,685
It's okay. It won't make a difference.

401
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:55,669
But it will increase your debt,
so I don't think you should do it.

402
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:05,123
I see.

403
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:08,544
Alright! Let's change quickly

404
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,189
and break out!

405
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:11,212
Understood.

406
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:14,863
30 MINUTES BEFORE THE BLIND DATE
I cannot give up!

407
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:45,967
(Next Episode: Go Take A Shower First)
This is bad.

408
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,075
(Next Episode: Go Take A Shower First)
What happened?

409
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:51,329
-Sis Yuzuki…she…
-Did she go for revenge?

410
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:52,771
No.

411
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:56,358
-Lo…love…
-Love hotel!

412
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:57,476
That's right.

413
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
That's terrible!
