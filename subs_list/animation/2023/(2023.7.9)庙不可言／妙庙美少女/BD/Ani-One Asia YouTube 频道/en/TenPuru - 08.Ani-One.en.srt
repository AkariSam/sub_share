1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,700
Although this is a temple…

2
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:06,876
Let the Christmas party…

3
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:13,529
Begin!

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,365
That's what they say, but on the surface,
it's just a year-end party.

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,134
WORLDLY DESIRES

6
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:39,324
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

7
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:57,631
(Episode 8: Seeing a Turtle is a Good Omen)

8
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,142
Today is an excellent day to express my
gratitude for everyone's daily kindness!

9
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,785
I, Akagami, will be the first
to serve the most delicious food.

10
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:07,150
Then,

11
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,990
I'll give Miss Yuzuki,
who has been very nice to me,

12
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,806
the gift I've been preparing in secret.

13
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,681
He said it's delicious food.

14
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,143
It's just vegetables
or something anyway, right?

15
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,420
Sorry for the wait.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,188
Meat!

17
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,448
A-A-Akagami!

18
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:26,975
Where did you get so much meat?

19
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,895
I have some connections
from my previous job,

20
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,263
so I get some for today.

21
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,215
Please marry me, Akagami.

22
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,300
That would be a great honor.

23
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,114
When you grow up…

24
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:40,845
Akagami, stop it!

25
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:43,402
Kurage will take it seriously, stop it!

26
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,030
So everyone…

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,184
Let's eat.

28
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,066
Kurage, what are you doing?

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,964
Eat slowly.

30
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:58,733
We're all full,

31
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,165
so it's time to exchange gifts.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,488
Yes.

33
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,727
It's time. I want to express
my gratitude to Miss Yuzuki.

34
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,620
Miss Yuzuki, what are you doing?

35
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,017
I'm preparing for the gift exchange.

36
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,756
It's more fun to pull this string
and get someone else's gift.

37
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,483
No way!

38
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:20,683
Is the gift exchange random?

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,388
After all, it's my first time
attending this party.

40
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,943
I thought carefully about everyone's gift.

41
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:27,479
Is there anything I can do?

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,784
Everyone, tie your gifts.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,852
TIE IT TIGHT

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,496
Huh?

45
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:37,885
Mia, the concept of "I am the gift" doesn't
exist in traditional Japanese culture.

46
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:39,415
What did you say?

47
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:40,344
TIE IT TIGHT

48
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,169
What are you doing?

49
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:44,815
As a gift, whoever draws me
can choose their favorite organ.

50
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,681
WORTH ABOUT 5 MILLION
It's scary. Who would want it?

51
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,439
So what should I do?

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,744
Me too.

53
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,580
You didn't prepare a gift?
You're hopeless.

54
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,534
AT YOUR COMMAND COUPON, AKAGAMI
Use this as a gift.

55
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,582
VALID FOR ONE DAY, EXPIRY ONE YEAR
-So that's how it is! -I see!

56
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,067
Is everyone ready with their strings?

57
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,411
Yes!

58
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,890
So one, two.

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,160
-It's gloves.
-Ah, those are from me.

60
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,485
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

61
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,518
AT YOUR COMMAND
But I'm more interested in Akagami's gift.

62
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:16,398
What do you want Akagami to do?

63
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:19,233
Tsukuyo, what did you draw?

64
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,321
A little puppet?

65
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,869
That's from me!

66
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:24,063
Ah, thanks.

67
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:25,799
It seems like an…

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

69
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,560
Sis Yuzuki, something's wrong
with this puppet!

70
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,225
It's my turn to open the gift.

71
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,886
Sis Yuzuki!

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,832
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM, AOBA KURAGE
A piece of paper?

73
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:42,735
I originally wanted
Akagami to accept this.

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,168
Kurage, let's have a family meeting later.

75
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:48,719
CAN AGREE TO ANY ONE CONDITION COUPON, VALID FOR ONE YEAR, AKAGAMI
I got my own one.

76
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:49,899
Me too.

77
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,422
Oh, same here.

78
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,106
TEMPTATION OF NIRVANA
Akagami, would you like to exchange with me?

79
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:56,343
What is this?

80
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,255
It's Mia's erotic photo CD.

81
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,481
Kagura!

82
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,992
HEHEHEHE
When did you take these all?

83
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,342
This must be a joke.

84
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,128
Akagami wouldn't watch it.

85
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,594
GULP

86
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,435
Give me that.

87
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:16,957
But…

88
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,903
-Give me that.
-Alright.

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,344
What Yuzuki said was true, I was joking.

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,018
The real gift is this.

91
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,954
What is that?

92
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,898
LUNAR CLOUDS' HOTSPRING, FREE ADMISSION TICKET
A free stay ticket for a hot spring inn.

93
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,698
They are open all year round.

94
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,564
Operating 24 hours a day.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,315
And it's very close to us.

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,245
How can there be such a miraculous inn?

97
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,373
Everyone gets one.

98
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,420
Let's go to the hot spring later!

99
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,417
Thank you so much, Kagura.

100
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:48,563
No problem.

101
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:52,211
I've also been fortunate
to receive your care on regular occasions.

102
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,292
Please do not mind.

103
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,164
Hey, guys there's a cake
waiting for you at the end.

104
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,372
Christmas is the best!

105
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,674
Thank you for accompanying me
to worship Buddha.

106
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,813
It's a small matter.

107
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,476
This is my first time
having such a happy Christmas.

108
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:19,297
That's great.

109
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:23,553
Everyone celebrates Christmas
like this every year, right?

110
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:25,720
Such scenes are rare.

111
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,961
Everyone hasn't been

112
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,648
this pleased in a long time,

113
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,687
since my father left
and my mother went to the head temple.

114
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,102
But the only reason we can smile again

115
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,289
is because you came here, Akagami.

116
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:52,240
It's all thanks to you, Akagami.

117
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,135
Miss Yuzuki.

118
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,729
Thank you.

119
00:06:58,925 --> 00:06:59,885
Um…

120
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:02,131
So…

121
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,329
Now is a rare opportunity!

122
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,473
-This is your Christmas present.
-This is your Christmas present.

123
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,418
Huh?

124
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:13,777
-Akagami, you too?
-Miss Yuzuki, you too?

125
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,049
Can I open it?

126
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,265
I'll open mine too.

127
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,709
Is this the one you got from Mary's shop?

128
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,817
Handmade prayer beads?

129
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:29,169
So we went there at separate times.

130
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:30,705
What a coincidence!

131
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,089
That's why Mary always smirks at me.

132
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:35,775
HANDMADE? HEHE

133
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,502
Let's exchange then, thank you.

134
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,634
Yes, thank you very much.

135
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,620
Exchange prayer beads?

136
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,799
After all, in a Buddhist wedding,

137
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,615
prayer beads are exchanged
rather than rings.

138
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,291
Um…

139
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:04,313
Well…

140
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,186
Why are you all here?

141
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:13,452
Kiki, w-where did you go?

142
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,196
The Christmas party is over.

143
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,598
There was an issue with
your ordaining ceremony, Yuzuki.

144
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:19,893
Issue?

145
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,501
As I thought, with my skills…

146
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,741
No, it's a problem with the location.

147
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,325
The ceremony will be held in the main hall

148
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,911
of the temple
where the practitioner resides.

149
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,493
Many prominent members
of our sect will attend the ceremony.

150
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,550
It's also a sort of inspection

151
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,430
of the temple
where the ceremony is taking place.

152
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,490
The internal meeting may be called off

153
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:46,666
based on the results of the inspection.

154
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,558
But…

155
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,739
TAPE

156
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,843
To renovate the major Buddha statue,
we don't have enough…

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,728
Money!

158
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:02,275
KEY BATTLE
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

159
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:06,339
This is the inn.

160
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:13,163
You two.

161
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,147
You will cross the bridge
when you get to it.

162
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,323
Just enjoy it for now.

163
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,192
Don't worry about money.

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,840
This is a completely free stay voucher.

165
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,677
Is that so?

166
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,403
We can stay for one night.

167
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:26,441
I-Is that so?

168
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,024
MIXED BATH, FAMILY BATH

169
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:34,516
Welcome!

170
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,214
Are you greeting us on your knees?

171
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,616
It's all your illusion.

172
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,520
SOBBING

173
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,927
-Why is the person who appears to be the boss sobbing?
-It's all your illusion.

174
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,652
Alright, everyone.

175
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,992
You can have a soak bath

176
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,504
as soon as you obtain your towels
from the front desk.

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,752
Okay.

178
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,258
Ah, is this the entrance?

179
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,527
I can't remember
the last time I took a hot--

180
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:57,739
What is that?

181
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,084
FOR LORD AKAGAMI ONLY

182
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,711
Should I go this way?

183
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,569
There's even a welcome drink.

184
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,397
Thank you so much.

185
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:13,695
How exciting.

186
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,834
Then I'll take my leave. Huh?

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,832
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,756
THREE DAYS OF GREAT EXPERIENCES,
FUNCTIONAL BEVERAGES

189
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,698
It's okay, Sis Yuzuki.

190
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,896
Let me take a look too.

191
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,524
Please.

192
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,997
I'll only look once.

193
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:36,121
Good grief.

194
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,150
Only once, okay?

195
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,833
FORCE, DRUM UP
Humph.

196
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,119
Sis Yuzuki looks so cute
when she's exerting herself.

197
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,222
How does such a small arm generate
such extraordinary strength?

198
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,470
Don't call it extraordinary strength.

199
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,787
If you chop more wood,
you'll build muscle.

200
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,501
Will Yuzuki become a muscle girl?

201
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:58,983
Should I also start building muscles?

202
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,625
Your chest will also get bigger.

203
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,442
Kurage, watch your words.

204
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,184
Also, if it gets any bigger,
it might be a bit…

205
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,146
SMILE

206
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,383
Then give me your breasts.

207
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,542
Give me!

208
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,716
OUCH
It will be pulled out!

209
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,198
Alright, stop fooling around.

210
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,203
What a beautiful hot spring!

211
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,931
Amazing.
Isn't this a private booking? Great.

212
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,323
This place is so beautiful.

213
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,616
Indeed, it's very beautiful.

214
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,910
What happened?

215
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,842
Mia is really beautiful.

216
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,182
You appear to be an entirely different
person when you let your hair down.

217
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:44,983
T-Thank you for the compliment.

218
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:48,183
You all have Akagami's favorite body.

219
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,588
Thanks for the compliment.

220
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,122
However, it still can't compare
to that person.

221
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,409
What a wonderful hot spring.

222
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:00,625
How does she keep that figure
when she's typically so lazy?

223
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,653
Master, you're amazing.

224
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,166
BUSTY AND BOUNCY
Mia, you're about the same.

225
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:06,929
Ma-Master!

226
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:10,467
Even as a woman, I think
you have a very attractive body.

227
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:12,019
That's not okay, not okay.

228
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,643
BUSTY AND BOUNCY
You can't go down the wrong path.

229
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,830
Alright, alright!

230
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,410
Stop fooling around and soak in the bath!

231
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
You'll catch a cold!

232
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,682
By the way, where did Kagura go?

233
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,969
She constantly takes
her time changing clothing.

234
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,131
Speaking of Kagura,

235
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:36,987
she's always holding a camera.

236
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,907
What has she been taking pictures of?

237
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,783
It's probably something naughty.

238
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,424
Aren't you curious
about why she came to the temple?

239
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:47,171
After all, we don't usually ask
about reasons for ordination.

240
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,964
She has always been by my side.

241
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,642
It has been this way
since elementary school.

242
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,725
MIA
When I was lonely and troubled,

243
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,903
THERE'S A TENT HERE
when I ran away from home after a fight with my parents,

244
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,386
and when I moved to Japan,

245
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,498
she naturally followed me.

246
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,010
Speaking of which,

247
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:11,762
Mia was very honest at first.

248
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,870
I was really nervous when I first came.

249
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,418
Now you talk more than before.

250
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:19,327
Kagura hardly ever talks about herself.

251
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,911
Is she secretive or something?

252
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,626
It's true that I don't know
much about her.

253
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:25,599
But,

254
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,487
as far as I am aware,

255
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,807
Kagura will never betray me.

256
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,431
She is my best friend.

257
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,782
Miss Mia. That's a lovely story.

258
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,750
So why is everyone
in Akagami's private bath?

259
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,446
I was startled and hid reflexively.

260
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:50,356
Now I look like a peeping tom!

261
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:53,257
But I am too energetic now,

262
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,793
I can't get out.

263
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,532
Kiki, am I also attractive?

264
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,236
Uh… hmm.

265
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:02,105
I need to slip out quietly.

266
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:06,057
HEHE

267
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,942
I have been found out!

268
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,260
STARING

269
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,049
It's over.

270
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:14,443
Huh?

271
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:16,367
Sorry for being late.

272
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,788
Could Miss Kagura

273
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
have seen right through everything?

274
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,969
She's a living Buddha.

275
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,046
Now is the time.

276
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,319
By the way, everyone,

277
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:29,583
what would you do

278
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,916
if Akagami was peeping right now?

279
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:33,849
-Then I'll also peep.
-Of course, I'd get angry.

280
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,590
Huh?

281
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,224
Right?

282
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,128
After all, this is an illegal act.

283
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:39,914
It calls into question his integrity.

284
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:43,069
It's an abomination
that tramples on people's trust.

285
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,576
He must be expelled from the temple.

286
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,517
Indeed so!

287
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:53,089
But we need to talk to him first.

288
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,081
After all, it is Akagami, so perhaps
he has something difficult to say?

289
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,664
Right.

290
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,438
Kagura, you still don't know Akagami well.

291
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:07,873
But it's still very embarrassing,
I would probably get angry at him.

292
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,177
Impossibly stupid, Akagami Akemitsu!

293
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,429
Everyone trusted me,

294
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:16,153
but for a brief moment,
I doubted everyone!

295
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,061
Let's go out with a straight face.

296
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:20,917
Everyone will surely understand me!

297
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,050
You all really have

298
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,072
a special bond with Akagami.

299
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,676
There's nothing special about it.

300
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:30,340
A lot has happened.

301
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,441
Very special indeed!

302
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:34,805
All are beautiful things.

303
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,679
Right?

304
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:36,828
Everyone!

305
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,052
Akagami is here.

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,408
Ahhhhhh!

307
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:50,600
Seeing a turtle at the end
of the year is a good omen.

308
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:51,301
A turtle?

309
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,862
REFLECTION IN PROGRESS

310
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,171
Is that so?

311
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:57,091
So this was an unfortunate accident.

312
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,390
Hmm.

313
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,395
But it's also true
that you've been in hiding for a while.

314
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,332
Hmm.

315
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,008
Alright, we should forgive him now.

316
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,184
After all, he came out on his own.

317
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:10,583
Indeed, he did
the right thing in this regard.

318
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,482
And…

319
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,521
SQUIRMING
That was indeed very outstanding.

320
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:18,250
It seems to be more robust than before.

321
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,799
Very manly.

322
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:22,433
T-Thank you.

323
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,170
Should we go back now?

324
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,577
Why not stay for the night?

325
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,073
The temple can't be left
unattended all the time.

326
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,954
Can I stay?

327
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,379
I want to enjoy the hot spring more.

328
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
Then I'll stay too!
I want to explore the inn more!

329
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,675
Hmm, okay.

330
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,875
I should go back too.

331
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,666
Akagami, you'd better

332
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,137
take another bath.

333
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:50,004
No, I should go back to the temple.

334
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:53,513
Are you planning to go back
with your lower half in that state?

335
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,485
I'll stay!

336
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:02,612
The indoor bath is also nice.

337
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,152
But

338
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,017
why isn't it going down?

339
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,351
Do you want me to help you with that?

340
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,122
Hmm, please…

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,321
Miss Kagura? W-W-Why are you here?

342
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,710
-I'll go out right now!
-Don't try to escape.

343
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,260
It's simple to calm you down.

344
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,525
Let me guide you to enlightenment.

345
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,058
Give up your resistance.

346
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,915
Shatter the distractions!

347
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,154
You really can endure.

348
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:53,715
I've thought of a lot of strategies

349
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,083
to get you to lose yourself
in your distractions.

350
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,940
What?

351
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:00,723
Bribing the hot spring inn to set a trap.

352
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:04,935
Giving you an aphrodisiac while tricking
you into thinking it was a welcome drink.

353
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,507
So that's what caused all this!

354
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,599
Now even my beauty tricks don't work,
it's really troublesome.

355
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:14,634
Wait a minute! Why are you doing this?

356
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,478
To exterminate pests.

357
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,504
Huh?

358
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,014
I beg you, Akagami.

359
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:23,474
Can you leave Mikazuki Temple?

360
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,128
I want to implement my plan.

361
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,560
You are a stumbling block in the process.

362
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,457
Plan?

363
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,829
That's why I came to Japan.

364
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,470
For my Lustful Queen Raising Plan.

365
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,475
LUSTFUL QUEEN RAISING PLAN

366
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:40,547
The plan is for Mia

367
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:43,309
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE AT NIGHT
to have sex intercourse sessions

368
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,493
with at least a hundred men
during her stay in Japan.

369
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,737
W-What are you talking about?

370
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,963
Miss Mia

371
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:51,919
is the Christoph family's
next clan leader.

372
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,002
Miss Kagura?

373
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,586
She is destined to become

374
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,484
a prominent leader of the erotic family…

375
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:57,919
Miss Kagura, that--

376
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,446
Didn't you notice
I hadn't finished speaking?

377
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,204
I'm sorry. My mind's not working.

378
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:07,117
I thought this plan would go smoothly,

379
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,269
but Miss Mia and you have reached

380
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:14,059
an agreement on removing distractions.

381
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,065
W-Wait a minute!

382
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,454
Miss Mia is here because
she despises her family's situation.

383
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,286
That's right.

384
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,744
Why did you do it when you knew?

385
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,397
Why do you think it is?

386
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:26,521
What exactly do you think

387
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,937
I am involved in this plan?

388
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:32,375
Miss Kagura, have you always had

389
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:33,527
traitorous intentions…

390
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:36,665
toward Miss Mia?

391
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,668
My friend… My best friend and Akagami!

392
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,111
Should I join too?

393
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,926
One, two, three.

394
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,102
Fall asleep.

395
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,082
Miss Mia!

396
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:00,059
One, two, three.

397
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,427
Kagura… falls asleep.

398
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:08,233
The first thing
I learned was how to smile.

399
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:14,400
My family name is Baldwin.

400
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:20,125
Baldwin is a branch
of the Christoph family.

401
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,456
We do a lot of behind-the-scenes work

402
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,909
for the Christoph family
who get all the credit.

403
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,217
Do you understand?

404
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,932
Not really.

405
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,808
Traitorous?

406
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,101
I was a loyal dog to the Christoph family

407
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,694
since the day I was born
into the Baldwin family.

408
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,337
Then why don't you do this?

409
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:43,089
It's not too late for you and Ms. Mia

410
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:47,057
to fight back
against the family's obstacles.

411
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,387
You are really an interesting person.

412
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,193
So, why are you

413
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,561
working as a temple attendant
at Mikazuki Temple, Akagami?

414
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,018
It's because I have debts.

415
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,387
What are you going to do
after you pay off your debts?

416
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,051
What will you do then?

417
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,132
After paying off…

418
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:08,564
And stay until I became abbot?

419
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,970
Or leave the temple to find a job?

420
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,586
In the end, why did you
come to Mikazuki Temple?

421
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,186
It's because I've always been troubled
by the Akagami family's bloodline.

422
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,078
I want to overcome distractions.

423
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,508
Oh my.

424
00:21:25,212 --> 00:21:27,324
So you escaped from home, didn't you?

425
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,136
Right?

426
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,789
Whether it's Mia or you,

427
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:33,709
you're all just fleeing.

428
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,014
Miss Yuzuki bravely faced her family,

429
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:38,697
isn't that very rude of you?

430
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,013
Um…

431
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:42,893
Let's make a deal, Akagami.

432
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:44,427
A deal?

433
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:48,651
I will pay off all your debts,

434
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,055
and I'll cover the cost
of the Buddha's repairs.

435
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,103
Why would you do this?

436
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:59,069
As long as you leave,

437
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:03,037
Mikazuki Temple can easily
overcome the difficulties.

438
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,986
Please consider it seriously.

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,664
Pound and beat.

440
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,097
Soft and puffy.

441
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,558
Pound and beat.

442
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,980
Soft and puffy.

443
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,458
Pound and beat.

444
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:53,649
Naked?

445
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:55,146
Naked?

446
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:58,445
Soft and puffy.

447
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,844
