1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,756
WORLDLY DESIRES

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,088
TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-

3
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:34,014
(Extra 2: If You Touch There…)

4
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,253
Kiki?

5
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:48,972
Do you believe in God?

6
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:51,020
God?

7
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:53,260
It is not appropriate to
bring this up in the temple.

8
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:55,325
You should now do the oath kiss.

9
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,031
What did you say?

10
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:01,442
This can't be…

11
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,264
Miss Yuzuki?

12
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,144
Whether in sickness or health,

13
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:08,576
Buddha is always with you.

14
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:19,714
I would like to have ten kids.

15
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,813
Mikazuki Temple needs to
be shut down right now.

16
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:35,833
It's useless. There is no such thing

17
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,259
as a white knight to protect you.

18
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:40,124
Yes, there is! Over here!

19
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,384
Miss Kagura!

20
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:57,526
Take her down!

21
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:27,245
Gu…kill…

22
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:28,289
Gu kill?

23
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,735
It's an abbreviation of "Gu, kill me."

24
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,550
I see. I won't allow this to happen.

25
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,336
Oh my.

26
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:42,353
Let us flee!

27
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:53,834
Which way should we go?

28
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,257
Miss Kagura, where are we going?

29
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:02,074
Hold on to me tightly!

30
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,003
Where is this?

31
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:16,694
Of course, it's on the moon.

32
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,706
Nothing will stand in our way here.

33
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,772
It's time for the yearly tribute.

34
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,240
No way, Miss Kagura.

35
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:29,941
I will never do such…

36
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:35,245
Wait. Ah!

37
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:05,921
Akagami, are you okay?

38
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,117
Miss Tsukuyo?

39
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,329
No need to worry about the kissing fee.

40
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,761
It was only CPR.

41
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:34,816
What are you actually talking about?

42
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,505
Forget about that,
do you want to swim together?

43
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:38,828
Sounds good.

44
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:08,681
I'm so happy.

45
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:12,564
Akagami?

46
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,253
Miss Tsukuyo, um…

47
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:16,053
Your breasts…

48
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:24,401
-Hey, Akagami.
-Yes?

49
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,816
Look at me.

50
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,839
-But…
-Look at me.

51
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:31,918
This is able to take off?

52
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:40,803
Do not take your eyes off me, Akagami.

53
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:42,553
Miss Tsukuyo.

54
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,278
Hold me tight. Please.

55
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:49,732
Wait-- Quicksand…

56
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,884
Akagami!

57
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:00,900
Where is this?

58
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:02,631
It is a castle room.

59
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,785
The occasional type

60
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,059
you see on both sides of the main road.

61
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:07,820
LOVE HOTEL
SILK ROAD, BEYOND NIRVANA

62
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:10,672
Miss Kurage, that's not a castle.

63
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:13,414
I adapted to your preferences, Akagami.

64
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:14,389
What?

65
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:20,279
KURAGE

66
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:22,611
How about it?

67
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,151
Do you like this more?

68
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:35,575
Akagami, you really are a Lolicon.

69
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:36,856
I'm not!

70
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,971
Then comes the final blow.

71
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,535
Miss Kurage has become an adult?

72
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:55,815
This is in the way…

73
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:57,776
W-W-Wait!

74
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:00,704
Wait!

75
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:08,663
Don't do this, Miss Kurage.

76
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:10,828
Why not? I'm clearly an adult now.

77
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:12,793
This only happens

78
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:14,710
between two adults who love each other.

79
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:18,257
I really like you, Akagami…

80
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,273
Akagami!

81
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,829
Is it Miss Mia's turn this time?

82
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:27,299
We have had enough talk! I will compete
against you using Hyakunin Isshu.

83
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,007
The setting for the character is back?

84
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,715
Stop there!

85
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:32,509
It's too dangerous!

86
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,813
Go! Akagami!

87
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,660
Go! Mia!

88
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:38,535
What's all this nonsense?

89
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,350
The plot has been crazy
from the beginning.

90
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:43,739
Kiki?

91
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:45,222
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:47,312
Why are you taking off your clothes?

93
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:50,746
If I don't strip, this episode can
hardly be called welfare, can it?

94
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:53,414
Alright, just do what you want. Come on.

95
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,151
Worldly desires, begone!

96
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:58,856
Caught you.

97
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,139
THE JOYOUS ROOM BEFORE ASCETICISM
Where is this?

98
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:07,992
Akagami!

99
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:11,449
Do you like this kind?

100
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,649
This is the asceticism
of love and admiration.

101
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:14,695
LOVE AND ADMIRATION

102
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:17,358
Well, I suppose this is
a form of asceticism.

103
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,301
You should prepare yourself.

104
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,660
Mia, always keep fire safety in mind.

105
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:24,059
Got it.

106
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:25,935
Stay away!

107
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,749
Huh? It doesn't seem that hot.

108
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,515
It's a low-temperature wax candle.

109
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:36,619
You will not get burned.
It is a special prop

110
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:37,887
that is safe to use for fun.

111
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,115
You know too well, huh?

112
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:40,907
Mia, Kagura!

113
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:44,356
Miss Yuzuki?

114
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,279
Oh dear, Akagami.

115
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:47,912
You are filthy.

116
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,917
Can I scrape off the wax and clean it up?

117
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,767
Let it drip on him all over.

118
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,507
Spare me.

119
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:02,531
Shall we go take a bath and clean up?

120
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:03,697
Together?

121
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,975
Akagami, how do you feel?

122
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:18,009
So embarrassing…

123
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:22,051
An adult's body is such a joy…

124
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,283
I don't even know how to wash it.

125
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,545
Don't worry. Just explore with your hand,
and you'll understand.

126
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:30,510
Th-Th-This is not just a distraction

127
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,039
that a punch can disperse.

128
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,211
How does it feel to be
in the pure land of bliss?

129
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:40,976
Mind free from distraction…

130
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,565
Mind free from distraction…

131
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:56,256
No!

132
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:57,848
Stop!

133
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,396
Oh no!

134
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,852
These obscene tentacles
have captured everyone!

135
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,655
Akagami, save me!

136
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,635
Wait! I'm about to…

137
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:17,612
Whose welfare is this?

138
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:23,567
It's really an ugly turtle.

139
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,671
Go ahead…Kill me…

140
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:27,783
I won't go that far.

141
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:53,924
Akagami appears to be very ill.

142
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:56,306
He appears to be having fun.

143
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,951
How is that possible?

144
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,732
He has a fever and has passed out.

145
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:03,190
What caused his sudden illness?

146
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:05,099
Akagami…

147
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,307
Don't worry, everybody.

148
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:09,177
The doctor who checked on him said

149
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:12,098
it was probably just a cold
and that he should rest.

150
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:13,628
Everyone…

151
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:17,167
If you touch… there…

152
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:19,594
What exactly is he dreaming about?

153
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,744
Should we all help Akagami dry off

154
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,651
if he sweats?

155
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:32,293
That is something we must all do together.
We have no other choice.

156
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,498
Right, Kagura?

157
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,479
Akagami's body is identical to

158
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:40,298
what we learned in physiology class.

159
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:44,063
Kurage, you're such a good student.

160
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:45,578
Anyway,

161
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,522
do not tell him

162
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:51,416
that we cleaned every part
of his body together,

163
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:52,261
okay?

164
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:56,346
What if I put it in my drawing diary?

165
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,615
Absolutely not!

166
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:01,814
Worldly desires… begone…
