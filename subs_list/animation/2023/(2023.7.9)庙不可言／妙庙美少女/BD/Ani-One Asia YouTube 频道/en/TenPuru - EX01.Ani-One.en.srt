Th-Th-This…

00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:43,555
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
What the hell is going on?

8
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,746
Why is this Akagami's body?

9
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,299
What's happening?

10
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:53,784
Once I opened my eyes,
I was already Akagami.

11
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,958
It's not a dream…

12
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,924
How can it be so big?

13
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,505
I swear I did not entertain
any sexist thoughts…

14
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:12,024
I-I've turned into Miss Yuzuki.

15
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,724
Breasts…

16
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:16,477
Worldly desires, begone!

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,643
No, no.

18
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:21,640
How could I possibly hurt
Miss Yuzuki's sweet face?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,216
But then again,

20
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,655
she is stunning.

21
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,201
But what should I do?

22
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,985
Kurage?

23
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,963
Akagami.

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,716
Shall we get married?

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,018
I want to make this a reality.

26
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:42,483
H-Hold on.

27
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,303
Akagami, you have been checked.

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,620
Wait, wait.

29
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,770
I am still a child.

30
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,428
Getting caught for what you did to me

31
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,684
would be the end of your life.

32
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:01,442
I said hold on!

33
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,613
Oh dear.

34
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,858
You want to do this to me?

35
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,354
You're really a lolicon.

36
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,027
No way.

37
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,146
What is up? You are acting kind of weird.

38
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:16,346
By any chance, are you Kagura?

39
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:18,205
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE

40
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,416
It seems

41
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,210
everyone's been swapped.

42
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:23,891
Is it possible that
this thing could happen?

43
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,796
This is, after all,
an established reality.

44
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,522
Why would this happen?

45
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,063
Why?

46
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,085
Incense?

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,838
This is from Baldwin.

48
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,625
It seems very suspicious.

49
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,034
Should we burn the incense right away?

50
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,504
I originally intended

51
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:47,931
to make Mia a more lewd character.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,216
Is it all because of you?

53
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,360
You caught me.

54
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,285
Anyway, we have to find everyone.

55
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,525
Surely now everyone is in distress.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,528
We can't let this go on.

57
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,202
Anyway, I have to get dressed first.

58
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,467
Dress appropriately for Miss Yuzuki.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,048
No bra…

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,524
Adult…

00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,083
Akagami, look.

64
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:31,355
VIDEO

65
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:36,695

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,280

67
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,585
Kurage?

68
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,761
You are Kurage, aren't you?

69
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,994
Could you please save this video?

70
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,005
Me… in front of myself…

71
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,225
It is incredible.

72
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:57,391
This Mia has a new vibe.

73
00:04:57,575 --> 00:05:00,113
Kurage, please attend
the family meeting later.

74
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,622
Sis Yuzuki?

75
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,089
Don't you think you should give
some thought to the thing you filmed?

76
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:07,836
I'm Mia now.

77
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,983
Oh well, if it's Mia, we can't help it.

78
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:14,539
Mia claims she is on a diet.

79
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,692
The parishioner has sent

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,344
a delicious Yokan.

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,496
Yokan!

82
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:26,675
No sexy selfies, okay?

83
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,119
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,680
It is admirable
that you can admit wrongdoing.

85
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,459
So I will delete the video.

86
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:33,239
Yaaa!

87
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,078
It's my scream.

THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE

89
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,061
Find a way out of an impasse.

90
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:42,802
This way, I will not have
to witness the stripping.

91
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:47,741
Oh dear.

92
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,533
My, my.

93
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,958
Wait, Kiki, stop it!

94
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:58,089
Nyagosuke?

95
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,377
I see.

96
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,113
Kiki and Nyagosuke have switched.

97
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,539
Could you be

98
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:05,294
Tsukuyo?

99
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:07,319
Are you Tsukuyo?

100
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,414
Don't look at me.

101
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,092
I will never forgive you.

102
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,302
Why are you mad?

103
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,185
Oh dear. What a racket.

104
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,766
It's talking!

105
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,948
What's wrong with the cat talking?

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,485
There's nothing wrong,
Nyagosuke is the cutest.

107
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,125
I am Kiki.

108
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,274
Scratch, scratch.

109
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,912
I am Kiki!

110
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,215
Let's give you some milk.

111
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:36,639
Could you please change it to wine?

112
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,458
I'm talking to her.

113
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,678
As expected of me, that's kind of erotic.

114
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,127
Nyagosuke.

115
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:49,345
You always go to sleep
after you finish your milk.

116
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,989
Ignore her for the time being.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,416
Let us go find

118
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,567
everyone now.

119
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,771
Wait.

120
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,577
What's wrong?

121
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:00,043
Um… Well…

122
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:03,511
Even though I ran away directly just now,

123
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:04,800
but Akagami may also

124
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,291
have exchanged with someone.

125
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:11,900
WC

126
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,859
What are you guys doing?

127
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,966
What should I do?

128
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,890
I cannot keep going like this.

129
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,597
I need to get dressed quickly.

130
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,475
Miss Yuzuki

131
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,882
looks best in…

132
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,974
Kimono?

133
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,031
But if I wear a kimono…

134
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,674
Down there…

135
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,405
So shy.

136
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,167
Temporary illusion,
just temporary illusion.

137
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,407
This must be my temporary illusion…

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,520
It's reality.

139
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,796
Mia?

140
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,938
Surely you must be Mia.

141
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,115
Are you Miss Yuzuki?

142
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,429
Thank God, you're okay.

143
00:07:57,725 --> 00:08:00,029
Everyone else appears to
have swapped as well.

144
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,105
I myself am here too.

145
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,730
I'm Kurage.

146
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,230
I'm Kagura.

147
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,377
What's that for?

148
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,604
We had a dangerous situation to handle.

149
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,565
That is quite impressive!

150
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,794
Kiki.

151
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,085
Master?

152
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,506
I would like to be hit
by a meow punch as well!

153
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,954
Stop! That's my body!

154
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:23,255
What exactly does "impressive" mean?

155
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,136
Kurage, stop asking.

156
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,569
Rather,

157
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,428
we need to gather everyone.

158
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,328
Miss Yuzuki,

159
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,911
you are the only one
who has not been found.

160
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,495
Crap! You've swapped with Akagami!

161
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,417
It is likely that Akagami went someplace

162
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:39,793
like a bathroom.

163
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,875
Your worries will naturally vanish

164
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,731
if you clear your mind
of all distractions!

165
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,899
I am not

166
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,544
Akagami Akemitsu right now,

167
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:47,907
I am Miss Yuzuki.

168
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,946
I am Miss Yuzuki, the most
wonderful woman on the planet.

169
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:53,919
So there are no distractions for me!

170
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:56,465
Sis Yuzuki is also quite lustful.

171
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,306
Please do not show up
at this time, Miss Kurage.

172
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,832
Introverted Sis Yuzuki, huh.

173
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,535
I am not going to let you do
whatever you want, distractions.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,536
I'm not mature anymore.

175
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,219
That is to say…

176
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,260
We have changed back.

177
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,296
You guys.

178
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,332
Master?

179
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,071
How is it? Have you all changed back?

180
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,299
How about you?

181
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,978
You are still a little like a cat.

182
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,627
Meow meow.

183
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,238
Stop making fun of me.

184
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,516
It appears that the effect
fades with time.

185
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,570
So I will have to think carefully
about how to use it.

186
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:50,050
Akagami, where's Sis Yuzuki?

187
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,280
Just now you exchanged
with Sis Yuzuki, right?

188
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,149
Then you should know where she is.

189
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,978
Um… Hmm…

190
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,816
Well.

191
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,525
I have been in her room the whole time…

192
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,944
Let's go, everyone.

193
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,227
W-Wait!

199
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,312
And why am I immobilized?

200
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,513
I'm very sorry, Miss Yuzuki.

201
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,737
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
Ah!
