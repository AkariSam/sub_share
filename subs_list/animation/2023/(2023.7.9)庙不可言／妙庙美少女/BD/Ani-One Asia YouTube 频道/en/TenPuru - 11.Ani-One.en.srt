1
00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:03,004
There are many steps to becoming an abbot.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,908
Before entering the practice site,

3
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:06,898
one must first be ordained.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,906
Ordain is learning the scriptures
and rituals with the master.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,242
To become an official monk is,

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,036
in essence, to abandon all things worldly.

7
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,435
Yuzuki hasn't been ordained yet.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,948
Like yourself, she hasn't abandoned
the secular world.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,426
Originally, she could be ordained
after studying with me for a year.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,268
But Yuzuki completed everything
in just half a year,

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,826
and she didn't fall behind in her studies.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,700
She's trying to become
an abbot as soon as possible.

13
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,956
Could you get ordained in three months?

14
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,533
If you can't do it…

15
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:48,472
Please allow me to cancel the engagement.

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,737
Yuzuki, there is a problem
with your ordaining ceremony.

17
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:56,189
The ordaining ceremony is held
at the temple where the practitioner is.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,032
That's the main hall of this temple.

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,966
Dignitaries will also attend the ceremony.

20
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,167
It's also a kind of inspection
of the temple

21
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:08,782
where the ceremony is taking place.

22
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:12,489
TAPE

23
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,551
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
We don't have a budget for

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,620
restoring the main Buddha statue!

25
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,969
As you can see…

26
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:27,977
If we are to hold
the ordaining ceremony here,

27
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:30,025
we must first restore
the main Buddha statue.

28
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,623
We need to at least figure out how to
fix the broken neck of the main Buddha.

29
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,994
Despite my best efforts,

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,952
the restoration

31
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:41,896
will cost at least half a million Yen.

32
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,294
This is a substantial sum of money.

33
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:49,494
I'm sorry for not noticing it sooner.

34
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,555
No problem.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,725
I will figure it out.

36
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,899
Do you have any ideas, Miss Yuzuki?

37
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,813
If I think it's okay, it will be okay.

38
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:06,204
Is your mind really this dimwitted now?

39
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:08,263
Are you listening, Yuzuki?

40
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:09,733
It's half a million Yen!

41
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,193
That is not money
you can pull out of thin air.

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,726
Our temple is always short
of money and manpower,

43
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:17,642
so we can't even maintain
the main hall properly.

44
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,981
Mr. Houan is very clear about this.

45
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,203
He even asked for ordainment
within three months,

46
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:26,665
despite knowing the situation well.

47
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:29,275
If we can't do it,

48
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,858
we can't beat reality.

49
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,102
Leave it to me, Kiki. Akagami.

50
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,612
After all,

51
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,586
I am going to

52
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,725
inherit the Mikazuki Temple.

53
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,653
WORLDLY DESIRES

54
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:59,264

(Episode 11: The Body is Very Honest)

56
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:16,671
(Episode 11: The Body is Very Honest)
Sure enough.

57
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,544
This is still too big of a burden to

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,956
put on Miss Yuzuki by herself.

59
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,275
PART-TIME JOB RECRUITMENT

60
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,812
FREE REGISTRATION OF CONTACT

61
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:31,279
Registering contact, huh?

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,756
I can't put the temple's
contact information here

63
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:36,373
because I can't
let everyone know about this.

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,968
A mobile phone? I don't have one.

65
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,998
Anyway, I'll try to borrow one.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,232
Miss Yuzuki, are you free now?

67
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,950
Huh? Akagami?

68
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,891
-Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

69
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:02,849
Sorry for the wait.

70
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,703
What do you need at this late hour?

71
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,503
Don't just stand there.

72
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,916
Why don't you come in?

73
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,441
So,

74
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,616
what brings you here?

75
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,282
This is…

76
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,087
A situation where I can't
make any comments, right?

77
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,438
This is… a maid outfit, isn't it?

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,554
Why does she look the same as usual?

79
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,995
What's wrong, Akagami?

80
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,266
Oh, it's nothing!

81
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,609
Calm down.

82
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,987
I just came to borrow a mobile phone.

83
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,124
In fact, I need to ask a favor of you.

84
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:52,321
A favor?

85
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:55,911
What can I do for you, master?

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,208
Don't be shy, just tell me.

87
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,655
Mobile… mobile…

88
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,513
How can I serve you?

89
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,520
Mobile… Mobile phone.

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,456
Can I borrow your mobile phone?

91
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:09,813
Sure, are you okay?

92
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:13,043
I can't seem to get
this fantasy out of my head.

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,440
If this continues,
I won't be able to hold on.

94
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,898
A mobile phone? Let me find it.

95
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:21,007
Huh? Where has it fallen?

96
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,063
Oh, it really fell down there.

97
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:30,989
I'm almost… reaching it…

98
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,290
I found the mobile phone, Akagami.

99
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,569
Why are you bleeding so profusely?

100
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:38,329
Are you okay? You look strange.

101
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,966
You should look in the mirror.

102
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,913
What are you going to do
with the mobile phone?

103
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,848
Can you also lend me your phone number?

104
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,455
I need to fill in a contact number
for the part-time job.

105
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,038
I finally achieved my goal smoothly.

106
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,663
Miss Yuzuki?

107
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,822
Akagami, what are you wearing now?

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,689
Is she playing dumb?

109
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,820
Is she waiting for me
to comment on her maid outfit?

110
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,030
Can't figure out, anyway I'll just say it.

111
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,996
This is a work uniform.

112
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:28,577
That's right.

113
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,473
A work uniform is the proof
that you are practicing.

114
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,009
So, shouldn't you
put aside the part-time job

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,868
and focus on your practice?

116
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,056
But I want to

117
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:41,868
earn some money to repair
the main Buddha as much as possible.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,472
I'll work part-time,
so you don't have to worry.

119
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,623
Aren't you also
in the middle of your practice?

120
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,711
And it's still not easy
for a high school student

121
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,464
to work part-time
and earn half a million yen

122
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,958
in a short amount of time.

123
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:52,949
No problem.

124
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,103
I plan to work five
or six jobs at the same time.

125
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,992
Is this what you mean by "no problem?"

126
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:59,656
She's far too stupid.

127
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,197
There will always be a way.

128
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,662
Let's at least ask everyone for help--

129
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:04,392
Akagami,

130
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,890
this matter arose because of me.

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,384
I don't want to trouble everyone.

132
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,057
That's not my intention.

133
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:13,799
Miss Yuzuki.

134
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:15,919
And my mother

135
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,189
did it all by herself.

136
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,837
Miss Yuzuki's mother is Tsukina,

137
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,411
whom Miss Tendo previously mentioned.

138
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,612
Don't worry, Akagami.

139
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,212
I will find a solution.

140
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,383
What exactly are you going to do?

141
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,047
Well…

142
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,178
How about I double
the number of part-time jobs?

143
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,637
As expected, Miss Yuzuki can't do it.

144
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,247
Are you an idiot?

145
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,396
What?

146
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,248
Leave it to me, who has
tons of part-time job experience.

147
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:51,545
You're saying this while watching,
Akagami, and that's not convincing!

148
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,435
Shoot! I can't look her in the eye.

149
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,057
Have I become so stupid
that you can't look at me anymore?

150
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,131
No, it's not like that.

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,304
So you dare not look at me, aren't you?

152
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:03,296
This proves that I am right.

153
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,861
Then I'll handle this.

154
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,100
I have no choice!

155
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,615
Miss Yuzuki,
you should not dress like that!

156
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:17,431
Wow, no way!
I've been wearing this all along.

157
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,422
You're dressed in clothes
that appeal to my tastes,

158
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:21,618
making you the sexiest person
on the planet.

159
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,684
Your stunning beauty
just appears in front of my eyes

160
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:24,772
when our gazes meet.

161
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,695
Akagami, you idiot!

162
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:28,139
This is so embarrassing.

163
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,505
There's a reason for this.

164
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,689
My mind is racing with
the thought of being served by you.

165
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,172
Please, listen to me.

166
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:36,385
So you're saying

167
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:40,106
that this maid outfit is the uniform
at your friend's part-time job?

168
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,427
She invited you to work there together,

169
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,868
so you borrowed
the uniform to see if it fit.

170
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,107
Then you dozed off
in the clothes until I'm here.

171
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,411
I'm sleep-deprived.

172
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,644
I'm too tired because I've been
looking for part-time work recently.

173
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,033
Aren't you already very tired?

174
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,772
I'm not very tired!

175
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:07,471
Do you want to keep pushing yourself?

176
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,641
I'm not tired at all!

177
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,157
Your dress is evidence of exhaustion!

178
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,444
-Let's have a contest then!
-What?

179
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:20,289
Let's see if I'm really very tired!

180
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,740
If you can put me to sleep,

181
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,144
you win.

182
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,469
Put you to sleep?
How do I put you to sleep?

183
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,529
Like a massage?

184
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,258
Me? Serve the maid?

185
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,293
-Please.
-Really?

186
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,686
Isn't this inappropriate?

187
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,445
I'm already unable to control
myself just by looking at you.

188
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,203
I can't imagine what would happen
if I touched you.

189
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:42,553
What's wrong, Akagami?

190
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,047
Have you already conceded defeat?

191
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,484
Then I won't lend you my phone.

192
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:53,839
I'm really sorry then.

193
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,467
You look quite energetic, Akagami.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,368
But I've been practicing for a long time.

195
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:04,782
What?

196
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:07,652
Foul play.

197
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:09,491
Why are you so skilled?

198
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,880
This touch coupled with this reaction…

199
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,435
Not there.

200
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,840
You have indeed accumulated
a great deal of exhaustion.

201
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:22,169
Your body is very honest, Miss Yuzuki.

202
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,923
To promote lymphatic circulation,

203
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:27,227
begin by pressing
from the neck to the scapula.

204
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:32,771
Then stretch the lower body to allow blood

205
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:35,270
to circulate throughout the body.

206
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,132
Whoa, that side of your breast
is totally out there.

207
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,231
I just accidentally touched it.

208
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,859
Don't forget
the buttocks and thighs either.

209
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,216
You have to massage the whole body.

210
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,562
Lymph, lymph, lymph, lymph.

211
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:52,969
Akagami.

212
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,613
If I don't hurry, my sanity will vanish!

213
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,224
No.

214
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,188
This is way out of line.

215
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,655
Akagami! You finally…

216
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,887
Are you guys wrestling?

217
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,032
I held on.

218
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,785
Why are you dressed as a maid, Sis Yuzuki?

219
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,395
That's a long story, Tsukuyo.

220
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,044
Looks like I won.

221
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,484
See, I'm not tired at all.

222
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:48,665
Miss Yuzuki, don't force yourself.

223
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,090
I'm fine on my own.

224
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,784
Why are you so stubborn?

225
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,396
I've said it all.

226
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:56,749
Forget it!

227
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,693
This has nothing to do with you, Akagami!

228
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:06,621
Is that so?

229
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:09,215
Akagami--

230
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:12,795
Don't be concerned with
what I, an outsider, am doing.

231
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:14,747
-Miss Tsukuyo!
-Yes.

232
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:16,987
Could you keep me company for a bit?

233
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,584
Let's go out tomorrow.

234
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,439
Huh? Company?

235
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:31,552
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)
HAVE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE

236
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,426
Miss Tsukuyo,

237
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:39,900
please go out with me.

238
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:40,993
What?

239
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,914
And then please marry me.

240
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:44,929
Marry…

241
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,242
Then we should be sharing a room soon.

242
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,838
Sharing a room!

243
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,763
Lastly, let's have a child!
Let's have many, many children!

244
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:54,175
No way!

245
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:00,449
At your disposal for punishment.

246
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:02,809
Dessert buffet for three times.

247
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,105
Can it be reduced to twice?

248
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:06,115
No.

249
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,054
As you wish.

250
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,956
Was he trying to confess to me yesterday?

251
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,470
Could you keep me company for a bit?

252
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,696
He even invited me on a date.

253
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:28,088
When did Akagami fall for me?

254
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,811
This isn't another
misunderstanding, is it?

255
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,016
Very likely.

256
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:37,936
It's definitely like that.

257
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:42,038
I won't be fooled again.

258
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:46,227
Alright!
I'll just be dressed casually. Relax.

259
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:49,207
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE

260
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:54,477
FAVORITE KNITWEAR

261
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,958
FAVORITE SKIRT

262
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:00,160
BRAND NEW SHOES

263
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:04,192
GOES ALL OUT WITH THE MAKEUP
THAT SHE PRETENDS SHE DIDN'T PUT ON

264
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:09,030
I didn't put in much effort.

265
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,483
After all, I rarely venture out
on my days off.

266
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,872
I can't just be dressed casually.

267
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,530
Sorry to keep you waiting.

268
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,133
Sorry, Miss Tsukuyo.

269
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,851
The morning practice delayed me.

270
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,083
AS USUAL

271
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,334
Look. I knew it.

272
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,514
Still in his work uniform.

273
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,690
There's no dating atmosphere at all.

274
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,028
I definitely misunderstood.

275
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:41,060
Huh?

276
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,406
Miss Tsukuyo,
you look especially beautiful today.

277
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,812
Having such a beauty accompanying me,

278
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,750
I'm a bit nervous.

279
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,122
I haven't agreed to accompany you yet.

280
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,557
Huh? You don't want to accompany me?

281
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,618
No, no, I need to calm down.

282
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,689
I can't overthink it.

283
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,145
Then let's set off quickly.

284
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:08,425
So you're willing to accompany me again?

285
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,353
Where are you going?

286
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,052
I'm going to the mobile phone store.

287
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,474
So I was hoping
Miss Tsukuyo could guide me.

288
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,752
Oh, you lost your phone.

289
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,224
Anywhere else?

290
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,360
No.

291
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:24,934
Miss Tsukuyo,
is there anywhere you want to go?

292
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,812
No, either.

293
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,916
It just happens to be a free day today.

294
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,862
No other places, understood.

295
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,033
I'm just a navigation tool.

296
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,742
Have you picked a model?

297
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:42,949
Yes, I want to get
the cheapest model possible.

298
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,522
How about this package?

299
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,531

Couples who…live…

302
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,130
Aren't we living together?

303
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,289
But we're not a couple!

304
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,581
MOBILE PHONE STORE

305
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,814
This package can't be
used with minors, you know.

306
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,449
Is that so?

307
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,108
Of course.

308
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,344
How about this package?

309
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,030
It allows you to have long calls
with important people.

310
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:18,619
AFFORDABLE PACKAGE
Oh, this one is quite cheap too.

311

Let's go with this one then.

312
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,542
Let's use points
to exchange for the phone.

313
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,077
Okay.

314
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,045
Please wait a moment.

315
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,929
Oh, this is terrible!

316
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,258
The shopkeeper has completely
misunderstood our relationship.

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,074
Is he beating around the bush to bully me?

318
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:47,165
Whatever, I'm going back.

319
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,322
Here you go, thanks for today.

320
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,349

You like this juice, don't you?

322
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,736
Huh? Did I get it wrong?

323
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,898
No. You didn't.

324
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,596
Right?

325
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,810
What is it?

326
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:07,665
After all, he has been
keeping a close eye on me.

327
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,713
Damn Akagami.

328
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,354
Alright.

329
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,874
Let's go home before it gets dark.

330
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,666
Miss Tsukuyo?

331
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,391
It was my misunderstanding.

332
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,186
Everything was my misunderstanding.

333
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,514
Akagami's confession,

334
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:36,586
today's date,

335
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,426
and my desire to stay with him longer.

336
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,365
These were all my misunderstandings.

337
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,309
Um, Akagami.

338
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,657
Hmm?

339
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:50,685
Uh…

340
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:53,373
I…

341
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:55,761
What should I say?

342
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:57,471
Can I?

343
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,511
Can I really say it?

344
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,091
WHOOSH
Let's exchange… numbers.

345
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,399
My pleasure!

346
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:14,999
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
Today,

347
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:17,857
I'll let you off.

348
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,920
MY PHONE CARD, MISS TSUKUYO

349
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,904
What are you whooping about?

350
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:28,343
This is my first time exchanging
numbers with a girl.

351
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,780
Huh, really?

352
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,812
Everyone else would have fled
if they had heard the name Akagami.

353
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,572
I-Is that so?

354
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,451
I'm the first girl, huh.

355
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,370
Don't think about it.
It doesn't mean anything.

356
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,560
You're lucky, there are all girls here.

357
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:47,672
You'll exchange numbers
with others too, right?

358
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,066
Then you'll have a lot
of girls' contact information.

359
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,228
That's true.

360
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,240
Didn't you buy this phone for that?

361
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:58,007
Uh… well…

362
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,722
I wanted to… have some secret contacts.

363
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,616
SECRET…
Secret…

364
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,219
I'M THE ONLY CONTACT HE HAS

365
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,325
PLUS

366
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:08,975
SECRET CONTACT

367
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,028
EQUALS

368
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:12,627
Are you asleep?

369
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,038
Not yet.

370
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,741
Do you want to meet now?

371
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,718
Hmm…

372
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:18,607
Miss Tsukuyo.

373
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,661
No, Akagami.

374
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,789
Everyone is still awake.

375
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,964
Then let's do it in front of them.

376
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:28,352
Share a room!

377
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:30,869
BOOM

378
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,375
Oh! I've definitely misunderstood again!

379
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,353
Huh? What was misunderstood?

380
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,336
ONE NEW MESSAGE

381
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,358
You helped me a lot today.

382
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,517
I really like this phone.

383
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,225
Thank you very much

384
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,303
for today.

385
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,722
I LIKE YOU

386
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:05,819
I can't get enough of this.

387
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:44,112
Oh, I overslept.

388
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:46,897
Good morning, Akagami.

389
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,030
Miss Tsukuyo, you're just in time.

390
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:53,592
Let's break up.

391
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:58,794
Actually, I'm already tired
of sharing a room with you, Miss Tsukuyo.

392
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,074
Share a room!

393
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:01,947
I am not dating you.

394
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,120
I must be dreaming again.

395
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,894
Goodbye, Miss Tsukuyo.

396
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,068
I'm going to spend the night
with her from now on.

397
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,040
HAHAHA
Akagami, who is she?

398
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,743
What's this background?

399
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:21,353
You don't need to be
as calm as if you're on duty!

400
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,393
OUCH
Kurage, what is that?

401
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:33,357
Shocking Prank Brick.

402
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,628
OUCH OUCH OUCH

403
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:38,048

If you could be gentler,

404
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:40,274
LOW BATTERY
I would be happier.

405
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:42,127

Good morning.

406
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:46,299

Question.

407
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:49,589
Things that one person can't do, like?

408
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:50,891
Kissing.

409
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,383
Getting married.

410
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,741
Hugging.

411
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:54,885
Sex.

412
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,654
Geez.

413
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,123
You're full of distractions.
