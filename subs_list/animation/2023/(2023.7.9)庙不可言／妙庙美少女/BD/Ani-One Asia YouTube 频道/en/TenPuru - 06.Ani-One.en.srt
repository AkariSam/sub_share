1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,142
My name is Aoba Kurage.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,814
I'm about to enter high school

3
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:11,697
and become a remarkable adult woman.

4
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:16,059
But I still want to develop myself.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,146
This little guy is Nyagosuke.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,466
Keeping a diary is a sign of adulthood.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
It's the first step

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,264
to reflect on oneself for growth.

9
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:33,577
Sis Kiki once said,

10
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:37,899
the most important thing recently

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,300
is that Akagami came to our temple.

12
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,269
I'm so dizzy…

13
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:49,227
Are you okay?

14
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,243
He was very gentle to me.

15
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,507
It must be because

16
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,288
he treated me like an adult woman.

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,789
I'm an adult!

18
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:08,899
Finished…

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,498
I can take another step forward now.

20
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,811
Speaking of which,

21
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,957
Akagami really is an incredible person.

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,114
Since he came,

23
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:26,501
our family has gradually changed

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,234
…in a good direction.

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,572
As long as he is here,

26
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,057
I don't have to worry about
what to write in my diary anymore.

27
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:40,205
Kurage, dinner is ready.

28
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:44,419
Coming.

29
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:51,962
WORLDLY DESIRES

30
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,133
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

31
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,681
A bath feels so good.

32
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,666
(Episode 6: Let's Establish Facts)

33
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:39,087
Now the girls' meeting starts.

34
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,833
The atmosphere is so solemn.

35
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:43,895
Every time after I take a bath,

36
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:46,892
I weigh myself.

37
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,258
I found that the scale is cursed.

38
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,410
Yes, the manifestation of the curse is,

39
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:58,251
the number shown is
much higher than expected.

40
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,495
-So you just gained weight.
-And what's amazing is,

41
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,300
this only started happening
after Akagami came.

42
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,860
DELICIOUS MEAL

43
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,655
ONE MORE BOWL

44
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:14,760
-I'll have one more.
-Me too.

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,590
I bet some of you here have
also been hit by the same curse.

46
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,456
This is indeed a curse, Sis Yuzuki.

47
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,746
It's a curse.

48
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,153
I'm glad you understand.

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,289
So let's discuss how to lift the curse.

50
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,292
-I know!
-Please say it, Mia.

51
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:39,349
How about buying a new scale?

52
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,942
Mia, this is a serious discussion.

53
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,954
This is no time for jokes.

54
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,894
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,017
Kagura.

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,434
Let's continue our discussion
about losing weight…

57
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,271
No, about breaking the curse.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,536
-I know!
-Please speak, Mia.

59
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:01,968
How about controlling your sugar intake?

60
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,396
A CHANCE FOR REDEMPTION

61
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,894
I heard that altering your diet to
primarily vegetables and meat

62
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,159
can help you lose weight quickly.

63
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,249
We're broke…

64
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:13,792
We can't afford meat…

65
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:17,241
And the price of vegetables
has gone up recently…

66
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:20,105
I'm truly sorry.

67
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,409
-I know.
-Please speak, Tsukuyo.

68
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:24,841
Maybe some exercise?

69
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,663
It has come to this after all.

70
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,479
I want to try Pilates.

71
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,202
I see.

72
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:35,442
It's hard to stick with it alone.

73
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:37,554
But if we all work together,
it shouldn't be a problem.

74
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:40,393
We'll start tomorrow morning.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,182
It's actually quite challenging.

76
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,606
That's how you work your inner muscles.

77
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,258
ENDURING PILATES
Enduring… Pilates.

78
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:06,649
This is… exercise for adults…

79
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,903
Eh?

80
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,076
I'm going to chop wood.

81
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,841
I need to prepare for club activities.

82
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,625
I'm going to do laundry.

83
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,984
Ah, I'll help you.

84
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:31,366
I thought about that…

85
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,415
But don't we already get
enough exercise in our daily lives?

86
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:36,955
Indeed.

87
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,111
Yeah.

88
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,574
Kagura, why don't you give it a try?

89
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,542
I'm already an adult.

90
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,913
And I'm quite happy with my physique.

91
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:48,228
-As expected of an adult…
-So cunning.

92
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:53,353
Is there… only one solution left?

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,472
We have to diet.

94
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:00,147
Ugh!

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,144
DIET

96
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,741
Wait a second!

97
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,881
But there's no other way!

98
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:09,475
I know that.

99
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:12,553
But a diet would require
cooperation from Akagami, right?

100
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,166
That's correct…

101
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,560
It's a temple rule.

102
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:17,750
We can't waste the food we make.

103
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:19,723
Given this rule,

104
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,939
we can only ask Akagami

105
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,901
to make less food than usual.

106
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:28,710
But I feel a bit… embarrassed…

107
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:31,891
to let Akagami know
that I'm trying to lose weight.

108
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,315
-Tsukuyo is so cute.
-Eh?

109
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,576
-Tsukuyo is so young girl-like.
-Eh?

110
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,174
Tsukuyo is so lewd.

111
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:40,874
Kurage?

112
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,588
How about getting married straight away?

113
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,203
Marriage!

114
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,987
What are you talking about, Kagura?

115
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:50,561
I was thinking the same thing.

116
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:55,209
I've come to see Akagami

117
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:57,321
as a very important family member.

118
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:00,991
If possible, I hope
he can stay here forever.

119
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,360
Kurage…

120
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,847
If Tsukuyo were to marry him,

121
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,756
he could stay here forever, right?

122
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,766
Do you like Akagami that much?

123
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:14,283
Akagami's cooking is too good.

124
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,077
He has control over my stomach.

125
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:20,089
I'm even willing to
give up my sister for it.

126
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,301
What are you talking about, young lady?

127
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,932
Do you compare your family to food?

128
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,566
I'm about to cry!

129
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,358
Family isn't food.

130
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,295
Hasn't any nutrition gone into your brain?

131
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,362
Since Sis Yuzuki is already engaged,

132
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,926
how about you marry Akagami?

133
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,157
Isn't that a bit too casual?

134
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:50,249
If that's the case,
why don't you marry Akagami, Kurage?

135
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,958
Just kidding.

136
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm going to seduce Akagami.

137
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,691
LET'S ESTABLISH FACTS!
Wait!

138
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,206
Upon reflection,

139
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:03,848
the dishes Akagami makes

140
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:06,343
are generally fine and low-calorie.

141
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:09,415
Is it because we are still growing?

142
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:11,463
Yes, that's right!

143
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,408
We're all still growing!

144
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,310
I see.

145
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,336
So this must be

146
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,584
a normal weight.

147
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:22,724
And the weight will definitely

148
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
bounce back quickly.

149
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,344
My apologies for the wait.

150
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:30,764
Today, I've attempted
to make Japanese sweets.

151
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,588
Take your time and enjoy.

152
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,166
Akagami, you…

153
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:40,145
A-Akagami…

154
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,338
Marriage.

155
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:43,441
Oh my…

156
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,796
MALFUNCTION
It's so delicious!

157
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,502
Today,

158
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,704
the dishes and sweets Akagami made
are as delicious as always…

159
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,053
I still hope he can stay here forever.

160
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,598
Can he wait for me

161
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,760
until I grow up?

162
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,228
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)
A DROP IN THE BUCKET

163
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:27,456
Akagami.

164
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,343
Yuzuki, what's wrong?

165
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,360
Hmm…from now on,

166
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,845
could you please add a portion
of pickled radish to each meal?

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,152
That's no problem…

168
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,264
Thank you, Akagami!

169
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:43,805
I'll leave it to you then.

170
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:47,890
But why pickled radish?

171
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:53,110
An axe? Why is she carrying an axe?

172
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,865
She's not going to execute me, right?

173
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:02,705
No way… Yuzuki wouldn't
do something like that…

174
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,493
That sound… I can't be mistaken…

175
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,583
She's practicing beheading!

176
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,695
Splitting the whole head in half?

177
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,115
Akagami…

178
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,272
I must do something to please her.

179
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,004
Wow, what a luxurious breakfast!

180
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,509
It looks delicious.

181
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,738
I'm flattered.

182
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,230
I've put my heart into this meal.
These are all Yuzuki's favorite food.

183
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,174
This should be able
to dispel her displeasure.

184
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:58,162
NO REACTION
She has no reaction?

185
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:03,269
Akagami, what's wrong?

186
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,592
No, it's not over yet.

187
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,898
This is the top-grade
pickled radish she ordered.

188
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,610
She will definitely be happy
after eating this.

189
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,731
CHEWING

190
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,472
My life… is over.

191
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:25,524
Akagami, Akagami…

192
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,222
When is the execution day?

193
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,082
Can you give me one
more chance before that?

194
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,494
Yuzuki… what's wrong this time?

195
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,310
Yuzuki…

196
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,319
I can't stand it anymore!
My legs are numb!

197
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,282
Akagami, you're just in time!

198
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,481
Help! Give me a hand…

199
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,925
What about my execution?

200
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:02,105
What do you mean?

201
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,911
Anyway, give me a hand first.

202
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,190
Who told you to stop on your own?

203
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,019
Punishment.

204
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,353
-Don't, Kiki!
-Take this!

205
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,918
Spare me.

206
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,490
I really can't… anymore…

207
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,986
Why does it feel

208
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,880
so erotic…

209
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,690
What was that just now? Practicing?

210
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,937
To be precise, it's training practice.

211
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,508
You must get used to it first.

212
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:34,571
Training?

213
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,244
That was prostration.

214
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,566
PROSTRATION

215
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,202
PLEASE ACCEPT ME AS YOUR DISCIPLE.
NO WAY!

216
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,966
It's only the first level of
the Head Temple's training,

217
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,597
but you couldn't stand it
after only two hours…

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,856
In reality, you have to keep it
for two whole days.

219
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,565
So the thing this morning was also…?

220
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,828
That was wood-chopping training.

221
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,981
You'll have to do it every day
at the training site in the future.

222
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:58,185
I thought I was really
going to be dismembered.

223
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,266
What were you thinking?

224
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,186
And today's breakfast.

225
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,298
No talking at table.

226
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,886
CHEWING
And no noises.

227
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:10,539
Even while chewing pickled radish!

228
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,186
So that was training as well.

229
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,243
In short, this child is really useless.

230
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,419
In order to become
an abbot as soon as possible,

231
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,111
you can't do without a lot of practice.

232
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,142
-Indeed.
-Indeed?

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,520
Anyway, that's how it is.

234
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,760
It might cause you a lot of trouble.

235
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:28,680
-But I still need your help.
-No problem.

236
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,291
Training, huh… it's truly
befitting of Yuzuki.

237
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,012
I too wish to tread the path
of enlightenment soon.

238
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:38,625
No! The most pressing matter
right now is to fully support Yuzuki.

239
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,430
Ah, right.

240
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,640
Why don't you try training as well?

241
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:47,849
Can I?

242
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:51,100
You seem to be eager.

243
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,657
If I don't let you train, I'm afraid
you might attack Yuzuki on the spot.

244
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:56,764
Do I look that way? I'm sorry!

245
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,666
But,

246
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,703
am I entitled to training?

247
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,623
I'm still in debt.

248
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:04,227
What are you talking about?

249
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:07,213
Your every word and action in the temple,

250
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:08,819
I've been watching them closely.

251
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,152
Be confident.

252
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:13,049
Your days here were not spent in vain.

253
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,769
With you together, I'm more confident.

254
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,077
Please be tolerant of me.

255
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,548
And you too, Yuzuki.

256
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,347
-Let's do our best together, Akagami.
-Yes, let's do it.

257
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,402
Well…

258
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,432
Miss Mia?

259
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,262
Can I join the training too?

260
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,783
Keep going!

261
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:41,826
What?

262
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:44,169
You also want to train?

263
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,591
That's really reassuring.

264
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:46,657
Really?

265
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:49,857
-Yes, we warmly welcome you!
-I'm so happy!

266
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,857
So that's it. Please be tolerant of me!

267
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,429
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

268
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:01,791
I'm back.

269
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:04,479
You've started training?

270
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,336
With Sis Yuzuki?

271
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,949
So, you're Kiki's disciples now?

272
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,187
-Exactly!
-That's right!

273
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,957
So, that means…

274
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:19,589
You all are going to be
ordained. It's not easy.

275
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,528
Ordained?

276
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,770
I forgot to explain to you.

277
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,041
Master…

278
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,601
There are many steps to becoming an abbot.

279
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,649
Before entering the training site,

280
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,647
you must be ordained first.

281
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,213
The so-called ordination,

282
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,645
READING SCRIPTURES AND SUCH
is learning the scriptures and rituals with the master,

283
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,956
FOLDING THE ROBE, WORK PROCESS
and becoming a recognized monk.

284
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,592
Simply put,

285
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,388
-it's equivalent to becoming a monk.
-I see.

286
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,664
Eh? Am I not already a monk?

287
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,564
You're just living in a temple.

288
00:16:57,075 --> 00:17:00,019
Living… in a temple… that's it?

289
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:04,339
Akagami, what's wrong?

290
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:08,431
The reason I can keep my sanity
even living under the same roof with women

291
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,975
is because I thought I had become a monk.

292
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:14,265
HAREM!

293
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,188
A pool of wine and bodies!

294
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:18,643
Now I realize all of this is false,

295
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,819
and my desires…

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,792
Calm down, Akagami!

297
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,109
That's right, you need to be calm.

298
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,782
HOLD TIGHTLY
Then you shouldn't do this to him!

299
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,382
This is also to exercise
your resistance to desires.

300
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,737
Leave that kind of thing to me!

301
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,138
Ah, no…

302
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,343
Is my path to enlightenment

303
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,765
all an illusion?

304
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,237
That's not the case.

305
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,966
The path to enlightenment

306
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:51,630
is the path of enlightenment.

307
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:53,834
This is the second insight I had

308
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,726
when I first achieved
enlightenment, Akagami.

309
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,946
Yuzuki.

310
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,416
Sis Kiki, my prostration
has reached six hours!

311
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:02,553
Is that so? Let me see.

312
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,520
Seems unexpectedly easy.

313
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:09,245
You can proceed to the next training…

314
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:12,071
Let me press here.

315
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,294
You're still far behind.

316
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,029
You guys, go chop wood next.

317
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,950
Huga!

318
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,365
Please be tolerant of my mistakes!

319
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,066
As expected of Yuzuki…

320
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,325
She's far ahead of me.

321
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,802
Do you really think so?

322
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,935
Yuzuki hasn't been ordained either.

323
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:39,175
In other words, just like you,

324
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,534
she hasn't become a monk.

325
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,542
Although she just talked big,

326
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,131
the only difference between her and you

327
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,386
should be the mind.

328
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:56,826
She could have been ordained
after studying for a year with me,

329
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,450
but Yuzuki completed
everything in just half a year.

330
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:02,010
And she hasn't missed any studies.

331
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:05,769
All of this is to become
an abbot as soon as possible.

332
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:11,147
Because she doesn't want
Mikazuki Temple to be abandoned.

333
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:14,249
I can't dawdle any longer.

334
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,146
Yuzuki!

335
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,644
Let me make my contribution!

336
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:28,283
Sounds great.

337
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:30,635
Yuzuki.

338
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,087
You said you'd fight alongside me.

339
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:38,236
Eh, I never intended to abandon you…

340
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,710
Mia will also be with us, right?

341
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,150
Let's master wood chopping
together and get ordained.

342
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,924
Chopping wood has nothing
to do with ordination.

343
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,799
Who cares?

344
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,765
Sis Kiki, Sis Yuzuki,

345
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:58,546
there's a guest.

346
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,582
Excuse us.

347
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,890
Er…

348
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:01,956
Mr. Houan?

349
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,498
He is Yuzuki's fiancé?

350
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,226
What does he want?

351
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,826
I have no idea.

352
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,026
Isn't he here to be lewd with Sis Yuzuki?

353
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:18,721
Kurage?

354
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:20,442
After all, he's her fiancé.

355
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,844
It's an adult relationship.

356
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,038
Oh dear.

357
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,618
Yuzuki wouldn't be that kind of person!

358
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,154
Right, Akagami?

359
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,488
This man

360
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,741
is going to use his status
as her fiancé to…

361
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,233
Is that really the case?

362
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:34,886
This is special training.

363
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,645
Mainly for the lower body.

364
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:39,311
What! I'm very interested!

365
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:42,854
I'm worried about Sis Yuzuki,
so I plan to hide and watch till the end.

366
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:43,803
Let's do that.

367
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,917
Why do you all seem to enjoy this?

368
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,156
Are you all Miss Yuzuki's family?

369
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,378
I apologize for the sudden visit,

370
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:53,725
but I really wanted to

371
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:56,602
see with my own eyes the temple and
family that she proudly spoke of.

372
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,928
Er… well…

373
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,262
And there's a bit of trivial matter.

374
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,086
You're Mr. Akagami, right?

375
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,552
Could I have a word with you?

376
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,022
This is really…

377
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:11,526
much more serious than I imagined.

378
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:12,987
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,945
Humph, if you're not
satisfied, just go back.

380
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,507
Sis Kiki, why did you change your clothes?

381
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,697
So, why was I called over?

382
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,051
You haven't changed a bit, Kiki.

383
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,702
Miss Aoba Yuzuki,

384
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:28,271
you haven't been ordained yet, right?

385
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:29,531
Um…

386
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,119
So what, you jerk?

387
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:32,555
Are you looking for trouble?

388
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,212
What's wrong with Sis Kiki?

389
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,614
You know what? I'm now her master.

390
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,664
With my guidance,

391
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:44,327
she can be ordained in half a year.

392
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,758
Wait, Kiki?

393
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,382
That's still too late.

394
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,279
Could you get ordained in three months?

395
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,502
What nonsense are you talking about?

396
00:21:57,334 --> 00:21:58,998
You should also know about

397
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:00,070
the difficulty of ordination
in this temple…

398
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:01,494
If you can't do it…

399
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:05,334
Please allow me to cancel the engagement.

400
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,613
What color does Sis Tsukuyo like?

401
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,191
Pink and sky blue, I guess.

402
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:52,726
She also likes red, a passionate color.

403
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,283
Quite bold.

404
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,053
By the way, what color is it today?

405
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,084
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?

406
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,750
