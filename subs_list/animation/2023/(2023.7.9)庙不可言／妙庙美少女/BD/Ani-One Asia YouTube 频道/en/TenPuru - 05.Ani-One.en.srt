00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,755
Yuzuki.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,819
I'm back.

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,311
Yuzuki, Akagami!

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,466
I'm back, Tsukuyo.

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,784
If you plan on staying out
for a night, at least let us know.

7
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:23,089
Sorry, my phone died.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,358
But it's okay. Looks like
nothing unusual happened.

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:28,990
Yes, nothing happened at all.

10
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,981
Something definitely happened!

(Episode 5: How Will You Take Responsibility?)

14
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,461
Goodbye!

15
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,502
So you missed the last bus yesterday,

16
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,136
went to a love hotel,
but nothing happened?

17
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:19,217
Yeah! We just slept there!

18
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:20,897
Really?

19
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:24,481
I thought you had an affair
on the day of your engagement.

20
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,225
Did you think it this way?

21
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:29,196
But Yuzuki,

22
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:32,119
you absolutely cannot
tell anyone at school

23
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,455
that Akagami is living with us.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,870
Eh? But isn't it common for
a temple attendant to live in the temple?

25
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,450
It is a nunnery, Yuzuki.

26
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,283
Is it necessary to be so cautious?

27
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,191
Of course! Living with a young man

28
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,325
would harm our reputation…

29
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:48,756
But if it's Akagami, it's okay, right?

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,424
-We went to a love hotel and nothing…
-Yuzuki!

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,368
Anyway!

32
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:55,056
The fact that Akagami is living
with us must be kept secret!

33
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,135
Understood?

34
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,588
Gosh, Yuzuki really
has no vigilance at all.

35
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:09,468
Before Akagami came, she was more…

36
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,692
She was more…

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,360
Tsuki.

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,771
Morning.

39
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:20,037
Mana, Yuki, good morning.

40
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,995
What's up? You look a bit down.

41
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,610
Ah, it's just something at home.

42
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,469
Something at the temple?

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,138
Right, speaking of the temple,

44
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,425
I heard you have a boyfriend?

45
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,014
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,522
I don't!

47
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,475
Somebody saw you.

48
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,947
Saw me?

49
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,261
They saw you kissing a man
by the river after the rain.

50
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:47,301
And then you went home together!

51
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,649
That must be someone else.

52
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,886
But that man was wearing a monk's robe.

53
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,355
A monk's robe?

54
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,675
Was it then?

55
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,086
No!

56
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,916
And it wasn't just the two of us!
Yuzuki was there too!

57
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,526
Oh, in front of your sister!

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,656
I told you it wasn't like that!

59
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:12,621
-We were just whispering!
-Whispering?

60
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:14,973
Yes! And the kiss…

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,240
You did kiss after all!

62
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,208
-Then he is your boyfriend.
-Tell us more about it.

63
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:22,974
No!

64
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:26,076
-This is quite an event.
-Yes, it is.

65
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:29,438
You are the target of many boys.

66
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:31,927
What?

67
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,861
Although you don't realize it,

68
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:37,701
the Aoba sisters are
quite popular in school.

69
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,727
Your sister Yuzuki is
famous for her beauty.

70
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,344
And you…

71
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,943
-You are big.
-Huge.

72
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,591
What are you saying?

73
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:49,101
The news that you have a boyfriend

74
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,405
is now all the rage.

75
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,510
Ah…

76
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,898
Tell us about it!

77
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,227
-Tell us about it.
-That's not good.

78
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:57,275
If they know that I'm living with him,

79
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:59,166
it's all over…

80
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,988
What's wrong?

81
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,515
-He came to school?
-How vigilant.

82
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,362
And he's wearing a monk's robe.

83
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,802
TSUKUYO'S LUNCH

84
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:13,329
I was so careless?

85
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:14,964
I'm going to the infirmary!

86
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:17,301
-The infirmary?
-And she's sprinting.

87
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:20,201
Excuse me, which class is Aoba Tsukuyo in?

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,880
The Aoba sisters…

89
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,661
Wait, who are you?

90
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,733
Sorry, I didn't introduce myself.

91
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,741
I'm here to deliver lunch to Tsukuyo.

92
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,266
Akagami…

93
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,022
Where am I?

94
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,341
You're awake?

95
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,961
Shh, it's me!

96
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,541
Tsukuyo? What is this…

97
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,102
The infirmary.

98
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,598
The teacher hasn't arrived at this time.

99
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:58,969
You forgot your lunch box.

100
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,350
Well… Even though I want to thank you…

101
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,611
I've completed my task. See you.

102
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:08,569
Wait! Gym class is about to begin!

103
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,253
You will be seen!

104
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,502
Is there any problem?

105
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,074
There're many problems!

106
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,402
You wearing a monk's robe
is too conspicuous!

107
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:18,109
I don't think a person wearing a monk's robe
in school would be considered suspicious.

108
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,899
This depends on
the timing and location, Akagami.

109
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,634
Anyway, you hide here for now.

110
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:27,187
No way! The teacher is here?

111
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,402
1-B KANNA, 1-B GEKKA

112
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,638
Excuse us.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,216
Tsuki, are you there?

114
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,218
Hello.

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,616
How do you feel?

116
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,486
I lied down for a while and feel fine now.

117
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,706
Not fine at all!

118
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,028
Why did you come over?

119
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,838
Next is gym class, we just
came by to check on you.

120
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,168
Really? Thanks. I'm fine now. Don't worry.

121
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,530
Hey, Tsuki.

122
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,514
Why do your legs look so long?

123
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,732
Not good! I have to shrink
into the blanket a bit more…

124
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,026
Not good! I have to move up a bit…

125
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:00,607
What's wrong?

126
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,667
Leg… leg cramp.

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,816
Oh, a cramp.

128
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,892
Yes! It's not a big deal.

129
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,991
If I don't mind this guy
getting in my clothes…

130
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,250
The break is about to end.

131
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,170
You should go to class.

132
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,649
Yeah, we should go.

133
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:20,312
Hey, Tsuki, did you get fat?

134
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,892
It must be your imagination.

135
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,643
I didn't get fat at all!

136
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,891
She's gonna cry!

137
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,677
-Please go, please.
-Sorry.

138
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,073
I'm suffocating.

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,704
If I don't breathe…

140
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,095
What…

141
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,223
What did he do?

142
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,152
Tsuki, listen to me.

143
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,068
You're still not going back
to the archery club?

144
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,761
The competition is coming soon.

145
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,937
Everyone misses you.

146
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,038
Sorry, I'm really busy at home.

147
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:02,209
Ah, you still can't?

148
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:05,777
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay. We don't want to force you.

149
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:08,067
Well, we'll go now.

150
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,145
It's… it's like nirvana…

151
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,963
This guy took advantage of me.

152
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,324
Tsukuyo, you used to
be in the archery club?

153
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,926
Well… 'used to' is not accurate.

154
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,256
You're not planning to continue?

155
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,148
Right now, I'm… taking a break…

156
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,198
I see. Then let's go through
the procedures to resume it.

157
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,146
Eh…wait…

158
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:38,991
It's okay. Leave the work at home to me!

159
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:40,625
Wait a minute, Akagami!

160
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:47,001
1-B KANNA, 1-B GEKKA
Tsuki, the class after gym is changed into self-study.

161
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,367
THE NARROW DOOR IS HARD TO ENTER
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

162
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,164
I used to admire her posture in archery,

163
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:06,644
and that dignified face.

164
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:10,643
CLUB ENTRY APPLICATION FROM 1-B AOBA TSUKUYO
I want to get closer to her, even just a little bit.

165
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:12,225
But…

166
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,661
Eh, you are going to
quit the archery club?

167
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,052
Why?

168
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,508
I plan to… inherit this temple.

169
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,438
Why is that…

170
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:31,961
Why do I still have this dream?

171
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,789
You worked hard, Akagami.

172
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:38,428
Good morning.

173
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,107
Eh, is that a bow?

174
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:44,155
Yes, archery is also called standing Zen.

175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,736
STANDING ZEN
I heard that Buddhist colleges offer related courses.

176
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:52,025
-Would you like to try, Akagami?
-I would love to!

177
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,480
Tsukuyo is in the archery club, right?

178
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,040
Yes, but she quit.

179
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:15,460
That's a pity.

180
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:16,785
Quit?

181
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,531
I remember Tsukuyo said…

182
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,371
Tsukuyo?

183
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:26,919
She won't open the door.

184
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:28,903
She's in hermit mode right now.

185
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,587
Whenever Tsukuyo has
something bothering her,

186
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:32,873
she'll lock herself in her room.

187
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,895
No problem! Leave it to me!

188
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,318
There's no point in
worrying about this now.

189
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,148
Right now I'm… taking a break…

190
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,066
I really have a knack
for giving up halfway.

191
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,450
Tsukuyo!

192
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,452
Tsukuyo!

193
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,570
Can I take a bit of your time?

194
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,754
I have a few words to say to you.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,088
I'm saved.

196
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,173
What do you want to do?

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,303
What did you want to say? Say it.

198
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,021
I've already done today's
cooking, washing, and cleaning.

199
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,158
I've also checked last month's accounts.

200
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:29,259
I can handle hosting and
answering the phone by myself.

201
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:31,939
Thank you.

202
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,577
So, Tsukuyo!

203
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,663
You can return to the archery
club without any worries.

204
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,949
-You should do it today…
-Listen, Akagami.

205
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,763
You seem to have misunderstood
something since yesterday.

206
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,024
I don't really want to practice archery.

207
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,649
Is that so?

208
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:53,501
Hmm.

209
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:55,474
Then why are you still on hiatus

210
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:58,043
instead of just quitting?

211
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,618
It seems like you're preparing
to return at any time.

212
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,504
I feel a bit breathless.
I'll go out for a walk.

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,432
I'll leave the rest
of the work to you, Akagami.

214
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,842
Akagami…

215
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,032
He's always meddling
in other people's business.

216
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:21,542
What should I do after this?

217
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,226
-Over here.
-Wait for me.

218
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,519
Oh my, how did I end up here?

219
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:46,741
Oh gosh, they are organizing
this place so carelessly.

220
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:50,793
This bowstring is tied so badly.

221
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:07,985
Draw.

222
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:10,673
Release.

223
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,605
What am I doing?

224
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,434
Bullseye!

225
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,976
Akagami? Why are you here?

226
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:22,985
Damn!

227
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,402
Tsukuyo?

228
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,058
Why are you running away?

229
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,538
Nothing.

230
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,738
I just don't want others
to see me with you.

231
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,746
Have you made up your mind
to return to the archery club?

232
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,656
I said that I don't want to continue.

233
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:52,640
But,

234
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:54,880
Tsukuyo, you look very happy

235
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,800
on the archery field.

236
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,648
Exactly.

237
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,977
I can't… because it just makes me happy…

238
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:13,366
I'm not particularly talented in archery.

239
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:14,577
The reason I started practicing archery

240
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:17,850
was because Yuzuki was in the archery
club and I just followed her.

241
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,903
The person who should
continue practicing archery

242
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,655
shouldn't be me, but Yuzuki.

243
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,303
She's more talented than me,

244
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:31,738
and more reputable.

245
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,487
But she quit.

246
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,052
Yuzuki is forcing herself
for the sake of everyone else.

247
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,124
How can I be so selfish
and do whatever I want?

248
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,055
You should understand

249
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,167
the difficulties of
inheriting this temple!

250
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,471
Sis Yuzuki is just a high school student.

251
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,332
But she's determined to inherit
the temple and go on dates.

252
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,225
I can't do it like her.

253
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,001
Yuzuki is really amazing.

254
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,294
In summary,

255
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:09,814
you think Yuzuki quit the archery club
and she's forcing herself for something,

256
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,282
so you can't just think about
your own happiness, right?

257
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,468
-I've said it several times…
-Come with me.

258
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:16,968
I have something to show you.

259
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:18,597
What?

260
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,368
Right here.

261
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,432
Isn't this our temple?

262
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,968
-Yes, right behind the main hall!
-Eh, wait…

263
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,044
How is she…

264
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,668
I want you to understand

265
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,785
whether Yuzuki is really
just struggling in pain

266
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,026
like you said.

267
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,994
Please accept

268
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:01,980
the real Yuzuki.

269
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,348
No… I don't want to see…

270
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,396
Her face

271
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,919
is still the one I used to admire.

272
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:30,665
That's the real Yuzuki.

273
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:35,045
The so-called talent

274
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,697
is just the memories you fabricated.

275
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:40,375
That's super cool!

276
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,330
I said I didn't want to see it!

277
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,122
Akagami, you're an idiot!

278
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:49,720
After seeing it, I will want to
return to the archery club!

279
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:51,481
Calm down, Tsukuyo.

280
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,994
Did you look closely?

281
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,410
What you just saw was
an abled sports idiot.

282
00:16:57,575 --> 00:17:01,479
She practiced archery for over a year,
but still can't master it at all.

283
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:03,895
I'm right here, Akagami.

284
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,593
I told you I don't have
any talent for archery.

285
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,564
That's why I quit.

286
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,083
Can't be more obvious.

287
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:14,117
It's okay! Miss Yuzuki!

288
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:15,959
Your posture is very beautiful,

289
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,546
although there's nothing
else good about it.

290
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,569
Mia, stop talking.

291
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:25,393
Let me try again!
The last time was just a warm-up!

292
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,358
Ah? Yuzuki's archery skills are very bad.

293
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,285
And she didn't quit the club
because of family reasons.

294
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:37,523
Really?

295
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,416
You didn't know?

296
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:43,360
Uh, well…

297
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:47,311
Tsukuyo is blinded by
her excessive love for her big sister.

298
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:48,961
Kurage!

299
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,128
What do you mean?

300
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,023
Tsukuyo loves you too much.

301
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,476
She enters that state
as long as she sees you with a bow.

302
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,057
Eh, it makes me shy. Stop it.

303
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:03,019
Stop talking.

304
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,067
Anyway! Sis Yuzuki!

305
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,514
Are you happy now?

306
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,574
Yes! I'm happy every day.

307
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,518
The work at the temple is indeed not easy,

308
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:17,246
but every day is very fulfilling.

309
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:20,766
I'm thinking if this is
what I really want to do.

310
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,994
So, you should do what
you want to do too, Tsukuyo.

311
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,342
Don't worry about things at home.

312
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:28,984
There's one more thing.

313
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,100
Could you occasionally

314
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,599
teach me archery?

315
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,540
-Ahahaha!
-What are you laughing at?

316
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:43,845
Although I think I'm stupid,

317
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:46,457
I remember a good thing.

318
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:50,328
Back then, Yuzuki said it with a smile.

319
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,346
I plan to… inherit this temple.

320
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,384
Ah, I've sweated a lot.

321
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,240
I'll go take a shower first.

322
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,759
Sorry, I saw it again…

323
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,922
I'm also very sorry…

324
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,594
We are always so reckless.

325
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,614
I have also done
a lot of rude things to you.

326
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:24,498
It's okay.

327
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,498
-Hey… Akagami.
-Hmm?

328
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,641
I decided to return to the archery club.

329
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,014
How should I put it…
It's all thanks to you.

330
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,263
Thank you.

331
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,065
Really? That's great.

332
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,181
Akagami,

333
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:45,125
why did you do this for me?

334
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:49,235
I just feel that it's not good.

335
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:54,163
Not being able to do things you want
because of family reasons.

336
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,787
I also gave up a lot

337
00:19:57,171 --> 00:20:00,115
because of the name Akagami.

338
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:05,367
Is that why you came to this temple?

339
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:07,991
How should I put it?

340
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,359
I just want

341
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,341
to make you feel happy.

342
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:20,863
I haven't changed my clothes yet.

343
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:23,314
Look, this hasn't gone down yet.

344
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,622
The hickey you gave me
in the school infirmary.

345
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,708
How will you take
responsibility this time?

346
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,923
What should I do…

347
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:35,639
How about doubling your debt?

348
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:36,891
Please have mercy!

349
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:39,105
-Alright, stand still.
-Yes.

350
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,271
Close your eyes.

351
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:58,734
Idiot.

352
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:01,742
I drew something on
your forehead. Let's call it even.

353
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,814
Get dressed quickly.

354
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:07,079
LEWDMITSU

355
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,239
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,514
Ah! Tsukuyo forgot to bring lunch again.

357
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,050
I have to send it to her.

358
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:31,169
Akagami, buy some milk on the way back.

359
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,463
Understood.

360
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:35,727
This is new.

361
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,870
Tsukuyo.

362
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:40,983
You forgot your lunch.

363
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:42,903
Thank you.

364
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:46,793
-What's this?
-The love lunch from your boyfriend?

365
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:48,841
I said I don't have a boyfriend.

366
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:50,761
He's just…

367
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,114
my family.

368
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,116
-What do you mean?
-Siblings?

369
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,542
Alright, go back quickly.

370
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,460
Ah, okay.

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,616
Let's… Let's establish facts.

372
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:48,946
Indirect kiss?

373
00:23:48,957 --> 00:23:51,645
Only elementary school
students care about that.

374
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,460
Let's… Let's establish facts.

375
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,604
Have you experienced it?

376
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:58,164
If you don't understand, just shut up.

377
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,914
