1
00:00:00,525 --> 00:00:06,989
Avalokita, the Holy Lord and Bodhisattva,
was moving in the deep course of the Wisdom which has gone beyond.

2
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,593
He looked down from on high.
He beheld but five heaps…

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:12,209
Mikazuki Temple will easily overcome

4
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:16,203
the difficulties if you leave.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,178
Whatever is form, that is emptiness;
whatever is emptiness, that is form.

6
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,405
WORLDLY DESIRES

7
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:39,175
TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-

8
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,623
(Episode 9: It's Very Erotic to Make Rice Cake)

9
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,639
Hey.

10
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,352
So, at the end of the year,
the temple makes rice cakes?

11
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,068
We will make extra, then distribute them
to the parishioners.

12
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,283
I'm going to open it now.

13
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,796
Let's divide into two groups
and start making,

14
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:14,291
Okay.

15
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:17,379
It's me, Tsukuyo, and Kurage in a group.

16
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,324
Let's do it.

17
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,250
This is also a form of practice.

18
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,722
I have to be on my toes.

19
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,261
Akagami,

20
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,796
it's very erotic to make rice cake.

21
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:33,272
What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

22
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,181
Isn't this
a traditional cultural activity?

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,896
You see, what's the implication
of making rice cakes?

24
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,970
It's to pray for
many children and grandchildren, right?

25
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,789
You think that's erotic?

26
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,389
You really are innocent.

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,848
The mallet represents the male.

28
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,012
The stone mortar represents the female.

29
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:51,105
COMBINE
And then you use these two things to hammer and beat.

30
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,417
-Miss Kurage, stop talking.
-We can't work.

31
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,473
Shall we switch our tasks?

32
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,734
This is somewhat perverse at some level.

33
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,478
What do you want us to do?

34
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,243
Steady your mind, Akagami Akemitsu.

35
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,213
I need to focus on
the rice cake in front of me.

36
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,758
I'm going to start pounding now.

37
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,025
-One, two.
-Swaying.

38
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,058
Swaying.

39
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:19,991
Swaying.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
You need to knead it too, Akagami.

41
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:29,161
Sorry, I couldn't figure out
what to knead.

42
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:31,947
Let's switch back then.

43
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,571
I actually confused
rice cakes with breasts.

44
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:36,936
What a failure!

45
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,560
This time I must steady my mind.

46
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,302
Akagami,

47
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,421
there are three big rice cakes here.

48
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,859
What? Three?

49
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:49,853
RICE CAKE ONE, RICE CAKE TWO,
RICE CAKE THREE

50
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,922
Desires, dismiss!

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,408
You actually poked your own eyes?

52
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,856
Leave this to me, Akagami.
You go wash your eyes.

53
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,049
Understood.

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,004
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

55
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,791
Miss Kurage, why did you make that joke?

56
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,916
-You mean about the breasts?
-Yes, the one about breasts.

57
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,579
I think you'll be happy, Akagami.

58
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,725
Is that the kind of person I am to you?

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,912
Would you be happy if it were Sis Yuzuki?

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,010
No, no.

61
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,392
Or would you be happier if it were me?

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,857
-Hahaha.
-What are you laughing at?

63
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:30,308
Alright, I'm going to help Mia
and Miss Kagura next.

64
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:34,801
I really wish I could grow up faster.

65
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,490
Huh? Where are Mia and Miss Kagura?

66
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:40,291
Sorry to keep you waiting.

67
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:42,793
I went to change into
the rice cake costume.

68
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:45,765
When it comes to making rice cake,
we can't forget about the moon rabbit.

69
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:49,805
A long time ago, the moon rabbit offered 
its own body to the starving Buddha.

70
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:51,547
And then it ascended to the moon.

71
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,466
So making rice cakes

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,715
is a way of allowing the noble soul
of the moon rabbit to dwell in oneself,

73
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:58,147
and thus experiencing
the difficulty of obtaining food.

74
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:01,053
This is the costume for this ritual!

75
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,474
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES, BUNNY GIRL
This is recorded in the Bunny Girl Making Rice Cakes section.

76
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,289
Is this a real story?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,496
But dressing like this
for ascetic practice is a bit…

78
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,770
Don't keep staring at me.

79
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:13,953
I still get shy.

80
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,780
Miss Mia, you'll catch a cold
in that outfit.

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,952
We have a heater here.

82
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,914
It's so warm.

83
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,778
Let's start then.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,304
I couldn't stop them!

85
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,364
Why are we sharing a coat?

86
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,918
It's a precaution
against wardrobe malfunction and the cold.

87
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:38,847
I'm warm.

88
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,834
Indeed, it's warm, but…

89
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,398
To prevent Mia's wardrobe malfunction,
tightly hold her breasts with the clothes.

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,152
What kind of wearing a coat is this!

91
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,977
COMPLETE ASCETIC PRACTICES
The Duo's Kimono-style Coat is when a man and a woman share a coat.

92
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,881
It's hard to hold back,
but let's do it together, Akagami.

93
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,075
Since it has come to this.

94
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,486
Akagami?

95
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,800
What I'm holding
is neither a breast nor a mallet.

96
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,078
I'm lifting Miss Mia herself and pounding!

97
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,669
Lift and pound!

98
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,814
Lift and pound!

99
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,583
Lift and pound!

100
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,044
Good, it works.

101
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,468
Lift and pound!

102
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:23,222
This method works, Miss Mia.

103
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,751
Akagami has his strong arms

104
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,715
wrapped around me
from behind in a lewd manner.

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,912
Not good, let's take a break.

106
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,998
Then it's my turn, right?

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,280
Miss Tsukuyo.

108
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,631
It's a bunny girl!

109
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,712
You're the one who said you'd tell
everyone we kissed if I didn't wear this.

110
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:43,952
You suck.

111
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,412
Did I say that?

112
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,588
I didn't say that. You know I didn't.

113
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,019
Hey, Akagami.

114
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:53,007
Why am I the only one
dressed in a doll costume?

115
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:57,663
Why? Why? Why? Why?

116
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,828
This situation is not good.

117
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,610
I'm surrounded by rabbits,
which represent lust.

118
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,531
Distracting thoughts are attacking me.

119
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,115
What are you doing, Akagami?

120
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,646
Miss Yuzuki?

121
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,484
I just went out for a little while.

122
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,575
Miss Yuzuki, I'm not…

123
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,367
Um…

124
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:19,493
You made Mia, Tsukuyo,
and the others dress like this.

125
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,196
What exactly are you planning to do?

126
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,707
Miss Yuzuki, my shoulder is about to…

127
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,802
Are you practicing asceticism?
Dressed like bunny girls?

128
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,024
I've never heard of such asceticism.

129
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,906
So Complete Ascetic Practices
is a forgery?

130
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,566
She really wants to kick me out.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,344
Sorry to keep you waiting.

132
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,631
It's vegetable hot pot.

133
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,583
It's getting colder recently,

134
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,759
so I thought I'd
make something to warm the body.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,752
-It's delicious.
-So warm.

136
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,668
Huh? Where's Kiki?

137
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:03,308
She might be in her room.

138
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,458
Is that so? Then I'll take it to her.

139
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:08,361
Thanks, Akagami.

140
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,346
Did you know?

141
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,153
The so-called vegetable hot pot

142
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,845
was invented by
a laundry worker named Ten.

143
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:22,135
Kiki.

144
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:24,631
It's you.

145
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:27,237
What are you doing outside
in such cold weather?

146
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:28,819
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

147
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,343
Here is your dinner.

148
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,519
Oh, thank you so much.

149
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,091
Akagami, would you like to have some?

150
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,679
Uh… okay.

151
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:43,663
Akagami, you're really good at cooking.

152
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,270
But you don't have
to drink in the hallway.

153
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,178
I love the view from here.

154
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,246
View?

155
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,014
You're drinking quite happily, aren't you?

156
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,766
I haven't had a drink
since the last mixer.

157
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,990
The ordaining ceremony
for Yuzuki is not far away.

158
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:09,166
We are all very grateful to you, Akagami.

159
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:13,479
You flatter me. I haven't figured out
the renovation fee for the Buddha yet.

160
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,135
That's true.

161
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,951
But if we overcome this crisis,

162
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:23,111
Yuzuki's dream of inheriting the Mikazuki
Temple will be one step closer to reality.

163
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:28,163
After that, we should explore
the real face of this temple.

164
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,281
The real face?

165
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,564
Inheriting the temple is not the end,

166
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,316
it's a new beginning.

167
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:41,332
What are your plans
following Yuzuki's ordain?

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,204
Uh…

169
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,779
Do you want to continue
to be a temple attendant?

170
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:47,607
Or do you want to keep practicing
after you've been ordained

171
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,143
and eventually become the abbot?

172
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,751
Yuzuki will one day become
the abbot of this temple.

173
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:55,488
When that day comes,
I will also leave the temple.

174
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,206
If you can be by her side at that time,

175
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,730
Yuzuki will surely feel more secure.

176
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:08,071
I thought about taking you with me 
when I inherit my family fortune.

177
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:10,119
After all, you are an exceptional talent.

178
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,231
Running the temple with you

179
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:15,367
sounds like a promising career path.

180
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:18,044
So do you want to work for me?

181
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:20,707
I'll make it worth your while.

182
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,064
Working for me for the rest
of your life is a good job.

183
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,631
How about it? Hmm?

184
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,506
You're drunk, Kiki.

185
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,342
I should go take a bath now, excuse me.

186
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:44,363
A VIRGIN BEFORE, A HARE AFTER

187
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,889
CHI SHRINE

188
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,006
BABY CAKE

189
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,067
TAKOYAKI

190
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,180
So.

191
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:56,474
Wish you.

192
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:57,693
A happy.

193
00:10:57,977 --> 00:10:59,663
New Year.

194
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,895
Keep your voices down, everyone.

195
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,574
Sorry, did we disturb you?

196
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,604
Put this on.

197
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:12,899
DRAW DIVINATION STICKS
What is this?

198
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:14,421
It's a disguise.

199
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:16,965
TEMPLE VS SHRINE
After all, we're on enemy territory.

200
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:18,821
A HISTORY OF BLOODY BATTLES
Your idea is too bloody.

201
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,076
A number of conflicts have arisen
in the past between temples and shrines,

202
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,206
but things are back
to normal between them now.

203
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,398
There was even a time when Buddhas

204
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,790
and Shinto were combined,
known as the Shinbutsu-Ko.

205
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,665
Akagami, you're overthinking it.

206
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:42,076
What's the matter?

207
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,292
Don't you have any thoughts about

208
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:45,867
seeing me in a kimono?

209
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,431
That's really rude.

210
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,735
I don't really care.

211
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,346
But if you see other girls, you have
to sincerely praise them for being cute.

212
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,526
You are very cute, Miss Tsukuyo.

213
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:57,747
So cute that it's extraordinary,
so cute that it's astonishing!

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,264
You're too cute, too cute that the word
'cute' doesn't even do you justice.

215
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:02,992
Enough!

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,152
Why is she angry?

217
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,540
Miss Kurage, are you writing an ema?

218
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:15,319
You look especially cute today.

219
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,340
WARDING OFF BAD LUCK
No, Akagami.

220
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:21,785
When praising mature women,
you should use the word 'beautiful'.

221
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,305
PRAYER RECEPTION
I see.

222
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,570
Children can get snacks here.

223
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,760
Snacks?

224
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,257
Miss Kurage, you are beautiful.

225
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,905
Thank you.

226
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,906
Akagami, I have no idea how
to draw divination sticks.

227
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,022
DIVINATION STICKS
This is how you do it.

228
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,891
Turn it over and look at
the number on the stick that falls out.

229
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,838
You're a big help.

230
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:51,782
Miss Mia, you're really beautiful.

231
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,942
Yes, this kimono is indeed very beautiful.

232
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,234
I didn't mean that.

233
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:01,171
Are you praising me?

234
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:05,827
Yes, but accurately
complimenting a lady can be difficult.

235
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,305
That's simply.

236
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,908
Just say what you find attractive

237
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:10,672
about the other person.

238
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,697
Could you give me an example?

239
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,380
Let me think.

240
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:16,828
AMULET COLLECTION POINT

241
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,119
Akagami.

242
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:27,756
Are you okay?

243
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,068
You're beautiful.

244
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,910
Thank you.

245
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,538
No! What Miss Mia taught me just now was…

246
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,859
M-May I embrace you, Miss Yuzuki?

247
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,795
You just wasted your compliment, Akagami.

248
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,092
Everyone seems to be very happy.

249
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,513
After all, it's been a long time
since we came for a New Year visit.

250
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:50,071
Is that so?

251
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:51,221
Every year,

252
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,677
we drag out end-of-year tasks
until the New Year.

253
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,383
But from now on,
we can come every year, can't we?

254
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:00,898
With everyone.

255
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,085
That's right.

256
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,366
AMULET COLLECTION POINT

257
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,822
If I leave,

258
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:10,396
the temple's financial issues
could be resolved.

259
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:12,612
I'll protect you.

260
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:13,365
Huh?

261
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,766
I will protect Mikazuki Temple.

262
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:18,670
I will protect everyone's home.

263
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,716
Miss Yuzuki.

264
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:24,495
When I was going for matchmaking, it was
because I stuck with it until the end,

265
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:26,367
and that's how we achieved our goal.

266
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,576
I remember. That's when I swore.

267
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,392
I will support her.

268
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,813
Akagami, where are you going?

269
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,472
It's my job to help Mia

270
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,944
become the queen of eroticism.

271
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,689
I think it's a simple but boring task.

272
00:14:57,525 --> 00:15:00,405
Are you Mia Christoph?

273
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,042
Nice to meet you, I'm Kagura Baldwin.

274
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,691
Let's be friends, Mia.

275
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,675
Mia was later revealed
to be a defiant child.

276
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:18,834
This is an erotic strike, Kagura!

277
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,807
This is an erotic runaway plan, Kagura!

278
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,064
This is promoting the refusal
of erotic creation, Kagura!

279
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,622
I've thought about the lyrics.

280
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,703
She's really a strange child.

281
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:35,597
Why does she have to
go against her family's orders?

282
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,458
Wouldn't it be better to be obedient?

283
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,354
Going with the flow is so much easier.

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,472
Mia is going to Japan?

285
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,449
Yes.

286
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,454
What is she thinking?

287
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,118
In order to guide her
to become the queen of eroticism,

288
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,742
I tried all kinds of temptations.

289
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,966
But Mia suppressed her desires
with a strong rationality.

290
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,702
It seems that's the case.

291
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,838
Why not let her live
an extreme ascetic life?

292
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:07,472
Use the plain days of a nunnery
to ignite her inner thirst.

293
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,562
Make her want to approach men on her own.

294
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,212
So that's what you mean
by playing hard to get.

295
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,147
I approved.

296
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,838
However,

297
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,089
during your time in Japan,

298
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,517
you must let Mia have
sex intercourse with 100 males.

299
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:27,223
And record it in the video camera.

300
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,514
Send me it every three days.

301
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:32,804
If I don't receive it,

302
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,489
then you will be forcibly repatriated.

303
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:36,869
I understand.

304
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,564
May I ask one more question?

305
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,880
You're not falling for that kid, are you?

306
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:52,272
Of course not.

307
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:55,785
Nevertheless,

308
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:00,981
sending it once
every three days is impractical.

309
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,332
I had to use this method
to muddle through for now.

310
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,773
Then that man appeared.

311
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,333
I instigated Mia to get together with him.

312
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,853
And I was able to obtain a large amount
of material for photo editing.

313
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,014
Smooth.

314
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:21,110
The stubborn Mia also
gradually became cheerful.

315
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,446
But…

316
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:28,390
She's not really falling
for Akagami, is she?

317
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:32,509
Mia was not allowed
to have genuine feelings for him,

318
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,981
regardless of whether
she was interested or lustful in him.

319
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,524
Do you have an answer, Akagami?

320
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:46,761
After careful consideration,
I think I should leave indeed.

321
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,350
Both Mikazuki Temple
and I have financial problems.

322
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,389
That's right, that's right.

323
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:56,970
Not only is my debt completely cleared,
but the main Buddha can also be repaired.

324
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:00,189
Such good conditions
may not come a second time.

325
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,047
That's right.

326
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:04,452
The person Mia longs
for day and night will disappear.

327
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:06,499
That's good.

328
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,968
Once you leave,
the remittance can be sent immediately.

329
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,876
What's wrong with you?

330
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,766
Thank you very much
for your kindness, Miss Kagura.

331
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,224
But please allow me to refuse!

332
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,940
Huh? You actually turned down
such favorable terms as I offered?

333
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,390
Including your father's debt,

334
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,233
the fee for Tsukuyo's kiss, and the repair
costs for the motorcycle and truck.

335
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,333
You know too much, don't you?

336
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:36,903
More importantly,
the main Buddha's urgent repair costs.

337
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,137
What are you going to do
about the dilemma at hand?

338
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,096
Do you have any way
to change the situation?

339
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,177
It's okay. Things will work out.

340
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,605
What gives you the nerve to say that?

341
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:50,215
I feel it's okay, so it's okay.

342
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:53,335
You are just avoiding reality.

343
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,836
Isn't there a limit
to having a simple mind?

344
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,059
Please stop saying
bad things about Miss Yuzuki.

345
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,654
I'm talking about you.

346
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,599
If I leave the temple, it may temporarily
alleviate the financial strain.

347
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:08,787
This is a temporary fix
that won't fix the problem.

348
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:12,657
You mean they will eventually
face the same dilemma?

349
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:13,607
Yes.

350
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:16,059
And I've sworn.

351
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:18,747
No matter what happens,
I will support Miss Yuzuki.

352
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:21,609
There must be something I can do.

353
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,488
So I don't want to run away alone.

354
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,692
I can't persuade him anymore, can I?

355
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,108
Is that so?
Then I will withdraw my request.

356
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,924
Well, making money is not that easy.

357
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,928
Anyway, he'll come
to me crying for help after a while.

358
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,687
That's great.
Now I can keep my promise to Miss Mia.

359
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,351
We swore to fight together.

360
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,817
I can't betray her.

361
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,482
Promise? Can't betray her?

362
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,854
You have the audacity to say this.

363
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,986
You are clearly obsessed with Aoba Yuzuki.

364
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,076
Although Mia didn't notice it herself,
she really likes you.

365
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:03,745
What will she do when she realizes
this is an unattainable love?

366
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,578
Perhaps she will be so devastated
that she can't love anyone else.

367
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,424
Miss Kagura?

368
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:13,233
People like you.

369
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:15,192
Have no right to mention Mia's name.

370
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:16,811
You unfaithful man.

371
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:18,978
Miss Kagura, you're actually angry.

372
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,913
This is the first time I've seen
Miss Kagura being so emotional.

373
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,845
I'm not angry at all!

374
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,087
No, you see, you're shouting so loudly.

375
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:29,380
My voice is not loud at all.

376
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,758
Why are you laughing?

377
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:32,991
With this, I can rest assured,

378
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:36,063
seeing you get so angry for Miss Mia.

379
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,983
I told you I'm not angry.

380
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,212
Miss Kagura, you value Miss Mia

381
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,505
more than family matters and the like.

382
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:46,128
I've always found it strange.

383
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,427
How could you possibly betray Miss Mia?

384
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,538
What are you saying?

385
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,318
After all,

386
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:56,834
the smiles you show to each other
seem genuine.

387
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,411
This is not a betrayal,

388
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,803
it's an act of your true heart
for Miss Mia.

389
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:07,720
-No, no.
-So, Miss Kagura, you will…

390
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,371
I kicked something.

391
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,076
I'm just being true to my job.

392
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,028
Even if I have to stake the Baldwin
family name, I will make the plan work.

393
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:28,363
Really. You are totally wrong.

394
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,808
CHI SHRINE

395
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,074
Kagura.

396
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,174
Sorry for the wait, everyone.

397
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,708
Have you seen Akagami?

398
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,578
He's already asleep.

399
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,440
Kagura, you came just in time.

400
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,502
We're debating

401
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:51,766
whether there's any way
to quickly make a lot of money.

402
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,810
Everyone has given me
a lot of suggestions.

403
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,620
Leave this to us.
Kagura is very reliable.

404
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:03,473
After all, we're best friends
with one heart.

405
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,689
Right, Kagura?

406
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,702
Oh my, oh my.

407
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:12,468
After all, this is just my job.

408
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,482
(Next Episode)
Burning with desire.

409
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:49,402
(It's Just That I'm a Little Horny)
That's called a blazing flame.

410
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:51,467
You see a flame burning
in Akagami's chest.

411
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,178
It's not like my heart skips a beat
when I see him.

412
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:56,072
It's just that I'm a little horny.

413
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,424
Then allow me to sing a song now.
