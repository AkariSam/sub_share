1
00:00:00,903 --> 00:00:03,147
-By the way, Yuzuki.
-Hmm?

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,378
You look very relaxed.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,810
But the blind date you postponed
due to various reasons,

4
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:09,502
isn't it today?

5
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:12,431
The survival of this temple

6
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,632
relies on your blind date, doesn't it?

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,356
MIKAZUKI TEMPLE
I'm going to be late.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,858
Where is the blind date?

9
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:20,394
Ryūkoku Temple

10
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:21,885
In fact,

11
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,050
we should have

12
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,661
moved out of this temple immediately.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,132
My parents aren't here and
the temple has no abbot.

14
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,998
Without an abbot, his family

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,255
does not have the right
to stay in the temple.

16
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,563
But if my blind date is successful,

17
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,867
it would be different if we
could invite a new abbot.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,676
Miss Yuzuki, are you going to
marry someone you don't like

19
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,980
for the sake of this temple?

20
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,570
This is my own decision!

21
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:51,030
I cannot let this temple be destroyed!

22
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:52,802
NO PARKING

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,122
BUS

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,102
I still can't do it.

25
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,528
I can't inherit this temple.

26
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,081
Miss Yuzuki.

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,556
Isn't this a good time to change clothes?

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,616
Change your clothes here,

29
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:22,806
and let's go out when it
stops at the next traffic light.

30
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,346
But…

31
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,751
After we go out, we'll borrow this truck.

32
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,114
Of course, I have driving experience too.

33
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:35,128
Okay! Then let's quickly
change up and break out!

34
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,313
Understood.

35
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,564
WORLDLY DESIRES

36
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:46,296

EPISODE 4

38
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:12,140
After a lot of effort, they finally
got out of the cargo box of this truck.

39
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,700
Akemitsu and Yuzuki borrowed the truck

40
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,004
and rushed to Ryūkoku Temple.

41

TRANSPORT COMPANY, BLACK SEABASS

42
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,838
(Episode 4: Go Take a Shower First)

43
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:28,353
Kiki, I don't want this temple
to close down like this.

44
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,376
But it will take you three
years to become an abbot.

45
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,297
-This temple will be gone in a year…
-I know.

46
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,377
I decided to go on a blind date.

47
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,073
RYŪKOKU TEMPLE

48
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,714
We made it!

49
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,388
Excuse me, I am here
for today's blind date…

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,523
Are you Miss Aoba Yuzuki?

51
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:08,616
-Akagami!
-Yes, here!

52
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,845
Thank you for taking me here.

53
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,014
-I'll take it from here!
-Okay!

54
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,567
There is no man in this world

55
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,053
who would not be
fascinated by Miss Yuzuki!

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,100
TRANSPORT COMPANY, BLACK SEABASS
Eh, is she laughing at me?

57
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,829
I'll go in now!

58
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,427
Good luck!

59
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,120
In this case,

60
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,290
I will have to say goodbye to Miss Yuzuki.

61
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:36,722
If she gets married,

62
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,100
as a man, I cannot possibly
continue to live with her.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,744
Miss Yuzuki, I wish you all the happiness.

64
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:50,003
Who are you?

65
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:53,967
What are you doing here?

66
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,178
What do you mean?

67
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,197
Since you're wearing a work uniform,
you must be a temple staff.

68
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:01,865
Come and clean the yard quickly.

69
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,393
Huh? I… I'm not…

70
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,649
I'm Aoba Yuzuki.

71
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,086
Thank you very much for your hospitality.

72
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:20,867
And thank you for coming a long way.

73
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,641
RYUKOKU TEMPLE, THIRD SON, KIJOU HOUAN

74
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,378
My name is Kijou Houan.

75
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,130
Nice to meet you.

76
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,563
You are very young.

77
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,443
Why would such a young girl
come for a blind date?

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
Because I really like Mikazuki Temple

79
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,105
and everyone living there.

80
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:38,641
I see.

81
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,942
Please do come and see.

82
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,822
They are my proud family and friends.

83
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,690
They are gentle and warm,

84
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,535
and incredibly reliable.

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,773
They must be cheering for
me now, from far away.

86
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,857
Here's one right here!

87
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,009
Is it really him? Or just a look-alike?

88
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:05,329
I don't want to see

89
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,113
Miss Yuzuki with another
man on a blind date.

90
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,170
But to see that stunning beauty again…

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
But!

92
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,561
Akagami,

93
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,844
look.

94
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:26,082
Begone, worldly desires!

95
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,404
It's definitely him!

96
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:29,464
What's wrong?

97
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,684
Are you still a bit nervous?

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,152
No, I'm not.

99
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,538
It's okay.

100
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:39,255
Just imagine your friends and family
are nearby, watching over you.

101
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm at a loss right now
because he's right next to me.

102
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,703
What should I do? What was I going to say?

103
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,206
Miss Yuzuki seems a bit flustered.

104
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,344
Oh no, I'm going to distract her!

105
00:06:52,756 --> 00:06:54,292
I need to hide quickly.

106
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,278
Over here, over here!

107
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,384
That nun from before?

108
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,353
HEAVENLY MATCH

109
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,324
Since the matchmaker
fell ill and couldn't come,

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,488
I, Akagami, will take their place for now.

111
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,288
What's happening?

112
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,912
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

113
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,319
Since it's come to this,

114
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,303
at least I must become their Cupid!

115
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,662
-So, madam.
-Madam?

116
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,634
Shall we begin?

117
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,938
Ah, yes.

118
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,570
-Sir.
-Sir…

119
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:36,355
What kind of date would you like
to have with the woman you like?

120
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,603
I'd like to go see a movie.

121
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,842
I always go alone,

122
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,698
so I would be very happy
if we could go together.

123
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,825
The matchmaking is progressing smoothly.

124
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:47,809
There should be no need to worry.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,288
To go see a movie!

126
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,185
The cinema… The couple's seat…

127
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:56,345
In the dim light.

128
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,847
I'm so shy.

129
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:02,081
You're about to become a demon, Akagami!

130
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,417
No, no, I'm Cupid.

131
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:08,169
What do you usually do on your day off?

132
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,234
I go to the hot springs to relax.

133
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,422
Hot! Springs!

134
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,139
Can I get in with you?

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,740
HEAVENLY MATCH
Akagami, are you okay?

136
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,270
I'm fine, don't worry.

137
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,172
May I ask, sir,

138
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,843
what are your wishes
after getting married?

139
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,448
I want to have about ten children.

140
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:38,614
I want a baby.

141
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,757
Akagami!

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,432
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

143
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,713
As you'd expect from Miss Aoba's friend.

144
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:56,834
Though I don't know why he is here,

145
00:08:57,694 --> 00:08:59,870
I'm sure he is not here to cause trouble.

146
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,086
I have full trust in
my ability to judge people.

147
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,841
He must be genuinely worried about you.

148
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,313
After all, his words and deeds
are without a shred of deceit.

149
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,374
Deceit?

150
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,405
Remember, Yuzuki,

151
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:18,839
lying is bad.

152
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:23,241
Indeed, lying is wrong.

153
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,588
What's the matter?

154
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,340
Mr. Kijou, I'm sorry.

155
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,614
Actually,

156
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,302
I have no plans to get married.

157
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:36,451
So you are looking for an abbot

158
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:38,655
to inherit Mikazuki Temple?

159
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:41,699
Is that why you came for matchmaking?

160
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:45,333
I know my motives aren't pure, but…

161
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,516
It's fine. He's a monk anyway.

162
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,254
It's no problem to have
matchmaking in name only.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,832
But…

164
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:59,544
HEAD TEMPLE
The key is to buy some time before you become a nun.

165
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,503
So, you can just stay engaged,

166
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,509
and break it off after three years.

167
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,522
Isn't that kind of like fraud?

168
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,211
What are you talking about?

169
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:11,461
You're giving that man a dream
of marrying a beautiful girl.

170
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,061
No, this is definitely fraud.

171
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:17,037
If you do fall in love,
you can get married too.

172
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,145
What if he is in a hurry to get married?

173
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:22,654
I want to finish my studies first.

174
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,876
You can just brush him off with that.

175
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,335
I see, I'll try it.

176
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,764
That's the spirit.

177
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:35,500
Give those unpopular,
unwanted monks a nice dream.

178
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:38,321
Kiki, did something happen
between you and some monks?

179
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,170
I see, you mean…

180
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,818
To prevent the temple from closing down,
you want someone who can help you, right?

181
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:46,793
Yes.

182
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:49,918
That's why you came to the matchmaking.

183
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,970
I'm really sorry!
I know it's terrible to lie.

184
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,199
But,

185
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,226
I know this is a shameless request,

186
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,516
but could you please get engaged with me?

187
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,630
Please give me… give us some time.

188
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,311
HEAVENLY MATCH
You're a very honest person.

189
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,127
HEAVENLY MATCH
I like people like you.

190
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,427
But you're still a child.

191
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,436
As far as I know,

192
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:20,091
Mikazuki Temple has been lacking funds
and manpower for many years.

193
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,639
I heard they don't even have money
to properly repair the main hall.

194
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,860
I…

195
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,935
Can you satisfy the believers
who come to worship with that?

196
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,990
You can't save others when
you can't even save yourself.

197
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,780
Keeping the temple going

198
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,500
won't make anyone happy.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,848
The person who made the
decision to abandon the temple

200
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:41,709
probably thought the same way.

201
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:44,921
Anyone…

202
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,866
But they…

203
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,661
Face the reality.

204
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,859
Mikazuki Temple has no value to protect.

205
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:00,495
Even so, I want to inherit that…

206
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,659
Is it because of my family's debt?

207
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,090
If the situation has
deteriorated to this point,

208
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:08,344
at least let me use this life

209
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,597
to redeem the reputation
of Mikazuki Temple.

210
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,185
That would make it even worse, Akagami.

211
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,774
Sir,

212
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,749
can we start the matchmaking again?

213
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:22,294
Your name is Akagami, right?

214
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,682
It's not a bad thing for you
to abandon the temple.

215
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,859
You can repay the debt slowly.

216
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:33,507
Without the temple, you don't
have to do forced labor there.

217
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:36,605
I see, for Akagami…

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,008
Then we'll end this matter here.

219
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:46,818
I told you, the Mikazuki
Temple is no longer…

220
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,716
That temple and Miss Yuzuki

221
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,592
saved me twice.

222
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:52,985
Akagami.

223
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,756
That temple is not

224
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,473
without value.

225
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:00,364
You mean we should keep it?

226
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,068
Yes.

227
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,708
Even if it means Miss Yuzuki
has to work harder?

228
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,954
Running a temple is no easy task!

229
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:10,298
Not just her,

230
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,605
it will also cause trouble
for her family and believers.

231
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,927
What if it fails? What if the
situation keeps getting worse?

232
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,292
What if she can't endure it anymore?

233
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,782
I will support her.

234
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,547
Oh, can you promise?

235
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,567
Can you swear to make Aoba Yuzuki
happy till death do you part?

236
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,460
I swear!

237
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,701
Can you swear to be with her
in sickness and in health?

238
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:39,563
I swear!

239
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:40,727
Wait… this isn't…

240
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,100
Can you swear that, from now on,
you will always consider each other,

241
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,081
and build a happy family?

242
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,188
I swear!

243
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,516
A…proposal…

244
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,344
HEAVENLY MATCH
Then show me

245
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:53,648
HEAVENLY MATCH
the value of Mikazuki Temple.

246
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,080
Let's see if your naive ideal

247
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:59,202
can defeat the harsh reality.

248
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,490
Alright, Miss Aoba Yuzuki.

249
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:05,249
Yes!

250
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,221
I accept the engagement.

251
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,317
But, I'm only lending you my name.

252
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,477
Thank you very much.

253
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,022
Houan.

254
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,048
About abandoning the temple,

255
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,822
I have asked you to convince them, right?

256
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,996
Because there's a very interesting
person, I couldn't help but…

257
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,620
You took an interest
in him too, didn't you?

258
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,052
That's why you got him
involved in this matchmaking.

259
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,290
Right, Abbot Aoba?

260
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:41,396
Akagami,

261
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,406
is he the son of that man?

262
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:49,398
CONTENTMENT BRINGS HAPPINESS
(TenPuru -No one can live on loneliness-)

263
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,895
We didn't catch the bus.

264
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,863
Let's just walk to the station then.

265
00:14:58,271 --> 00:14:59,743
I'm sorry for all the
things that happened.

266
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:00,923
What do you mean?

267
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,617
By the way, it's great that
the date is successful.

268
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:09,727
So it's just an engagement, not marriage?

269
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:11,900
In that case,

270
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,413
I won't need to move out of the temple.

271
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,902
Of course.

272
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,511
That's great!

273
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,436
Miss Yuzuki?

274
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:32,718
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,904
I don't know how to face you right now.

276
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,796
Thank you, Akagami.

277
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:42,698
Tears in your eyes, cheeks flushed.

278
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,787
Why are you spying?

279
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,930
Are you not feeling well?

280
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,236
Not at all, idiot!

281
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,534
TRAINS ON PLATFORM TWO
TODAY'S OPERATION HAS ENDED

282
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,795
The last train departing
from this station

283
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:56,089
has already left.

284
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,651
The exit will be closed soon.

285
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,087
Please leave the station

286
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:03,920
as quickly as possible.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,536
-Let's call a taxi.
-Right!

288
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,178
There are no taxis at all.

289
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:16,212
There isn't a single car on the road.

290
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:17,823
And my phone is dead.

291
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,387
Did you bring your phone?

292
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:21,975
I smashed it a long time ago.

293
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,533
Why would you do that?

294
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,356
What should we do?
It's starting to get cold.

295
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,918
Ow!

296
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,016
My feet hurt.

297
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:34,190
This won't do. We need
to find a place to rest.

298
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:39,973
SILK ROAD, AIM FOR NIRVANA
LOVE HOTEL

299
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,364
No, no, no!

300
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:47,641
This is not an invitation.

301
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,962
This is definitely not an invitation,
Akagami Akemitsu.

302
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:54,241
So, calm down, my worldly desires.

303
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:55,588
Akagami,

304
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,552
should we go take a look?

305
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:00,531
Miss Yuzuki!

306
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,546
SILK ROAD, AIM FOR NIRVANA
LOVE HOTEL

307
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,885
What a frivolous thought!

308
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,557
No, I don't mean anything weird!

309
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,076
Look, there are no other
hotels around here.

310
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,053
That's not the problem here!

311
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,576
ROOM 205, REST 1000, STAY 2000
A young man and woman.

312
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,859
Just casually checking into a love hotel.

313
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,589
We checked in nonetheless!

314
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,556
Looks amazing, Akagami!

315
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,924
Yeah.

316
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:26,278
It's more luxurious than I thought!

317
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:27,828
Indeed.

318
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,078
It seems we can order food here.

319
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,499
You're in a good mood, Miss Yuzuki.

320
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:35,107
If we keep this up,
things won't get weird.

321
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,670
We can even sing K and play games.

322
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,832
There's even karaoke and games.

323
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,964
Akagami, look at this!

324
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,731
COSPLAY, FREE TO RENT
There are even costumes for cosplay!

325
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,666
Miss Yuzuki!

326
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,369
Why?

327
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:53,313
Why must you stir up my worldly desires?

328
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:55,615
Calm down.

329
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,633
Miss Yuzuki is probably
trying to lighten the mood.

330
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:00,105
We can also watch movies.

331
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:02,081
Even AV is free to watch.

332
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,725
Worldly desires, begone!

333
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,790
WORLDLY DESIRES, BEGONE
Sorry, I got carried away.

334
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,960
Akagami,

335
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,178
you go take a shower first.

336
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,377
She really meant it!

337
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:37,843
No, what nonsense am I talking?

338
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,022
Why would Miss Yuzuki seduce me?

339
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,733
Asking me to take a shower first,

340
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,909
she must be caring for me
and letting me have a rest.

341
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,337
That's right, there's definitely
no wicked motive behind.

342
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,290
Miss Yuzuki, I'm done.

343
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,697
What's wrong?

344
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,121
Nothing.

345
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,352
I'll go now.

346
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:18,689
Miss Yuzuki was watching AV?

347
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,527
No, no, no.

348
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:25,081
She wanted to watch AV, is that why
she asked me to take a shower first?

349
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,360
How could this be?

350
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:28,429
That's right, Akagami.

351
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,381
Sis Yuzuki can be quite pervy too.

352
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,368
And she's the type who
keeps it to herself.

353
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,908
What should I do?

354
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,589
What's there to worry about?

355
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,145
AKAGAMI LEWDMITSU
Is there any other option other than to pounce on her?

356
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,107
ENLIGHTENED AKEMITSU
Isn't that what she wished for?

357
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,337
This is where you need
to show your manliness!

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,872
You can't let the girl feel embarrassed.

359
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,043
Their opinions actually align.

360
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,063
You need to follow your heart.

361
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,267
You want to become one
with her too, don't you?

362
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,835
Shut up!

363
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:01,991
Violence is not right.

364
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,740
Why not take the step into adulthood?

365
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,140
Damn it!

366
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,296
I've already sworn to support her.

367
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:16,216
I…I want to

368
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,375
protect her.

369
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:25,093
So that's what AV is.

370
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,609
The bathroom is so spacious.

371
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:34,899
What is it for?

372
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,974
I can't believe we really ended
up staying in a love hotel.

373
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,718
What should I do? what should I do?

374
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,465
Anyway, I need to warm
up and calm down first.

375
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:49,763
Why do I feel even more shy

376
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:52,283
after calming down?!

377
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,154
What am I getting excited about?

378
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,945
I let Akagami stay in too,

379
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,574
doesn't it look like I'm
expecting something to happen?

380
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,902
This could cause a misunderstanding.

381
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:06,747
How should I face Akagami from now on?

382
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,530
I will support her.

383
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:15,842
I swear!

384
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,110
If

385
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:28,698
Akagami sincerely

386
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,756
asks me,

387
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,164
I…

388
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:46,259
Please rest assured.

389
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:50,094
Miss Yuzuki, there won't
be any danger for you.

390
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:54,707
Please rest well.

391
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,871
Miss Yuzuki, why are you
putting a blindfold on me?

392
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,803
Miss Yuzuki? Hey, Miss Yuzuki?

393
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:08,779
I can't even go to the bathroom like this.

394
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,438
Miss Yuzuki?

395
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:12,833
Hey, are you still there?

396
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,714
SILK ROAD, AIM FOR NIRVANA, LOVE HOTEL
Idiot.

397
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,225
I hit it.

398
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,075
I've got it!

399
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,097
You're talking about archery, right?

400
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:57,670
You're staring too intently.

401
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:59,695

Take Responsibility for Me?)
