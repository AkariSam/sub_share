1
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:07,128
<i>I've killed 13 people up until now.</i>

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,846
<i>I consider myself stronger
than any random idiot off the street.</i>

3
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,893
<i>Killing is fun.</i>

4
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:27,690
<i>Talk about the look on that face</i>

5
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:30,025
<i>of the bratty little jarl.</i>

6
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:34,905
<i>That's why I know...</i>

7
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:38,451
<i>This row of enemies</i>

8
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:40,953
<i>in front of me...</i>

9
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:53,591
<i>I'm scared! I'm scared!</i>

10
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:56,719
<i>Damn it! They are enjoying this!</i>

11
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,027
Damn it!

12
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:18,949
Gudmund!

13
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:24,747
My legs...

14
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,169
<i>Badger is going to be killed!</i>

15
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:32,922
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

16
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:36,175
<i>How can he get so close
to the Jomsvikings?</i>

17
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:48,896
Boss!

18
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:52,733
Fox! Take Badger and return to the fort!

19
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,531
I'm ordering the entire army to retreat!

20
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:02,535
You must be kidding! I can still fight!

21
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:06,247
That's enough, Badger.
Take a look around you.

22
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:12,336
Damn it! They need this many people to die
just to realize how unmatched they are.

23
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:16,006
Retreat!

24
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:19,635
- What? Retreat?
- Yes!

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,890
Don't stay together! Spread out and run!

26
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:28,894
Wait! My legs...

27
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:31,397
Did you say, "retreat"?

28
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:35,776
I did not give that order! Shame on you!

29
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:38,612
How can you call yourselves Nordic men?

30
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:39,613
Wait for me!

31
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:45,369
I told you not to run away!

32
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:50,499
Do you expect me to write off your debt
with this level of service?

33
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:58,007
Who cares about the debt.
You are done for, Ketil.

34
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:05,431
Does this give you a little taste
of what it's like to be poor like us?

35
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:09,310
No matter how unfair it is,

36
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,563
you shouldn't have disobeyed the king.

37
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,693
Just as we obeyed you.

38
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:22,323
Power is justice, Ketil.

39
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:28,621
This world exists for people
who are more powerful than you.

40
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:37,963
They're here!

41
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,519
- What's wrong, Wulf?
- Your Majesty.

42
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,150
A subordinate of mine
just killed a man whom I think was Ketil.

43
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:00,444
That was a poor decision.

44
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,030
Did I not order them to capture him?

45
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:06,450
Yes, I am terribly sorry.

46
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:08,661
I will go check on that.

47
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:14,625
The Jomsvikings are killing those who
escape, which is also against my orders.

48
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,545
- Tell Floki to stop going after them.
- Yes.

49
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:32,977
<i>For some reason,
the captain is walking away.</i>

50
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:35,813
<i>It's my chance!</i>

51
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:38,524
<i>Go!</i>

52
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:44,863
Be careful with the bodies.
We will return them to their families...

53
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,371
Canute!

54
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:55,874
Off with your head!

55
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:41,939
Thorgil! Where did you come from!

56
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:46,193
From the underworld.

57
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,449
What a surprise.

58
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,744
Who knew you could withstand my attack.

59
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:58,622
You've improved, Your Majesty.

60
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:01,875
<i>My right hand is limp.</i>

61
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,129
<i>Did I sprain it just now?</i>

62
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,047
That's the spirit!

63
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,509
That's how a commander should be!

64
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:26,733
I'd love to play with you,

65
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:30,696
but I'm sorry. I don't have much time.

66
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:35,284
Let's start over. Off with your head!

67
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:53,469
You bastard!
How dare you treat His Majesty that way!

68
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:04,646
Die!

69
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:22,915
Your Majesty, please hand the sword to me
and stay back!

70
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:26,543
Damn it!

71
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:34,468
Royal guards, head back! Protect the king!

72
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,350
Damn it!

73
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,435
Wait, Thorgil!

74
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,690
Don't go after him, Wulf.
You are heavily injured.

75
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:55,822
It was partly due to my carelessness,
but more than that, he is a bold man.

76
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,451
I want him as my subordinate again.

77
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,914
Royal guards, return to your places!

78
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:07,125
King Canute was attacked.

79
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,044
All of you, go back!

80
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,922
Run! Hurry up!

81
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:15,425
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

82
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,844
What?

83
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:22,182
Who would do...? Was it Thorgil?

84
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:27,938
That was close.

85
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:35,028
Master! Are you alive?

86
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,284
Good.

87
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:42,703
Those soldiers

88
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,540
didn't know what the master
looked like, I guess.

89
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,292
You are lucky.

90
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:51,795
Damn, you're heavy.

91
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:58,302
Don't even think about
taking the easy way out by dying.

92
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:03,098
You will take responsibility
as the commander of a defeated army,

93
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,560
Iron Fist Ketil.

94
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,704
I hear those sounds...

95
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,336
The sounds I heard

96
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:36,882
when my village was burned down.

97
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:43,180
<i>The sound of the world falling apart.</i>

98
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:50,354
They are fighting a war, aren't they?

99
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,608
It's okay. Don't worry.

100
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,527
We're not slaves anymore.

101
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:00,197
We will leave this farm.

102
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:06,286
That battle has nothing to do with us.

103
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,335
After we leave this place,

104
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:16,046
where will we go?

105
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,010
Let's go to my village.

106
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,848
It's a bit cold, but it's a nice place.

107
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,145
Are there

108
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:35,023
slaves there?

109
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,318
Is there

110
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:41,363
war?

111
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:48,370
There was fighting in the past,

112
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:52,833
and I would be lying if I told you
that there will be none in the future.

113
00:11:57,254 --> 00:12:00,465
I will not go.

114
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:06,346
I am going somewhere else.

115
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:12,894
Gardar and the children...

116
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:20,193
<i>I had them wait for me...</i>

117
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:26,241
<i>because I wanted to say thank you.</i>

118
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:37,002
Thank you, Einar and Thorfinn.

119
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:40,881
Thank you.

120
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:47,971
The whole time,

121
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,686
it felt as though
I was lost inside a nightmare.

122
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,023
I was all alone.

123
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:01,610
<i>But...</i>

124
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,413
our morning chats...

125
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,168
Einar's

126
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,296
stories...

127
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,176
No! Arnheid!

128
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:30,138
Stay strong! Arnheid!

129
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:32,599
Arnheid!

130
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,021
Remember you said that you were going to

131
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:42,526
protect your unborn child? Arnheid!

132
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:52,285
This child already went ahead of me.

133
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:02,003
All of them died.

134
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,675
All of the people who were dear to me.

135
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,430
What is the point of living
any more than this?

136
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:19,980
There is nothing here anymore.

137
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:26,695
Why do I have to live?

138
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:32,409
I...

139
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,206
Because... to me you are...

140
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,881
Arnheid.

141
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:50,010
- Arnheid!
- Move, Einar!

142
00:14:54,556 --> 00:15:00,103
My father once taught me this method
to bring the dead back to life.

143
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:04,274
Einar, talk to her! In a loud voice!

144
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:09,154
Arnheid! Don't go!

145
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,575
I... really like you.

146
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:16,286
I need you!

147
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,915
I want you to laugh at my stories again.

148
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:22,542
Stay alive and once again...

149
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,503
Please live with me!

150
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:30,342
Please live!

151
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:46,316
Einar, that's enough.

152
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,420
Far to the west...

153
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,967
beyond the vast sea,

154
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:59,347
there is a land called Vinland.

155
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:04,894
<i>The land is warm and bountiful.</i>

156
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:09,983
<i>It is so far that neither
slave traders nor the flames of war</i>

157
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,901
<i>can reach.</i>

158
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,905
<i>There, I am sure you will be able to live</i>

159
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,867
<i>without feeling any pain.</i>

160
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:22,829
Arnheid,

161
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:28,084
come with us to that land.

162
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:33,465
Let's create a land of peace in Vinland.

163
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,115
You guys...

164
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,243
Why are you still here?

165
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:12,754
Stop, Einar!

166
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,006
Ketil!

167
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:19,844
Because of you, Arnheid...

168
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:24,724
I will kill you! I will kill you!

169
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:28,436
Stop it, Einar!

170
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,106
Killing the master will do nothing.

171
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,572
I see... So Arnheid...

172
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,326
Wake up, Einar!

173
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:44,953
Please!

174
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:46,704
Einar!

175
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:16,985
Einar...

176
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:19,445
your anger

177
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:23,700
will not subside
even if you kill the master.

178
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,662
Anger will manifest anger

179
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,832
and people will keep dying. That's all.

180
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:35,253
I was living

181
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:37,589
that nightmare this whole time.

182
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,635
Please, Einar.

183
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:47,599
Please don't put yourself
under the same curse as me.

184
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:24,427
Dad...

185
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:28,306
I know. Get ready to set sail for me.

186
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,173
<i>God</i>

187
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:07,303
<i>must be watching us even as we speak.</i>

188
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:16,145
<i>As we lose our friends,</i>

189
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:18,731
<i>as parents and children kill each other,</i>

190
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,609
<i>He is looking down upon</i>

191
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:25,446
<i>all of that from high above.</i>

192
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,297
Thorfinn...

193
00:21:42,964 --> 00:21:45,300
Wait. Where are you going?

194
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:48,303
Wait! What are you planning to do?

195
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:52,307
I am going to meet with Canute.

196
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,519
The master was still alive.

197
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:58,438
He's not even captured.

198
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:01,065
It's not settled yet.

199
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,737
I might be able to
prevent any more deaths.

200
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,949
That's ridiculous!
Let's get away from here right now.

201
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:13,953
Why do you have to go that far?

202
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,206
Thorfinn!

203
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,508
This time... This time...

204
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:31,179
Let me finally take you back to Iceland.

205
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:34,140
Please!

206
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:43,858
Remember you told me a long time ago?

207
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:48,029
<i>That our ancestors</i>

208
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:50,364
<i>ran away</i>

209
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:55,745
<i>to escape from the fighting
and ended up in Iceland.</i>

210
00:22:58,331 --> 00:22:59,540
At that time,

211
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,501
I thought

212
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:04,003
that was so uncool.

213
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:09,175
But now, I feel so proud of them.

214
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:11,385
Thorfinn...

215
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:19,852
When I took a quick glance,
Canute only had about 100 soldiers.

216
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:23,606
Even if worse comes to worst,

217
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:28,820
I will be able to at least
come back alive.

218
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,499
I'll be on the ship

219
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,669
and ready to set sail at any time.

220
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:46,712
Don't push yourself.

221
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,716
We will return to Iceland no matter what!

222
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:53,928
Thorfinn!

223
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:39,242
<i>"Courage."</i>

224
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:40,993
