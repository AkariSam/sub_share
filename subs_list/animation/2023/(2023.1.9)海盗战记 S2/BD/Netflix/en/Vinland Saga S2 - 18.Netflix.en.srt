1
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:17,680
The wind is favorable, Your Majesty.

2
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,727
If these fair winds continue,
we will be able to arrive at

3
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:25,104
Ketil's farm in two to three days.

4
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:30,359
In any case... To think that
the king himself is going to confront

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,362
some wealthy family from the countryside...

6
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:37,742
We, the Jomsvikings,
would have been more than capable

7
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:39,702
of taking care of it.

8
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,707
King Canute has his own reasons,

9
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:45,791
Floki.

10
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:50,296
As a vassal, you should refrain
from sticking your nose into such issues.

11
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:53,758
Jomsborg is an ally.

12
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:56,761
I don't exactly consider myself a vassal.

13
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:59,972
Please don't forget that, Wulf.

14
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:05,019
Do you think Ketil and his men will resist

15
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,313
against their king?

16
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:10,274
I can't say for sure.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,904
I heard that Ketil was so fierce that
he was named Iron Fist on the battlefield.

18
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:16,906
We can't let our guard down.

19
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,452
He sure didn't seem that way.

20
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:27,041
Humans are a valuable resource.
I don't want to waste them.

21
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,961
If Ketil cowers before my power as king
and surrenders,

22
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:33,089
that would be best.

23
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,426
Is that why you chose to
confront them yourself?

24
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:42,139
However, they are the ones who acted
so shamelessly toward you, Your Majesty.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,266
Shouldn't we punish them

26
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,977
and have them serve
as a warning to the people?

27
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:51,816
If they resist,
I don't plan to go easy on them.

28
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,248
"There's a tailwind.

29
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:09,583
However, the waves are high

30
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:13,671
and the land I seek is still far off."

31
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:11,372
Oh, I thought Master Ketil was back.

32
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:12,790
But it was Thorgil.

33
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:19,546
Welcome back, Thorgil!

34
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:23,634
Hey! Here's a souvenir for you. Catch!

35
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:26,637
Woah!

36
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:33,686
What!

37
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,437
A human?

38
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:37,189
Woah! Master!

39
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:41,318
Give him some alcohol and put him to bed.

40
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:44,405
Jeez, he's such a handful.

41
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:47,366
Hey, all of you!

42
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:49,952
It's no time to be drying fish.

43
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,412
Get ready for war!

44
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,040
Our enemy's army will be here soon.

45
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,876
They're coming to take over
this entire farm.

46
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,671
Gather all the men and weapons you can!

47
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:05,467
- Hey...
- What?

48
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,177
Who is this "enemy"?

49
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,847
- How soon are they coming?
- And what happened to the master?

50
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,598
- Hey, wait!
- What is going on?

51
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:12,975
Thorgil!

52
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:17,104
Before you start a war,
you've got to honor your side of the deal.

53
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:19,064
I don't want to be caught up in this.

54
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:23,485
Have that discussion with my dad.

55
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:25,070
I'm busy.

56
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,991
Olmar! Hurry up!

57
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,287
This will be your first battle,

58
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:36,206
so stay with me and learn how to fight.

59
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:39,418
Although, considering our opponent,

60
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:42,546
this may be your last battle.

61
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,217
Aren't you happy, Olmar?

62
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:49,970
You've been wanting to
fight in a war, right?

63
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:58,270
Get it together, Ketil.

64
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:03,692
You said you would purchase our cargo
at three times the standard price.

65
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:08,530
That's why we agreed to transport
you guys all the way here.

66
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,328
Arnheid...

67
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,205
What?

68
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,636
Hey, Ketil!

69
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:34,014
Wait a second, Ketil!

70
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:37,059
Come on, Ketil!

71
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:44,525
I'm sure it'll be all right.

72
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:49,321
Your gut is telling you, right?

73
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,242
This time,
I'm sure it's the real Thorfinn.

74
00:06:58,455 --> 00:06:59,540
Yeah...

75
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,460
I'll hope for the best.

76
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:11,802
A war? Here?

77
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:14,596
Within the next few days, apparently.

78
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:17,850
Thorgil said to fix the walls of the fort.

79
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,145
Don't make it sound so easy.

80
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:24,648
There's no way
we can fix this in a few days.

81
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:26,483
More like, who are we fighting?

82
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:29,528
The thing is, he won't tell us.

83
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:31,864
He said he'll announce it
when our army is ready.

84
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,616
No matter who it is, we have no chance.

85
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:36,827
There aren't enough

86
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,997
people on this farm
with experience in fighting a war.

87
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,124
And we lost

88
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:45,210
five precious warriors just the other day.

89
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:49,047
The guests

90
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,467
seem agitated.

91
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:54,720
Maybe the master has returned.

92
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,348
I wonder

93
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,142
what he will do

94
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:03,979
when he finds out that Arnheid ran away.

95
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:13,071
Will he punish her?

96
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:18,827
It led to too many casualties.

97
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:22,414
But

98
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:26,001
the master adores Arnheid.

99
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,589
He won't do anything too bad, right?

100
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:33,258
Yeah...

101
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,010
Maybe not.

102
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,971
She's carrying his child too, after all.

103
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,102
I'm so worried.

104
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,439
Do you think she's okay?

105
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,943
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:53,987
Don't be.

107
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:57,241
You fought Snake and the others, right?

108
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,077
You did it for Arnheid and Gardar.

109
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,582
You even went against your oath for them.

110
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,466
There are times
when you just have to fight.

111
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,345
Thank you, Thorfinn.

112
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:26,103
I like Snake.

113
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:30,691
I think he's a kind and rational man.

114
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:36,238
I didn't want to fight Snake.

115
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:41,743
And in the end, I let Gardar die.

116
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:48,834
I'm not smart,

117
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:50,419
so...

118
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:53,213
I can't explain it that well but...

119
00:09:55,173 --> 00:10:00,304
I feel like there may have been
a better way to go about it.

120
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:03,849
Was it really necessary

121
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:07,477
to hurt so many people
and end so many lives?

122
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:13,108
Did I even try
to find an alternative route?

123
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:17,112
There was no way.

124
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:20,574
So many guests were killed,

125
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,492
so Snake couldn't back down.

126
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,288
Even still...

127
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:28,790
violence should be

128
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,126
the last resort.

129
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:35,589
But...

130
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,677
what would have been the best thing to do?

131
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:45,891
Where did all of this begin?

132
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:50,228
I wish...

133
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:55,859
I wish I knew how to choose
the course of action that's best.

134
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,073
Nobody in this world

135
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,159
deserves to be hurt.

136
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,332
You're right.

137
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,544
You're exactly right.

138
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:31,228
Arnheid?

139
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:33,355
Where are you?

140
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:35,482
Arnheid?

141
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:42,948
Where are you?

142
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:50,664
Oh, what a surprise.

143
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:53,583
You returned so early.

144
00:11:55,627 --> 00:12:00,173
I heard that King Harald passed away.

145
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:03,510
Dear?

146
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:09,516
A... Arnheid?

147
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:16,189
If you're looking for
that shameless slave girl,

148
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:19,401
she was tied up
and thrown into the stable.

149
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,156
While you were gone,
she caused quite the trouble, after all.

150
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:30,287
She plotted an escape.

151
00:12:30,787 --> 00:12:34,040
Forgetting about
everything she owed to you.

152
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,753
"Escape"?

153
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:43,049
Arnheid?

154
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,262
<i>A man from her past came around</i>

155
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:48,180
<i>and helped her.</i>

156
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,683
<i>Many guests died.</i>

157
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:55,437
Two of our male slaves

158
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,939
helped her out as well.

159
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,859
What a wretched woman.

160
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,445
This issue

161
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:07,532
must not be swept under the rug, dear.

162
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:11,369
"Escape"?

163
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,085
Why...

164
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,047
Why is everything

165
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:25,675
slipping away from my hands?

166
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:30,222
"Escape," you say?

167
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:34,893
Why?

168
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:50,951
I never heard anything about this.

169
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,495
I can't allow you in.

170
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,414
It's true!

171
00:13:56,414 --> 00:14:00,126
Ketil promised me
that he will free Thorfinn.

172
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:03,171
Anyway, I want to see his face at least.

173
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:08,260
I want to know if the Thorfinn who's here
is the one I'm looking for.

174
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:11,596
I have to confirm with the master first.

175
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:15,100
Otherwise, there is no way I am allowing

176
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,894
anyone to meet someone who is detained.

177
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,399
All right, fine.

178
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,779
Hey, come with me.

179
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,156
Let's go find Ketil.

180
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:35,370
I'm sorry to bother you
at such a busy time, Pater.

181
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:39,541
No, I don't mind showing you the way...

182
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,673
Is there something wrong?

183
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:52,053
I'm afraid this is something
we can only ask

184
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:54,681
an outsider like you.

185
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,935
Excuse me, Leif,

186
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:03,315
but do you have a surplus
in your budget for buying slaves?

187
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,776
Well, a little.

188
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:10,572
After all, I was promised
to get Thorfinn for free.

189
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:14,576
The master always keeps his promise.

190
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,581
I'm sure Thorfinn and Einar
will be no problem.

191
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,668
But Arnheid would be difficult.

192
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:31,051
I know I may be asking for too much,

193
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:32,469
but Leif,

194
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:35,805
will you please buy

195
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:38,975
two more slaves in addition to Thorfinn?

196
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:55,867
Arnheid...

197
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:07,671
Jeez, this is boring.

198
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:11,758
There's a woman in front of me
and I can't even do anything to her.

199
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,265
Stop acting all solemn.

200
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:22,185
You know, don't you?

201
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:23,937
The master is just going to

202
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:28,233
spank you a few times
and forgive you anyway.

203
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:32,737
He is just so soft when it comes to you.

204
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,617
You're lucky

205
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:41,246
your punishment wasn't
left up to us guests.

206
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:48,545
By now you would've been stripped naked

207
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:52,257
and raped by us all
like nobody's business.

208
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:56,970
As a way to avenge
our comrades who were killed.

209
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:00,598
Otherwise,

210
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,393
our comrades
won't be able to rest in peace.

211
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,688
Don't you agree?

212
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:10,483
What are you doing?

213
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:13,486
Master!

214
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:15,530
You are back?

215
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:23,204
Get out.

216
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:27,125
I have business with Arnheid.

217
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,378
Master, I was just... um...

218
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:31,629
Get out.

219
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:46,144
You tried to run away from me?

220
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:51,775
Why, Arnheid?

221
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,651
Why?

222
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,585
Why?

223
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:14,547
Why don't you understand?

224
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:18,510
What was it all for...?

225
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:25,266
Do you look down on me?

226
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:32,357
I won't forgive anyone
who robs me of my pride.

227
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,193
Even if that someone

228
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:37,195
is you,

229
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:39,614
Arnheid.

230
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:46,955
Stop...

231
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:49,207
Not my belly...

232
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,211
There's a baby inside...

233
00:18:56,548 --> 00:19:00,218
There is a baby inside my belly.

234
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:03,471
Please have mercy on me.

235
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:08,893
Whose child is it?

236
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:15,567
I swear... I swear it is your child, Master.

237
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,986
It's true. Please believe me.

238
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,990
"Believe"?

239
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,828
You were...

240
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:31,624
You were the only one I believed.

241
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,757
Believe in what?

242
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,510
What does it mean to believe?

243
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,014
<i>"It's true"? "It's real"?</i>

244
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:50,018
<i>I didn't doubt it for a second.</i>

245
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:52,020
<i>And to lose it...</i>

246
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,523
I will not allow it!

247
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:59,527
I will make you pay, you thieves!

248
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:03,156
I will punish you with my own hands!

249
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:12,248
Arnheid!

250
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:20,924
Considering the gravity
of Arnheid's crime,

251
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:23,009
flogging is a valid punishment.

252
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,263
But if you keep hitting her,
it will turn into a death penalty.

253
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:31,601
Arnheid is your slave, Master.

254
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:35,188
You have the right to kill her.

255
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:38,233
Are you okay with a death penalty?

256
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:42,362
If you're okay with that,
I will let go of this stick.

257
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,929
Treat her wounds, Pater.

258
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,936
So scary...

259
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:21,109
Ketil! If you don't want
that slave girl anymore,

260
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:24,112
will you please sell her to me?

261
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:30,994
I heard you had two more slaves
other than Thorfinn

262
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:33,579
and that both of them are his friends.

263
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,873
I will pay you money,

264
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,793
so please give them to me.

265
00:21:44,924 --> 00:21:47,468
Who said I don't want her?

266
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:51,180
As for Thorfinn and Einar,

267
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,975
you can take them wherever you want.

268
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,146
But I won't sell Arnheid.

269
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:01,357
That woman

270
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,569
belongs to me.

271
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:33,598
She's alive.

272
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,934
But she's still unconscious.

273
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:40,897
I don't know if she'll make it.

274
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:50,364
No, don't touch her, Einar.

275
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:51,991
She shouldn't be moved.

276
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:06,255
<i>Unforgivable...</i>

277
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:09,801
Every single one of them is a thief.

278
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,678
Everything that I've nurtured...

279
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:15,223
Everything that I cherish...

280
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:17,517
They're trying to steal it away.

281
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:20,978
Dad! Where were you?

282
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:23,564
There's a ton of things we need to do.

283
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:27,151
Also, I need armor...

284
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:29,153
Hey, Dad!

285
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:41,165
Unforgivable... You thieves...
I will punish you.

286
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,756
I don't care

287
00:23:49,257 --> 00:23:51,759
if you're the king.

288
