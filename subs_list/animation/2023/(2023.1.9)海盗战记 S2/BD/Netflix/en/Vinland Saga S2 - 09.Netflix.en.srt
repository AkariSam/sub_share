1
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:28,607
What?

2
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:50,588
What a relief!

3
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,717
It was a dream.

4
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:58,596
That was terrifying.

5
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:01,474
I dreamt that Father was killed!

6
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:03,768
I was going
from battlefield to battlefield

7
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:07,271
and fighting huge monstrous men.

8
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:09,857
And to top it all off, I became a slave.

9
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:19,241
Thank goodness...

10
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,876
<i>It's so peaceful.</i>

11
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:47,144
What is up with him?

12
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:49,647
He's so persistent!

13
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:52,024
Just collapse...

14
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:54,276
already!

15
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,406
Damn it!

16
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,245
What's wrong?

17
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,081
Let's go all out.

18
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,167
Let us see

19
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,295
if we really are inferior to you guys,

20
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:18,092
once and for all!

21
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:27,184
I don't have time for this, idiot!

22
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:31,147
Damn it! This is enough!

23
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,402
You'd better be prepared.

24
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:40,573
A slave like you making a scene like this...

25
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:44,034
You're in for more than
a regular punishment.

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,257
We won...

27
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,959
Father!

28
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:03,799
You wouldn't believe it!

29
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,302
I had the craziest dream!

30
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:10,014
So many arrows came flying. And you were--

31
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:12,266
I smell blood.

32
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:14,143
Huh?

33
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:18,147
Who did you kill...

34
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,942
with that blade?

35
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,195
Huh?

36
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,616
It was to protect you...

37
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,954
This power was meant to protect you.

38
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,461
I'm sorry, Thorfinn.

39
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,715
There were so many more things

40
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:32,054
that I needed to say to you
and to teach you.

41
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,185
No...

42
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:40,270
Father.

43
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,901
I did this...

44
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:49,905
- I'm sorry.
- It's my doing.

45
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:53,117
I must leave you behind.

46
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:55,160
Father!

47
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:57,663
Wait! Wait, Father!

48
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,419
Now you know, don't you?

49
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,133
Nobody is your enemy.

50
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:10,843
Nobody...

51
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,345
is anyone's enemy.

52
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,823
Nobody in this world

53
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:35,075
deserves to be hurt.

54
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:39,329
Nobody deserved it.

55
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:11,380
Where am I? Valhalla?

56
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,249
They're laughing...

57
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:12,482
Bjorn...

58
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:29,583
You're still hanging onto there,

59
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,168
Thorfinn?

60
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:44,723
Hey, long time no see.

61
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:00,781
Askeladd...

62
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,577
You're really persistent, aren't you?

63
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:08,413
You came back here again?

64
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,668
Is this...

65
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:16,046
Valhalla?

66
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,760
Huh? Valhalla?

67
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,686
You think this is the underworld?

68
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,897
Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:37,067
The underworld is a much better place.

70
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:39,903
Take a good look.

71
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:44,741
This is the real world, as we know it.

72
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:50,288
This is a dump for the scum of the earth.

73
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,336
It's the final destination for warriors.

74
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:01,425
It's the ultimate state of warfare.

75
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:08,390
There are no winners or losers,
nor is there an end.

76
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:13,770
Here, everyone except yourself
is your enemy.

77
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,734
Everyone except yourself

78
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:22,737
is your enemy?

79
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:27,659
Do you remember, Thorfinn?

80
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:29,911
You were once

81
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,373
a citizen of this world.

82
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,418
For better or worse,

83
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:41,548
you became completely hollow once.

84
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:52,476
That's why you were
able to escape from here.

85
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:59,232
It may sound strange coming from
the very person who dragged you here,

86
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,194
but you are lucky.

87
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:04,946
It's not every day that

88
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:06,823
someone gets to leave this place.

89
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,953
I mean, take a look at Bjorn.

90
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:19,252
At one point, your vessel was

91
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:21,755
filled with the material of a warrior.

92
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:24,132
But it became empty once.

93
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,594
What is it filled with now?

94
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,601
<i>The same...</i>

95
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,104
<i>material of a warrior.</i>

96
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:45,195
I let my anger take control
and punched someone.

97
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:49,199
That's why I returned here.

98
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,870
I'm still a citizen here.

99
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,623
My hands are about to

100
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:59,084
give in as we speak.

101
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,420
I'm pathetic.

102
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,339
I never...

103
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:08,009
learn from my mistakes.

104
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,139
"I" this, "I" that...

105
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,520
Jeez, self-reflection is nice and all,
but keep your eyes open.

106
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:27,654
Something crazy is approaching from below.

107
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:48,508
Hey, did you just kick him?
You're ruthless!

108
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:54,264
Isn't the right thing to do,
to listen to their curses?

109
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:56,641
Curses?

110
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,272
That's right. Take a good look.
They look familiar, don't they?

111
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:09,487
Those are all people you killed.

112
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,126
Me?

113
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:58,286
You...

114
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:02,040
All of you...

115
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,585
I have no idea

116
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:08,463
who you all are.

117
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,342
When and where

118
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:16,096
did I kill each of you?

119
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,307
I can't even remember.

120
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,669
I'm sorry!

121
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,153
They sure know how to ruin the mood.

122
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:23,288
Come on! You have no time to weep.

123
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:26,082
You don't want to
fall down here again, do you?

124
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:32,088
Then let them hang onto you and climb up.

125
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:34,841
Climb up!

126
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:42,682
That is your battle.

127
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:52,901
Go!

128
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:57,530
Take those people you killed with you

129
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:00,784
and fight your true battle.

130
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:04,662
Become a true warrior,

131
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:06,414
Thorfinn!

132
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,045
A dream?

133
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,717
A true...

134
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:21,489
Einar! Hey, are you alive?

135
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,373
Yeah...

136
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,713
We won the fight.

137
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:47,432
We've hit rock bottom.

138
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:52,270
We're drowning in debt,
our wheat is ruined,

139
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,772
our bodies are battered,

140
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:59,736
and we are going to be punished
for fighting on top of that.

141
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,616
But you know,

142
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:09,871
it was so refreshing to see you
punch that jerk.

143
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:13,291
Ouch!

144
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:19,631
What's wrong? Are you in pain too?

145
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:30,391
Einar...

146
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:34,437
I have...

147
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:39,484
killed so many people
with my own two hands.

148
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,615
People like your family...

149
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,786
People whose names I don't even know.

150
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,498
People I had no grudges against.

151
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:06,177
And yet,

152
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,847
I punched someone again today.

153
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:17,605
This is the last time.

154
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:25,947
I will never hurt anyone ever again.

155
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:30,743
As of today,
I am ridding myself of violence.

156
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:33,955
I am starting a new life.

157
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,374
I have to start a new life

158
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,751
and make amends.

159
00:21:58,104 --> 00:21:59,480
I am going to

160
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:04,235
fight my true battle.

161
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,115
I see...

162
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:11,409
I understand.

163
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:16,664
I don't really get it, but I understand.

164
00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:23,921
<i>I am starting a new life.</i>

165
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:37,310
They're off the hook? That's ridiculous!

166
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:42,065
Master, this issue jeopardizes
the order within the farm!

167
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:47,278
This morning, Pater found this

168
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:49,322
on the field that was ruined.

169
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:57,246
<i>By the way, Trygve,
what happened to your usual coat?</i>

170
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:59,707
<i>Uh, well...</i>

171
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,336
<i>The field was destroyed by wild boars.</i>

172
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:05,088
<i>There was no fight.</i>

173
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:06,714
<i>That's the end of the story.</i>

174
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:09,509
<i>Got that?</i>

175
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:16,516
Thank you, Master.

176
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:21,104
You sure are tough, Pater.

177
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:24,982
Are you not the least bit afraid
of being ostracized by your workmates?

178
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:28,152
I've learned to become tough.

179
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:31,280
After all, I am a former slave myself.

180
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:36,160
Relax those muscles
or you'll exhaust yourself.

181
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:38,746
Let the weight of the hoe do the work.

182
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,209
Yes!

183
00:25:37,615 --> 00:25:39,367
<i>"The Cursed Head."</i>
