1
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,044
It's two people.

2
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:10,256
Is it the same duo we've been after?

3
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:13,175
The footprints look similar.

4
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:17,054
Jeez, why does this happen
when the master is out?

5
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,390
What's the damage?

6
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:24,311
One bag of wheat flour and dried meat.

7
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:27,690
It's no good, Boss.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,694
Their footprints are mixed with
other footprints so we can't track them.

9
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:33,195
Oh well...

10
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,906
They don't take much,

11
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:38,159
but this is becoming a bad habit.

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,203
Do they think
we don't notice or something?

13
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,960
We have no choice
but to teach them a lesson, I guess.

14
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:30,062
That's amazing!

15
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:32,940
The old master must be very fond of you.

16
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:38,279
- You think so?
- Of course.

17
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:40,364
He lends you horses and equipment

18
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,658
and even lets you eat at the same table.

19
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:47,162
Yeah, but that's just our reward
for doing his chores.

20
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,708
We're slaves, remember?

21
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,627
Normally, we don't get any reward.

22
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:56,463
I see...

23
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:02,928
Now that you mention it, that's true.

24
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:04,930
You see?

25
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,101
But... why would he be fond of me?

26
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:15,441
- Um...
- Sorry...

27
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:20,779
It's because you are a good man.
But it seems you aren't aware of that.

28
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:26,202
What...?

29
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:30,497
What? No, well... Oh, please...

30
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:31,707
Einar.

31
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:34,084
- See you later.
- I'm nothing like that...

32
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,463
Huh? Oh...

33
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:42,259
Is he trying to be nice?

34
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:48,974
He's also a good guy.
Even though he's quiet.

35
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:50,100
Yes.

36
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,602
Arnheid!

37
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:54,313
Oh no, it's the mistress.

38
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:57,816
- Sorry for taking your time.
- No, don't be.

39
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:59,818
Now that I have someone to talk to,

40
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:02,571
I have something to
look forward to every morning.

41
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:06,575
See you.

42
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,954
Yes, see you tomorrow morning.

43
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,630
She called me a "good man."

44
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,549
I'm a good man!

45
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:30,975
You're out here fooling around
while breakfast isn't even ready?

46
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,351
Must be nice to be you.

47
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,728
I'm sorry, ma'am.

48
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:37,606
We didn't buy you just for fun.

49
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,109
Earn your keep.

50
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,860
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,823
My husband will return
from the town meeting today.

52
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:48,867
He may come home with guests,

53
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,744
so be prepared for that.

54
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,124
Well, I guess

55
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:58,335
a slave boy
is a good match for a slave girl.

56
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:05,384
Oh, they've sprouted!
These are wheat sprouts, Thorfinn.

57
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:08,595
They look...

58
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:11,265
so frail.

59
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:14,184
Is this normal?

60
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:16,186
Yeah, it's normal.

61
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:22,776
How intriguing.
This turns into bread, huh?

62
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:25,112
- Are you in awe?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,906
It's moving, isn't it?

64
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,785
Yeah, it's amazing.

65
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:35,748
We'll grow them and sell them,
and grow them and sell them,

66
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:38,292
and buy back our freedom.

67
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,336
No matter how many years it will take...

68
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,718
All right! I'm fired up now!

69
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,679
This is our first step toward freedom!

70
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,639
We'll clear this forest

71
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,726
and plant twice as much next year.

72
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,732
Hey,

73
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:06,361
we have the chance to become free
as long as we cultivate this field,

74
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:09,990
but I wonder what will happen to Arnheid?

75
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,580
I don't know. Why don't you ask her?

76
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,710
Is it okay to ask
about that kind of stuff?

77
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:26,090
More importantly,
what are we going to do with this today?

78
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,886
Huh? Oh, the wheat?
There's nothing to do for a while.

79
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:33,806
I see. Then let's start
cutting trees again--

80
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:37,392
- And so, we'll pray.
- Huh? Pray?

81
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:45,150
Oh, my God!

82
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,904
Let it grow! Let it produce!

83
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:50,572
Expel bugs and mold!

84
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:54,326
Make it rain!

85
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:59,540
- Now, together.
- Huh?

86
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,294
Pray... to what?

87
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:09,091
Anything is fine. Be it Yahweh or Freyja.

88
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:11,135
We need all the help we can get.

89
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:15,139
Just sit down.

90
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:22,729
Whether it's a good or bad harvest is,
for the most part, out of our control.

91
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,900
We have no offerings to make.
So we have to put our hearts into it.

92
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:30,320
Let it grow!

93
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,783
Come on,
put your hands together and join me.

94
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:38,662
Let it... grow...

95
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:41,290
- I can't hear you!
- Sorry!

96
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:44,501
- Let it grow!
- Don't be embarrassed.

97
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,045
It's more embarrassing when you hesitate!

98
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:50,048
- Y... Yes!
- Ready...

99
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:55,554
Expel bugs and mold! Make it rain!

100
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:12,821
This farm hasn't changed at all.

101
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:16,658
Are Mom and Olmar doing well, Dad?

102
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:20,913
Yeah, Olmar is doing too well
that I have my hands full.

103
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:23,957
He's itching to go to battle like you.

104
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,507
I see he hasn't changed since he was
a little kid. Too bad he's such a chicken.

105
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:35,135
Everyone has their own
strengths and weaknesses, Thorgil.

106
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:38,472
He isn't cut out for battle. It is best

107
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:41,433
for people to stay
where they're meant to be.

108
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:44,811
Well, you never know.

109
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,649
Sometimes the battlefield
can change a man, just like King Canute.

110
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,234
"King"?

111
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:53,278
Nobody calls him prince anymore.

112
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,865
He has changed a lot with this war.

113
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:59,535
He now leads the army with confidence.

114
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:04,498
Why don't you try sending
Olmar to the battlefield?

115
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't be ridiculous.

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,211
He can't fight with his level of skill.

117
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,718
Oh, it's the master.

118
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:19,054
Oh, perfect timing.

119
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:22,224
Is that...

120
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,103
Just as I thought, it's Thorgil!

121
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,482
- When did you get back?
- Five or six days ago.

122
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,443
I met my dad at the town meeting

123
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,153
so I decided to visit.

124
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,657
You're one tenacious man.
How are you still alive?

125
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:42,911
It's because you trained me, Snake.

126
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,290
Snake, what are you pulling?

127
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:49,585
Oh, that's right. Hey!

128
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,839
Come on, hurry up!

129
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:59,636
They're thieves.
I was going to hand them over to you.

130
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:00,762
Thieves?

131
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:05,058
There have been multiple cases of theft
that use the same tactics.

132
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:09,313
My gut tells me
they were all done by them.

133
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,652
Whether they're kids or not,
theft is still theft.

134
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:20,032
Please give them a punishment, Master.

135
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:44,598
Brother, my hands hurt.

136
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,893
What'll happen to us?

137
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,025
Are we going to die?

138
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:57,277
Don't worry.

139
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,529
It's okay.

140
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,491
I am with you.

141
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,037
In the end,

142
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:09,706
they call us an army,

143
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:12,667
but no one cares if you're an ally or not.

144
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,128
Once the battle starts,

145
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:18,298
each tribe attacks the target
on their own agenda.

146
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,511
As if to say, "I'm the most
daring man of the North Sea!"

147
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:27,682
<i>After the battle, there's a fun
pillaging competition.</i>

148
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:29,518
<i>It's common to see people</i>

149
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:31,520
<i>fighting over women they can sell.</i>

150
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:34,898
- Olmar.
- Huh?

151
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:38,568
How about it?
Do you want to go to England?

152
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:42,906
What? You don't want to?

153
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:46,410
Of... Of course, I'll go to battle.

154
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,829
I'm ready to show my skills.

155
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:51,415
That's my younger brother!

156
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:54,960
Maybe I'll give you a souvenir then.

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,296
- Hey, bring that necklace.
- Yes.

158
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:09,516
What is this? Dried meat? Can I eat it?

159
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:13,562
You can if you want,
but ears aren't that tasty.

160
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:14,563
Huh?

161
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:17,816
The ears of Englishmen.

162
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,694
Ears?

163
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:35,417
- Uh...
- You're such a chicken!

164
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,752
How are you going to get by like that?

165
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:42,924
We are sons of the Iron Fist Ketil.

166
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:46,052
Iron Fist?

167
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:50,557
You don't know?
Our dad was legendary as a youth.

168
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:56,104
<i>The moment he starts fighting,
his weapon becomes destroyed</i>

169
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:58,565
<i>because of his brute strength.</i>

170
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:03,945
<i>So from that point on
he fights using his bare fists.</i>

171
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:06,781
<i>And despite that,
he still kills the most enemies.</i>

172
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,496
What? Our dad?

173
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:17,167
When you talk to the older warriors,
they mention the "Iron Fist" a lot.

174
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,086
Show more respect to Dad.

175
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:25,133
You must be tired from your trip, Thorgil.

176
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,469
Get some rest inside.

177
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:32,015
- I'm not that weak.
- Thorgil...

178
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:40,482
Fine, Iron Fist Ketil.

179
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,985
- Master...
- What?

180
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:46,780
Pardon me, but can you

181
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,866
take care of that before you go and rest?

182
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,254
First, why don't you tell me your names.

183
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:06,466
Hey! Say your name!

184
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:11,179
Stop that! They can't speak
because they're scared.

185
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,389
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,018
Now, tell me your names.

187
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,356
Sture...

188
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,150
My sister's name is Thora.

189
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:26,903
I see.

190
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:28,697
Sture and Thora, huh?

191
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:31,408
Is there anyone who can
speak in your defense?

192
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:35,287
Their family includes a mother and a baby.

193
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:39,958
Their mother was sick in bed
so we didn't bring her.

194
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,252
We don't know where their father is.

195
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,922
What's your father's name?
Is he all right?

196
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,426
Answer him.

197
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:54,556
Our dad is named Snorri.

198
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:57,893
He went out to sell vegetables last fall...

199
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,814
and hasn't come back since.

200
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:08,153
Is your grandfather's name Bo, perchance?

201
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:11,031
Yes!

202
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:15,410
It's Snorri, son of Bo.

203
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,747
He is in debt
and owes you ground rent, Master.

204
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:21,625
Oh, that Snorri!

205
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,544
I was wondering why
he hasn't shown up lately.

206
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:26,922
He's dead for sure.

207
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:30,175
It's been a whole year.
He won't be coming back.

208
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,886
Some bandits probably killed--

209
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:35,639
No! Dad is just gone for a little bit!

210
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,900
<i>Families who lose their breadwinner</i>

211
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,029
<i>are customarily taken in by
other families as workers.</i>

212
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:54,032
<i>These children may have a chance,</i>

213
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:57,035
<i>but they come with
a sick mother and her infant.</i>

214
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,037
<i>Nobody will want to take them in.</i>

215
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:02,540
What is the matter?

216
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:07,921
I got something in my eye.

217
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:15,178
So, what did these two steal?

218
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:18,807
They have a slew of other offenses
but for now,

219
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:21,893
they confessed to stealing
one bag of wheat flour.

220
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,229
My subordinate and I
are witnesses to that.

221
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:27,357
You better not have
threatened them to speak.

222
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:30,610
I wouldn't do such a thing!

223
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,612
I did lay a trap, though.

224
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:40,495
Until this bag becomes empty...
That's how much time I'll give you.

225
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:45,250
If you own up to it, I'll go easy on you.

226
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:52,590
Our bags have
our master's name inscribed on the bottom.

227
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,428
That's the same thing as threatening!

228
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:59,055
Huh? No, it's not.

229
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:02,142
If he was innocent,
there would be no reason to confess.

230
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:06,396
Then that settles it. It'll cost one arm.

231
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,154
My little sister is still small.
Have mercy on her!

232
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:19,576
Then take on your sister's share
of the punishment.

233
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,911
We'll cut off both arms.

234
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,875
No... Brother...

235
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:30,378
Well...

236
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:34,883
I don't want to go back on my word.
Can you go easy on them?

237
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:40,513
Well, I think we've
come to a conclusion, Dad.

238
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:48,980
<i>How terrifying...
It's hard to believe he is my son.</i>

239
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:54,027
<i>Why did you have to steal from my farm?</i>

240
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:59,824
<i>I have no choice but to punish you two.</i>

241
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:06,831
I must object. That is the same
as giving them a death sentence.

242
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:11,336
- It is a punishment too severe for theft.
- Pater...

243
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:15,298
May I have permission
to give my opinion, Master?

244
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,219
Oh! Yes!

245
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:21,304
Go ahead, Pater.

246
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:26,434
As someone who takes care of
the finances of this farm,

247
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:30,563
I cannot agree with imposing
a severe punishment on the young boy.

248
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:33,942
If you cut off both of his arms,
we cannot use him for anything.

249
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:37,445
Sture, how old are you?

250
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:39,948
Twelve.

251
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:44,953
Perfect. That is the age when
children can start working like adults.

252
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:51,000
The amount he stole and his father's debt
must be collected.

253
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,420
Let us have them work and pay that off.

254
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,298
I suggest that we hire
them and their mother

255
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:00,969
to work as farmhands on this farm.

256
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:05,640
As for their jobs, they can work
as farmhands and cultivate

257
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,226
the land which you've
already leased to them.

258
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:11,563
I will provide
technical training to Sture.

259
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:14,190
If we raise him to be a proficient worker,

260
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,860
he will be able to compensate
for these damages.

261
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:20,738
And there will be no need
for him to steal anymore.

262
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:23,116
It will solve the root of the problem.

263
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:28,997
Absolutely! We need
compensation for the damages. So--

264
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:31,249
With all of that in mind,

265
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:35,003
I believe flogging
would suffice as punishment.

266
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:44,554
- Huh?
- Well, I understand the logic behind it.

267
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:47,599
Uh... Well...

268
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,895
Well, they're going to work
and pay back what they stole.

269
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:54,856
Their punishment will be
in the form of a debt.

270
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:59,444
We can't just let them go
without any form of

271
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,863
corporal punishment, Master.

272
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:05,533
We have to draw the line,
or else we won't be taken seriously.

273
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:15,210
Plus, nobody wants to be around
people with a habit of stealing.

274
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:18,463
You'll be doing them a favor
by disciplining them.

275
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:27,847
So, how many times will it be?

276
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,522
Five...

277
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:40,860
Ten... Ten times.

278
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,154
Ten times each?

279
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:48,284
We'll start with you, boy.
Clench your teeth.

280
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:52,163
- Brother...
- Stand back!

281
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,582
- Brother!
- Twenty times!

282
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:57,252
Hit me 20 times, please!

283
00:20:57,252 --> 00:21:00,296
So have mercy on my little sister!

284
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:06,427
Interesting! He sure has guts.

285
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:09,305
Dad, please let me do it.

286
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:13,351
What? But you don't know how to hold back.

287
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:15,436
- Don't kill him, okay?
- Yes.

288
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:18,189
- Make it light.
- Yes.

289
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:21,442
- Don't hit his head.
- Okay.

290
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:25,738
Lightly, right? Here we go, kid.

291
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,495
Brother!

292
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:38,835
- One!
- Wait!

293
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:42,130
Stop it, Thorgil. I will do it.

294
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:12,285
Where's Dad?

295
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:16,164
- It seems he went to bed.
- My, my...

296
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:19,459
Iron Fist Ketil is up in years, I guess.

297
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:26,883
It's a lie. The whole Iron Fist story...

298
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:33,181
Nordic men can't survive if they're wimps.

299
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:38,144
Everyone expects

300
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,772
me to be brave, as if it's a given.

301
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:48,071
No one would ever believe

302
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:53,701
that a prominent figure like myself
would tell such a lie.

303
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,960
<i>I'm terrified...</i>

304
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,963
<i>of my son Thorgil.</i>

305
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:08,925
<i>I'm terrified...</i>

306
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:11,427
<i>of war and violence.</i>

307
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:19,102
There should be nothing wrong
with being kind.

308
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:24,607
I understand your pain.

309
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,194
<i>You are the only one</i>

310
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:32,990
<i>who says that to me. You are the only one...</i>

311
00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:37,245
<i>whom I can be completely honest with.</i>

312
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:41,874
Stay by my side.

313
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:45,169
Without you,

314
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,339
this world

315
00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:50,883
is all darkness.
