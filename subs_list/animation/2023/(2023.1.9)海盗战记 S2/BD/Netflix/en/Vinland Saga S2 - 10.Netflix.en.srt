1
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:26,725
All right, here we go.

2
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:28,811
Ready...

3
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,078
We did it!

4
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:51,250
We finished the last tree!

5
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:06,223
Man, I can't believe it.

6
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,685
I guess anything is possible.

7
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:13,147
The two of us turned a whole forest
into one field.

8
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:18,235
Yeah, it took us three years...
no, more than that.

9
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:22,656
If only all of this land belonged to us.

10
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:26,744
That's the disappointing part
about being a slave.

11
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:31,582
We really worked hard.

12
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,501
It's almost time.

13
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:39,757
Yeah... The other day, Pater told me

14
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:44,136
that next year's yield
from this reclaimed land

15
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:47,306
will be enough to buy our freedom.

16
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,768
We'll even have a little extra left.

17
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:53,479
I see.

18
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:59,235
Einar, what are you going to do,

19
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:01,570
once you're free?

20
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,200
I don't know.

21
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,495
Even if I go back to my homeland,
my family won't be there.

22
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:11,997
Plus...

23
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:15,542
Is it about Arnheid?

24
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,296
Yeah, I feel bad.

25
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:25,261
<i>If only Arnheid could be freed as well.</i>

26
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:30,391
<i>Then I would be able to
enjoy this moment more.</i>

27
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:35,729
The master has no intention
of letting her go.

28
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,568
What about you, Thorfinn?

29
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:45,072
Are you going back to Iceland?

30
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:49,618
Well, I guess.

31
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,078
Maybe...

32
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:55,499
What's up with that?
You haven't decided on anything yet?

33
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:57,251
You haven't either.

34
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:05,467
My goodness... It's strange, isn't it?

35
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:11,056
Our freedom is finally within reach,
and this is our reaction.

36
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:26,196
There is something I want to try.

37
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,617
Huh? What is it?

38
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:33,579
Oh, well...

39
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:36,790
I don't have anything
specific in mind yet.

40
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:45,883
Tell me what you think, Einar...

41
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,928
Do you think

42
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:53,682
it's possible to rid this world

43
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,309
of war and slavery?

44
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:11,867
Well...

45
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,870
It sounds like a dream.

46
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:27,466
Oh, you've finally cut down the last tree!

47
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,843
Good work, you two.

48
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:31,470
Master!

49
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:36,725
Do you think you can grade this land
in time for sowing season?

50
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:39,269
Most likely, as long as we hurry.

51
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:43,899
Is that so.

52
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,236
All right, then I will
give you a little discount.

53
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:53,075
As soon as you finish
sowing the seeds, you two will be free.

54
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:59,164
You deserve it, Thorfinn, Einar.

55
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,466
Oh, you don't seem too happy.

56
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,136
Huh? Oh, no!

57
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,930
Yes!

58
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,308
Right, Thorfinn? We finally did it!

59
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:20,727
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

60
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:24,731
Oh, sorry. Don't get too excited yet.

61
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:25,774
What?

62
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:29,945
You'll have to wait until I return
to finalize the procedure.

63
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:32,239
Oh, you're going somewhere?

64
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:37,035
Yes. By the way,
have you seen the old master?

65
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:40,080
He hasn't come by here.

66
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:44,918
I see... Maybe he was
out in the field after all.

67
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,713
Well, you two will do.

68
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:50,549
If you see the old master, tell him

69
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:54,553
that I will be heading to Jelling

70
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:57,764
in order to visit King Harald who is ill.

71
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:02,311
But I should be back
in time for the sowing season.

72
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:05,647
So finish grading the land by then.

73
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,065
Yes, sir!

74
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,320
Have a safe trip!

75
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,364
Oh, I almost forgot...

76
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,617
You two!

77
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:20,162
Once you are freed,
would you like to stay here

78
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:21,955
and work as farmhands?

79
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:26,210
Hardworking people like you two
are always welcome.

80
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:30,297
Well, try considering it.

81
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:50,442
WHAT DO WORKERS GAIN
FROM ALL THEIR HARD WORK?

82
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:53,237
GOD HAS MADE EVERYTHING
FITTING IN ITS TIME,

83
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:55,989
BUT HAS ALSO PLACED
ETERNITY IN THEIR HEARTS,

84
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,575
WITHOUT ENABLING THEM TO DISCOVER

85
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:00,661
WHAT GOD HAS DONE

86
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,663
FROM BEGINNING TO END

87
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:08,043
OLD TESTAMENT
THE BOOK OF ECCLESIASTES 3:9,11

88
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:20,764
All right!

89
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:23,475
- Okay, let it down!
- Yes, sir!

90
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:37,114
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

91
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:41,243
This ship will arrive at Jelling shortly.

92
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:45,622
Please wake up, Your Majesty.

93
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:22,868
- Here I go!
- Okay!

94
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:25,370
- This one too, please.
- Whoa!

95
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,792
- Ready?
- Yeah!

96
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,377
Your Majesty!

97
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,921
You were here, I see.

98
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,800
The horses will be ready soon.
Please wait in the cabin.

99
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,218
I'm fine here.

100
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,722
I haven't been home in a while.

101
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:45,307
I want to enjoy the breeze.

102
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:49,478
Your Majesty!

103
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:56,777
I am glad to see that you arrived home
safely from England.

104
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,029
Yes.

105
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,365
Wulf, how is my brother, the king, doing?

106
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:06,995
King Harald's condition is not very good.

107
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:10,749
His illness has worsened
in the past month.

108
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,086
Now, it is difficult
for him to even speak.

109
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:19,007
I see. How long does he have left?

110
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:22,677
According to his physician,

111
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:25,055
the next few days
will be the most critical stage.

112
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:26,765
There!

113
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,101
Okay.

114
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:31,853
Good work on paying him a visit
as my representative.

115
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:32,771
Of course.

116
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,736
- Ouch!
- I won again!

117
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,822
That ball game...

118
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,199
When we were children,

119
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,910
my brother was very skilled at that.

120
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:54,376
Once in a while, he would play with me.

121
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,133
Hit it, Harald!

122
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:06,555
All right.
Keep your eye on the ball, Canute.

123
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:10,892
<i>Within the royal court,
there was hostility between those</i>

124
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:14,354
<i>supporting either of us
to become the next king.</i>

125
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:19,443
<i>But my brother himself
did not pay any regard to that.</i>

126
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,361
Ready?

127
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:23,363
There!

128
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:31,079
- Your Highness!
- Ragnar!

129
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:42,090
I'm fine!

130
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,758
Oh my!

131
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:48,597
See? He's tougher than you think.

132
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,559
First of all, you're a bit overprotective.

133
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,020
- Be a little more--
- Amazing!

134
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:56,396
Jeez...

135
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:02,819
How impressive, Your Highness!
Are you sure you're not hurt?

136
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,280
Yeah. Thank you, Ragnar.

137
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:09,451
It's hard to move
because I'm wearing so many layers.

138
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:11,995
And I'm hot! Can I take this off?

139
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:13,497
You mustn't!

140
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:18,084
As a warrior,
you must be prepared for anything.

141
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:20,504
Are you listening, Your Highness?

142
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:22,547
At any given moment...

143
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:26,259
<i>He was a strong and kind person.</i>

144
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,391
My brother has helped me many times.

145
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:37,270
I must thank him.

146
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,899
There!

147
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:59,125
Hey, kids! Play somewhere else.

148
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,628
I'm sorry!

149
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:11,429
You throw it too hard!

150
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,139
My goodness...

151
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,350
Children are so carefree...

152
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:19,020
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

153
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,194
It's nothing.

154
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,324
ENGLAND - DENMARK - NORMAY

155
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:34,286
<i>Sweyn's two sons</i>

156
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:38,415
<i>each inherited a dominion
from their father.</i>

157
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:42,627
<i>Denmark went to the elder brother, Harald.</i>

158
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:46,214
<i>England went to
the younger brother, Canute.</i>

159
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:49,175
<i>The two were on good terms.</i>

160
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:54,306
<i>When Canute was going to conquer England,</i>

161
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:57,976
<i>his elder brother, Harald,
lent him a fleet of warships</i>

162
00:14:57,976 --> 00:15:01,146
<i>and actively showed his support for him.</i>

163
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:03,189
<i>However...</i>

164
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,777
<i>shortly after Canute was
enthroned as the king of England,</i>

165
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:11,448
<i>Harald fell ill.</i>

166
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:15,785
<i>Harald had no heir.</i>

167
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,081
Canute, my brother!

168
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,085
So it was true that you were in Jelling.

169
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,880
Address me as king, Estrid.

170
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,841
I didn't expect your visit.
What a nice surprise.

171
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,471
It has been a while,

172
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,598
King Harald.

173
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:46,316
Harald, Canute has come to visit.

174
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:48,652
Can you recognize him?

175
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,113
It's fine. Don't wake him up.

176
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:55,617
I will be here for a while.

177
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:58,036
We can talk when His Majesty
is feeling better.

178
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,666
Canute...

179
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,428
King Harald, I am right here.

180
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,683
Please get some rest.

181
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:25,021
There is no need to worry
about the kingdom.

182
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,529
I was waiting for you.

183
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,282
I will...

184
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:45,542
I will hand over Denmark to you.

185
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,302
Now, don't be absurd, King Harald.

186
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:58,304
Please recover soon

187
00:16:58,304 --> 00:17:01,224
and maybe we can play
that ball game again.

188
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:05,812
You're really something else, Canute.

189
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:11,443
I don't know how you could
feign innocence and tell such lies.

190
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:15,697
Canute?

191
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:21,244
You're visiting the very person
you poisoned yourself?

192
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:23,705
It's quite the farce.

193
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,915
What in the world

194
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:29,502
are you trying to accomplish
by doing something like this?

195
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:34,841
Harald was fond of you.

196
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:38,303
Was there a need to kill him?

197
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,849
You two could have ruled
this world together.

198
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:47,353
It is not for the peace of the kingdom.

199
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:53,193
There is ambition dwelling in your heart.

200
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:59,157
Ambition to become
the sovereign over the North Sea.

201
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:05,455
<i>That is the curse.</i>

202
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:08,875
<i>The curse of the crown.</i>

203
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,588
You cannot escape from it.

204
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:19,844
<i>You will wear two crowns,</i>

205
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:23,515
<i>one of Denmark and one of England,</i>

206
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:28,478
<i>and suffer twice as much as I did.</i>

207
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:38,363
Canute!

208
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,123
What's wrong? You were zoned out.

209
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:50,625
Are you ill as well?

210
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:01,928
I'm fine.

211
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:04,264
I just got a bit dizzy.

212
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:10,145
Get a bedchamber ready.

213
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:12,730
King Canute is tired from his long voyage.

214
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,648
Yes, sir.

215
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:45,138
What is it?

216
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:49,434
I have brought refreshments
by order of Lady Estrid.

217
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:52,687
Where is it from?

218
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:56,566
Huh? What might you mean...

219
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,071
I don't need it. I'm not thirsty.

220
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,825
You fear poison

221
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:08,828
because you use poison yourself.

222
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:12,373
Isn't that right, Canute?

223
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,839
Coming out in the middle of the day

224
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,676
is very mischievous of you, King Sweyn.

225
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:27,847
If you can see me during the day too,

226
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:32,185
that means the curse
is about to reach its climax.

227
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:34,854
<i>He's talking to himself?</i>

228
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:37,440
How long are you going to stay there?

229
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,359
I don't need anything. Leave.

230
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,486
Yes, sir!

231
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:48,952
The unification of the kingdom
is a prerequisite for building a utopia.

232
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:52,997
Having two kings
will eventually lead to disaster.

233
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:56,376
It is necessary for King Harald to die.

234
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:02,840
Well, well...

235
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:07,470
You are starting to think like

236
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,098
a true king now, Canute.

237
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,606
What are you laughing about?

238
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,817
King Sweyn,

239
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,446
I used to hate you
and wish for your demise.

240
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:27,740
But look at me now...

241
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:32,203
The only one I can be
completely honest with

242
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,830
...is you.

243
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,334
Let's stay good friends...

244
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:44,090
as fellow cursed ones.

245
00:21:57,645 --> 00:21:59,939
Harald, one more time!

246
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:04,360
All right.

247
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,157
- Ready, Canute?
- Yes!

248
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:10,366
Harald.

249
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:17,248
We'll have a council of war. Come with me.

250
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,959
Yes, Father.

251
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:23,838
Sorry, Canute.

252
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:25,923
We'll continue this next time.

253
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,178
Thank you, Harald.

254
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:50,490
Become strong, Canute.

255
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:55,369
Stronger than me and Father.

256
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:57,371
Understand?

257
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:01,876
Yes.

258
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,065
All right, Your Highness!

259
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:26,567
I will be your opponent next.

260
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,694
What? You can play, Ragnar?

261
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:30,822
How rude!

262
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:34,242
I was once feared as

263
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:36,369
the "Lakeside Gullinbursti."

264
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:47,672
This is it, huh?

265
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:53,010
How underwhelming.

266
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:39,492
<i>"King and Sword."</i>

267
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:40,868
