1
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:44,100
<i>He's fast!</i>

2
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,481
<i>Faster than anyone
I've ever fought before.</i>

3
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:06,288
<i>And that sword...</i>

4
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:09,583
<i>He uses the curve on the blade</i>

5
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,086
<i>to make up for the difference in reach.</i>

6
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:17,675
<i>You've got to be kidding me. He's unarmed!</i>

7
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:21,554
<i>I'm a warrior from Miklagard,
for crying out loud.</i>

8
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:29,186
<i>"I have never once been glad," was it?</i>

9
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:32,231
<i>Jeez...</i>

10
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:36,986
<i>What kind of monsters
was he surrounded by?</i>

11
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,544
<i>I'll keep hammering him.</i>

12
00:02:58,382 --> 00:02:59,717
<i>You can't hit me!</i>

13
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,567
<i>- He's strong.
- He's strong.</i>

14
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:22,072
<i>Why is such a skilled fighter
working as a bodyguard on a farm?</i>

15
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:26,368
<i>How did a man like him become a slave?</i>

16
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:32,708
<i>No, I need to calm down.
I can't let him set the pace.</i>

17
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,628
<i>All I need to do...</i>

18
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,516
<i>He can move even faster?</i>

19
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:54,939
<i>I can see it.</i>

20
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:11,747
<i>He got me.</i>

21
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:14,875
<i>Gardar is...</i>

22
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:38,941
- Snake!
- Don't do it, Snake!

23
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:44,571
Don't kill...

24
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:47,491
Gardar.

25
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,619
Please...

26
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,455
let him go.

27
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:04,466
Get your head out of the clouds, Arnheid.

28
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:08,762
He killed five of my subordinates.

29
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:10,639
There's no way I can forgive him.

30
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:18,022
Snake! I will do everything that I can
to honor the deaths of your subordinates.

31
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:21,442
- Even if that means selling my fields--
- Shut up, Gramps!

32
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,444
It's not about the money.

33
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:30,576
It's true that
my subordinates and I are all

34
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:33,370
stupid, good-for-nothing,
small-time crooks.

35
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:39,376
We're vagabonds who can't even use
our real names because of past offenses.

36
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:43,881
Is that why you don't care
even if they die?

37
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,676
Is Gardar's life worth that much?

38
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:50,345
Is it worth more than
five of my subordinates?

39
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:53,766
Tell me, Thorfinn and Arnheid,

40
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:56,810
the difference in their worth.

41
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:09,656
That means there is no difference.

42
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,535
- Well then...
- No!

43
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,163
I will have him pay

44
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:19,666
a life for a life!

45
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,089
Are you still going to fight?

46
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,801
Will you get revenge

47
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:12,594
for Gardar?

48
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,520
You're the one who cut
Gardar's rope, right Arnheid?

49
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:26,316
You guys will be punished
for what you did.

50
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,112
I'll tie you up until the master returns--

51
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:03,562
That's enough! Gardar!

52
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,568
If you keep that up he'll die!

53
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:11,570
Gardar!

54
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,781
Damn it! How strong is he?

55
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,663
Gardar!

56
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:25,584
Let go!

57
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:29,338
Gardar!

58
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:42,100
Gardar...

59
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,563
Let's go back, Gardar.

60
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:57,199
It's all right now.

61
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:02,037
No one is trying to
get in our way anymore.

62
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:05,541
Hjalti is waiting for us too.

63
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,652
Hjalti...

64
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,115
Where

65
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:41,660
is he now?

66
00:09:56,633 --> 00:10:00,887
Your older brother
is looking after him in Birka.

67
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:04,474
I had him take refuge there
before the war began.

68
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,478
I see.

69
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:12,357
My older brother
is always taking care of me.

70
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:16,194
When we go to pick up Hjalti,

71
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,739
I have to take a thank you gift.

72
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:25,120
- Excuse me, you there.
- Huh?

73
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:28,832
Is this wagon yours?

74
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,084
I would like to borrow it.

75
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,130
- No...
- It's mine.

76
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,342
I'll give it to you,

77
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,385
Gardar.

78
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:49,102
Pardon me for speaking to you
from up here.

79
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:51,897
What is your name, sir?

80
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:55,275
I'm Sverkel.

81
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:59,863
Go on, back to your home.

82
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:04,910
Thank you, Sverkel.

83
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,210
Thorfinn...

84
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:21,176
Words cannot express my gratitude
for you and Einar.

85
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:24,554
This is reckless, Arnheid.

86
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:28,600
Gardar isn't going to...

87
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:36,942
It's fine.

88
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,449
Please send us off.

89
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:33,373
<i>It's cold.</i>

90
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,879
<i>I'm frozen to the core.</i>

91
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:53,810
<i>How pitiful...</i>

92
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:58,064
<i>Such unfortunate beings who were</i>

93
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:00,984
<i>abandoned by the gods.</i>

94
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,182
You are...

95
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:19,396
You are my new pride and joy.

96
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:25,193
Hjalti! Hjalti, son of Gardar!

97
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:29,364
I will continue fighting...

98
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:33,243
so you can take pride in my honor

99
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:36,872
and so we can become wealthy someday.

100
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,061
One second!

101
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:09,798
What is it?

102
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:03,435
For honor

103
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:05,854
and wealth.

104
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,108
Gardar?

105
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,534
How old

106
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,953
is Hjalti now?

107
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:24,873
Eight?

108
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:26,833
Nine?

109
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:32,338
He's six.

110
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:36,926
My goodness...

111
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:41,514
I've lost track of time
ever since I became a slave.

112
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:46,603
Six, huh? I see...

113
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:47,979
That's too bad.

114
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:52,358
I couldn't see him
at his most adorable age.

115
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:57,447
He was still one when I parted with him.

116
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:01,117
Man...

117
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:05,914
He has probably long forgotten about us.

118
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:15,924
Considering the fact that he's my child,
I bet he's causing quite the mischief.

119
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,511
Like setting fire to the horse's tail.

120
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:25,266
You did such a thing
when you were a child?

121
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:29,521
Yeah. My father got so mad at me.

122
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:38,029
When he becomes old enough,

123
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,200
he'll probably say that
he wants to become a Viking.

124
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,953
Like all boys do.

125
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,794
But I will not allow that.

126
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,561
Gardar!

127
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,162
It's okay.

128
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:31,207
I'm a little tired, that's all.

129
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,086
Just let me rest.

130
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:19,631
You're sure about this?

131
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:22,634
Yeah. We've made up our minds.

132
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:26,512
If we get the iron,
we'll be able to live comfortably.

133
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:28,431
Your family too.

134
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:36,439
- Okay. I'll go too.
- All right!

135
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,694
Everyone's gathered at the village square.

136
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:43,696
Come on, let's hurry.

137
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,306
Arnheid...

138
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:14,269
Hjalti...

139
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:19,482
I will never

140
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:23,111
leave you two alone

141
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:25,488
again...

142
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:19,894
I'm... home...

143
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:39,372
Welcome home...

144
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,417
Welcome home...

145
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:47,380
Gardar.
