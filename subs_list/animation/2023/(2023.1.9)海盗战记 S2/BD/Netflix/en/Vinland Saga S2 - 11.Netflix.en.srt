1
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:13,676
Oh, they're going at it.

2
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:15,386
This way, Your Highness.

3
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,513
His Majesty and Sir Wulf are here.

4
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:21,183
You're right.

5
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:24,186
Is that really Canute?

6
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:57,803
I can't believe he dodged that.

7
00:00:57,803 --> 00:01:00,014
King Canute is quite impressive.

8
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:02,641
How can he move in that armor?

9
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:06,353
Those are real swords, right?

10
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:09,815
Yes, I believe so.

11
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:11,692
Is this really training?

12
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:14,153
He'll get injured badly if he's hit.

13
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:18,824
- Look at him working so hard.
- Gunnar!

14
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:22,036
Hello, Lady Estrid.
How are you enjoying your day?

15
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:24,747
I'm not enjoying it at all!

16
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:27,875
This is so scary. I'm worried sick.

17
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,297
Please be assured.
Wulf is a master swordsman.

18
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:37,259
He is controlling his power
so that nothing happens.

19
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:42,598
It doesn't look like that to me.

20
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,726
I can't believe this.

21
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:50,397
Canute used to hate even touching a sword.

22
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:55,361
His Majesty awakened his royal blood
while in England.

23
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,154
It is very commendable.

24
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:02,284
A king must be strong above anything else.

25
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:04,161
Nordic men will not

26
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:07,915
listen to the words of a weak man.

27
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:14,255
But he looks

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,634
like he is in a lot of pain.

29
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:33,607
You retreat when you are tired.
It's a bad habit of yours.

30
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:36,443
When you retreat
it only prolongs the fight.

31
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:39,488
A true king advances and finds a way out

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,448
with his sword.

33
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:44,785
Not only are your enemies watching,
but your own subjects

34
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:47,955
are observing how
you wield your sword as well.

35
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:56,547
And Estrid is also watching.

36
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,384
You've noticed, haven't you?

37
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:03,137
I see...

38
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:06,348
So that is why you started to
attack with more force

39
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:07,641
all of a sudden.

40
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:10,853
Th... There you go again.

41
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,646
I will not fall for that trick!

42
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:16,525
Forget it. I didn't mean that.

43
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:20,154
And plus, she's too busy
talking to the man next to her.

44
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,757
You win.

45
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,013
Wow!

46
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,765
That was amazing!

47
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,895
Wow, I'm so surprised.

48
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:56,690
The score was five to one,
but he actually made Wulf admit defeat.

49
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,027
Wulf seemed to be
distracted at the end, didn't he?

50
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,995
Your Majesty, I've told you many times
that you must not

51
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:11,789
toss your sword like that.

52
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,042
That was an amazing duel, Your Majesty.

53
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,629
What is it, Gunnar?

54
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:22,883
We've completed the paperwork
regarding the survey.

55
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:25,177
I will bring it to your chamber later.

56
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:36,897
I must say, there aren't
many wealthy people out there.

57
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:41,360
Even if you were to squeeze
the people on that list dry

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,738
you would only get about
3,000 pounds per year.

59
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:46,657
Other than that,

60
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:50,452
the only option would be
to raise the taxes in general.

61
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:55,082
Oh, I recommend that one.

62
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:57,251
Ketil, son of Sverkel.

63
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:00,838
He is a wealthy farmer who owns
a massive estate in the south.

64
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:04,508
The military power of each family
is not listed on here.

65
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:06,302
Yes...

66
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:10,723
For that we would have to
go there and investigate in person.

67
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,936
I need to know those numbers.
Investigate and update me.

68
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:18,689
Yes, of course.

69
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:24,987
However, this will be a significant
tax increase immediately following

70
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:28,282
your coronation as the King of Denmark.

71
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,533
I am more worried

72
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,995
about the backlash
from the people of Denmark.

73
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:37,332
Making sure that that doesn't happen
is what politics is all about.

74
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,209
It's not impossible.

75
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:46,175
<i>After his accession
to the throne of England,</i>

76
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:49,011
<i>Canute was faced with a pressing issue.</i>

77
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,222
<i>That was obtaining a new source of funds.</i>

78
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:56,643
<i>Even after conquering England,</i>

79
00:05:56,643 --> 00:06:01,148
<i>Canute kept his personal troop of
Danish warriors stationed there.</i>

80
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,068
<i>However, that troop was being funded</i>

81
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:08,447
<i>by the tax revenue collected from England.</i>

82
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:12,409
<i>This contributed to the growing
dissatisfaction among the English people.</i>

83
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,247
<i>If Canute cannot manage to
scrape up the funds from within</i>

84
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,708
<i>Denmark, his newly acquired dominion,</i>

85
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,796
<i>he has no choice but to
scale down his stationed army.</i>

86
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,927
It's not impossible?
What options do we have?

87
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,929
We'll acquire more crown land.

88
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,139
You're going to reclaim land?

89
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,352
But that will take time
until we gain a profit from it.

90
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,479
I will gain more fields

91
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,439
in ways other than reclamation.

92
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:47,194
You mean by requisition?

93
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:50,656
Your Majesty, that is going a bit far...

94
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:55,619
We need money. We will have to
take some drastic measures.

95
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,621
At least it's better than

96
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:01,750
sowing seeds of discontent throughout
the nation by increasing the tax.

97
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,004
If you have a better plan, I am all ears.

98
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:14,596
Why don't we just
dissolve the corps at this point?

99
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,348
That's out of the question.

100
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,643
I am a conqueror and a Dane.

101
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:22,688
The people of England
don't think favorably of me.

102
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:25,899
The effectiveness
of my rulership depends on

103
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,735
whether or not I have a corps
that will do my will.

104
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,406
A king is a sword.

105
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:37,411
In a world like this, a king without
military power can't accomplish anything.

106
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:16,510
What?

107
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,722
King Harald passed away?

108
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:25,644
One week ago.
You were just a bit too late, Dad.

109
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,605
Wh... That means

110
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:31,692
by the time I left the farm
he was already...

111
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,402
I guess so.

112
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:38,657
I didn't know his health was that bad.

113
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,039
This is unbelievable.

114
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,626
And here,
I brought a mountain of gifts for him.

115
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:52,337
Three knarr's worth, huh?

116
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,132
How ambitious of you.

117
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:05,058
Wait a second, Thorgil...

118
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,187
The fact that you are here to welcome me

119
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:13,150
means King Canute is here as well, right?

120
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,653
Well, I am King Canute's thegn after all.

121
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:21,783
Right now, His Majesty is
at the palace on behalf of the king.

122
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:25,287
I see. I guess I found a silver lining.

123
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:29,541
Now that I don't have
the backing of King Harald,

124
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:33,003
I need to build a good relationship with

125
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,297
the next king of Denmark.

126
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:39,676
Can you somehow
put me in touch with His Majesty?

127
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:45,182
You sure have a tough spirit.
Okay, I'll take care of it.

128
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,726
Okay, I'm counting on you.

129
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:51,146
Olmar!

130
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,566
Hey, where did Olmar go?

131
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:58,445
Oh, the young master just took off
on his own and went into town.

132
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,572
You let him go?

133
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,741
I told you to keep an eye on him!

134
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,826
Come on, Dad.

135
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:08,830
He's already 20 years old.
He's not a child anymore.

136
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,123
He is a child!

137
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,628
That idiot is forever just a child.

138
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:18,006
Just imagine him going into town alone.

139
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,259
I bet you anything
he's in a fight right now

140
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,136
because someone bumped into him

141
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:25,847
and they didn't apologize
or something like that!

142
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:29,851
You're the one
who bumped into me, you jerk!

143
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,062
Don't try to fool with me.

144
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:35,023
You're the one who has to apologize.

145
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:38,860
Excuse me?

146
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,904
What are you talking about?

147
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:44,908
Look at what you've done!
I was going to sell this cloth!

148
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:47,619
Why should I care?

149
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:50,664
If this is a ruse to make me buy it,
I'm not falling for it.

150
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,209
What? How rude of you to think that!

151
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,920
But I will have you pay
compensation, though.

152
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,548
Now you're showing your true colors.

153
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:03,427
That was your plan from the start, huh?
You're a fraud.

154
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:07,347
- My goodness...
- You bastard...

155
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:11,184
How did your parents raise you to be
such a difficult person?

156
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:13,061
I am known

157
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:16,148
to be an upstanding businessman
just like my father!

158
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:19,192
- I will not allow you to insult us.
- Huh?

159
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,319
What are you going to do about it?

160
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:25,031
Want to fight me? Just try me.

161
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,284
You "crash for cash" scammer.

162
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:32,873
I've had enough! You jerk!

163
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:39,963
He took out his sword.

164
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:47,471
What's wrong?
Come and get me, you scammer.

165
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:49,848
Are you scared? Huh?

166
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:51,975
That's not fair!

167
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:54,060
"Not fair"?

168
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,688
When a man starts a fight,

169
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,900
he puts his life on the line.

170
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:05,655
The fact that you don't have
a weapon ready at all times,

171
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:10,076
means that you don't have the preparedness

172
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:13,330
of a Nordic man!

173
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,499
Then tell me...

174
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:18,460
Who do you think bought you
that "preparedness"?

175
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,586
Huh?

176
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:23,089
You idiot!

177
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,301
Why do you always have to
start fights like this!

178
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:28,762
What the heck, old man!

179
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,972
Don't butt into a man's fight!

180
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,602
Look, I'm sorry.

181
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,605
Let me compensate you for that cloth.

182
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:40,941
Is this enough?

183
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:48,615
Well, if you say so... I don't mind.

184
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:50,575
Hey, Bug-Eyes!

185
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:54,454
Give him back his change!

186
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:58,124
Oh, Dad... You were watching?

187
00:13:58,124 --> 00:13:59,751
I saw everything.

188
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,754
I was watching you in hopes that you would

189
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,382
defuse the situation,
but what a disappointment.

190
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:09,553
I guess you're still not ready
for big transactions yet.

191
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:11,096
Sorry...

192
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:16,101
I apologize on behalf of my son.

193
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:20,146
My name is Leif Ericson.

194
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:31,116
Oh, he's your adopted son?

195
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:34,369
Yes, basically...

196
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:37,622
He ended up at my place by chance.

197
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,542
Come on, introduce yourself.

198
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,462
I'm Thorfinn. Thank you for earlier.

199
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,507
Everyone calls me Bug-Eyes,
so please call me that too.

200
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:49,718
Thorfinn?

201
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:52,596
Oh, sorry.

202
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:57,058
It just reminded me of my servant
with the same name.

203
00:14:57,058 --> 00:15:00,645
He is a quiet, earnest,
and hardworking fellow.

204
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:04,274
Maybe I should've
named this one Thorfinn as well.

205
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,946
Well, your son seems to be very fearless.

206
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:18,580
Say, Ketil... If you don't mind me asking,

207
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:22,667
is this Thorfinn... I mean, your servant,

208
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,295
a slave by any chance?

209
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:27,839
Huh? Yes...

210
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,050
How did you know?

211
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:35,055
I didn't want you to take it the wrong way
so I didn't mention his status.

212
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,810
Is he Nordic, blond, brown-eyed,

213
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,314
and about the same age and build as him?

214
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:48,234
How surprising! That's exactly right.

215
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:50,820
He is a bit shorter, though.

216
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,531
That again, Dad?

217
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:58,078
He is from Iceland
and used to be a warrior, no?

218
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:02,832
So... Did he ever mention that?

219
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:07,337
I have seen countless
sword wounds on his body, though.

220
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:12,133
You shouldn't get your hopes up.
It'll end up like it did with me.

221
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,970
I know. I know that,

222
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,973
but all of his traits match up this far.

223
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:21,685
You seem to have a story, Leif.

224
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:24,229
If you don't mind, please tell me.

225
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,232
Yes, well...

226
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:29,985
I am searching

227
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:34,489
for my friend's son who became a slave.

228
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,785
It's been many years already.

229
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:44,374
Where did you say?

230
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:48,503
Uh, well, you see... I was thinking

231
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:51,965
about quickly stopping by Ketil's farm.

232
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:55,885
It's really not that far, I swear.

233
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:58,054
Ketil also came by boat.

234
00:16:58,054 --> 00:17:01,349
And he said we can follow him home.

235
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:04,519
How long is a one-way trip from here?

236
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,230
He said with fair winds,
it takes five days.

237
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:12,235
That means we'll lose more than ten days!
That's more than just a quick stop.

238
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:14,404
Please listen, Mord.

239
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:17,574
There's something different
about this time's "Thorfinn."

240
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:18,992
I feel like it's the one!

241
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:22,037
It's already fall!

242
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:25,832
We have to hurry back
or the Greenland Sea will freeze!

243
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,751
What are you going to do if we

244
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:31,463
delay our schedule for ten days
and meet bad winds and tides?

245
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:35,467
Sorry, but I can't humor you this time.

246
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,218
Please understand.

247
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,519
I'm so surprised.

248
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,191
I just put in a request yesterday,
and I'm already granted an audience?

249
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:54,986
I didn't know you were
so influential, Thorgil.

250
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,446
I have newfound respect for you.

251
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,535
Honestly, I am surprised as well.

252
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:05,330
His Majesty is a really busy person.

253
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,583
Maybe your tribute did the trick?

254
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,169
That is understandable.

255
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:16,049
We produce the best and most abundant
crops in the southern region.

256
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:20,428
Even the king will not regret
doing business with us.

257
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:26,059
Ketil and company,
enter the audience chamber.

258
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,521
All right, let's go, Olmar.

259
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:32,398
Mind your manners.

260
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:47,080
Ketil, I took a look at your offerings.

261
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,750
They were all of very high quality.
I will accept them.

262
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,671
Thank you, I am greatly honored.

263
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,881
Were all of those products

264
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,801
produced on your farm?

265
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:03,054
Yes, that is correct.

266
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:09,561
The late King Harald was also very fond
of our family's products.

267
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:15,900
I do not plan on pointlessly changing
the ways of my father and brother.

268
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,068
Be assured.

269
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:21,948
Prosperous farmers such as yourself
are treasures to Denmark.

270
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:23,449
Take pride

271
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:28,204
in the fact that you are a cornerstone of
the nation and keep on working diligently.

272
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,333
I am honored.

273
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:36,754
I deeply appreciate
your continued support.

274
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:49,225
You are in the presence of the king.
Kneel down!

275
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:51,769
Hey! What are you doing?

276
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,229
I am terribly sorry!

277
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:56,858
King Canute! I have a favor to ask!

278
00:19:57,358 --> 00:20:00,403
Please let me join your corps!

279
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:02,238
Preferably, as a thegn, like my brother.

280
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,660
I have been training.

281
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,745
I will be useful.

282
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:11,372
I can show you my skill here--

283
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,499
Stop, you idiot!

284
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,293
Don't unsheathe it here!

285
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:18,504
Let go, old man!

286
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,256
I want to go to battle!

287
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,592
This is the last straw, you idiot!

288
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:23,927
This is...

289
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:25,970
Shut up!

290
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,805
What shall we do, Your Majesty?

291
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,601
I don't mind, Ketil.

292
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:34,646
Let me see his swordsmanship.

293
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,398
- What?
- What?

294
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:50,203
That pig will be tonight's dinner
for the soldiers.

295
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,664
Cut it as if it was a human.

296
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:55,917
Yes... Here we go.

297
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:18,189
Hey, what's wrong?

298
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,315
What is this?

299
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:20,358
What's happened?

300
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:21,651
It's so loud.

301
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:23,945
Whose voice is this?

302
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:37,959
Stop. That's enough.
I understand very well.

303
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:46,467
Who knew bones... were so hard...?

304
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:51,806
Olmar, was it?

305
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:54,225
We will discuss your enrollment

306
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:57,770
as a thegn with the captain
and inform you tomorrow morning.

307
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,566
Until then, stay within Jelling.

308
00:22:12,326 --> 00:22:14,954
You really ruined it for us, Olmar.

309
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:19,751
Everyone in the corps is going to
make fun of me about this for a while.

310
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,589
Jeez... The more cowardly they are,

311
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:27,717
the more unpredictable they become
in critical situations.

312
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:31,804
Anyway, what's done is done.

313
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:37,310
Just make sure you don't embarrass
our family any more than this.

314
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:46,069
He's typical...

315
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,489
He has no skill but has a big ego.

316
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:52,533
He does not know his ability at all.

317
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:56,746
People like him are the first to die
on the battlefield.

318
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:58,956
I wouldn't want him as a subordinate.

319
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,127
I understand your opinion as a captain.

320
00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:07,799
Now, let me hear your other opinion.

321
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:14,931
That young man is very useful.

322
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:17,809
I agree. We can use him.

323
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:21,437
He's a typical Nordic youth.

324
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:23,106
A foolish one at that.

325
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:26,442
He will do exactly what we want him to do.

326
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:29,946
So we'll go with that plan?

327
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:32,907
Let it begin.

328
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:36,702
I have yet to be enthroned, but this
opportunity is too good to pass up.

329
00:23:40,206 --> 00:23:45,044
It is for the peace of the whole nation.
Sorry, but I'll need you to cry.

330
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,717
That man named Ketil

331
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:54,720
will be requisition number one.

332
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:39,033
