1
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:38,344
<i>Do you have what it takes to stop me?</i>

2
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:44,058
Just as

3
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:46,727
Askeladd did back then?

4
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:52,149
Please leave, Thorfinn.

5
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:57,363
You're a strange guy,
but I don't want to kill you.

6
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:04,912
This is how the world works.

7
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:09,083
In the end, whoever has more power
always gets their way.

8
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,379
Damn Vikings...

9
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:24,682
How foolish of you, my son.

10
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:28,519
You're still hesitant of becoming
a full-fledged king?

11
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:33,524
Why did you reveal your honest feelings

12
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:36,902
to such lowly people?

13
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:45,578
I hope you didn't think that
you could possibly understand each other.

14
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:50,499
They are a pitiful flock of sheep.

15
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:55,921
You are a lone shepherd.

16
00:02:55,921 --> 00:03:01,010
You raise them, cull them, and skin them.

17
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:07,933
The work of a shepherd
cannot be understood by the sheep.

18
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:11,562
You rule over them,
that's all there is to it.

19
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:16,317
That is the best thing
you can do for the sheep.

20
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,528
Canute...

21
00:03:23,574 --> 00:03:28,704
If you intend to use your authority
to forcefully get your way...

22
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,080
Kill him.

23
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,334
That man is a threat.

24
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:37,504
One sheep can confuse the flock

25
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:41,258
and send them running off a precipice.

26
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:43,594
I will...

27
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,179
Kill him.

28
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:49,099
Fulfill your duty as the king.

29
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:50,976
I will...

30
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:57,983
run.

31
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:18,420
Run?

32
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,714
That's it?

33
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:27,263
That's all?

34
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:32,309
What else can I do?

35
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:36,397
Do you want us to kill
each other here or what?

36
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:43,612
The paradise you speak of

37
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,573
saves the majority

38
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:48,742
and oppresses a few.

39
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,662
That's the way it is, right?

40
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,917
I can't say if that is good or bad.

41
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,421
And I have no right to condemn
your recklessness.

42
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:05,592
So I have no choice but to run away.

43
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:09,138
- Einar, let's go.
- You are excellent.

44
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:10,973
As a warrior.

45
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:12,641
You must have other options.

46
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:14,768
Did you

47
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,231
appear before the emperor

48
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,442
just to admonish me?

49
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:23,944
You got your face swollen for that?

50
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:27,573
And it was all a waste.

51
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:30,909
Goodbye,

52
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:32,828
Your Majesty.

53
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:14,828
So many...

54
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,665
So many people want to bargain with me.

55
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,794
Some even try to set me up.

56
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:24,338
But...

57
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:27,966
What is up with you?

58
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,302
You are such an idiot!

59
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:34,306
You have nothing up your sleeve?

60
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,935
You came here completely unarmed
and you got beaten to a pulp

61
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:41,271
just to tell me to stop seizing this farm?

62
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,569
Is it that funny?

63
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,571
It is.

64
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:53,617
This is the stupidest peace negotiation
I've ever experienced.

65
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,461
You're going to run, huh?

66
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,550
Yeah.

67
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,974
<i>Someone like him</i>

68
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:19,601
<i>can come from Vikings, huh?</i>

69
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,479
<i>What a beautiful man.</i>

70
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:31,655
You will turn your back on conflict.

71
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:32,990
Then run to where?

72
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:36,034
Somewhere other than here.

73
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:39,538
I can't tell you about it.

74
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:45,085
My territory is constantly expanding.

75
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:47,337
In time,

76
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:49,590
my authority may reach there too.

77
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,261
I'll keep running as long as I can.

78
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,097
As long as there is a place to run to,

79
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,266
I will not fight.

80
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,645
<i>I will build a land of peace</i>

81
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,315
<i>in a place out of the king's reach,</i>

82
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,067
<i>using an approach different from you.</i>

83
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:12,696
For the people who cannot

84
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,407
live in the world you create.

85
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,537
For your sake, and my sake as well.

86
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,835
Are you saying
that you will fill in the gaps

87
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:28,962
that my project can't fill?

88
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,467
Are you capable of that?

89
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:40,098
My power
is much smaller compared to yours.

90
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,935
I can't handle a gap that is too big.

91
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:47,856
<i>If you continue
to persecute people like this,</i>

92
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:52,027
<i>nobody will be able to help you anymore.</i>

93
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:57,074
So you better try your best too.

94
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,952
Don't give me more work to do.

95
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:06,542
My goodness...

96
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,087
You really learned how to use your words.

97
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:14,883
I wonder who you got that from.

98
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:31,525
Interesting.

99
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:35,946
This is the most difficult
peace negotiation I've ever experienced.

100
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,498
What... in... the world?

101
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,002
Even the ships are gone?

102
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:53,589
Where did you go, King Canute?

103
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,257
This is ridiculous!

104
00:09:56,925 --> 00:10:02,097
We still haven't settled this!

105
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:11,398
Floki was grumbling.

106
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:14,401
He can't comprehend why
we're withdrawing from the farm.

107
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,156
Are you also unhappy about it, Wulf?

108
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,117
Not at all.

109
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:27,873
I will call off our plans
of requisitioning other farms as well.

110
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:31,793
I'd feel bad if I gave
Thorfinn more work to do.

111
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:45,349
Up until now,

112
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,018
I thought you were the only one

113
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:50,729
who was fighting alongside me.

114
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:54,107
But today,

115
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:57,069
I found a new comrade.

116
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:12,334
<i>After this, Canute</i>

117
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,087
<i>disbanded the Danish troops that were</i>

118
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:18,840
<i>stationed in England and proving to be
a financial burden.</i>

119
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,932
<i>Ultimately,
Canute's personal force of Danish troops</i>

120
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:31,019
<i>was reduced to one fleet of just 16 ships.</i>

121
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:40,737
<i>However, they did not face
any rebellions within England</i>

122
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:42,447
<i>like they anticipated.</i>

123
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:47,786
<i>Because Canute relinquished
military power,</i>

124
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:51,790
<i>the peers of England
came to see Canute's trust.</i>

125
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,795
<i>The relationship between
the conqueror and the conquered</i>

126
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,797
<i>was starting to change.</i>

127
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:17,858
It feels good.

128
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:42,067
As long as you're alive...

129
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:44,361
you can start again...

130
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:53,995
Why do I have to live?

131
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,140
Thorfinn...

132
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:18,728
- You're all better now?
- Yeah.

133
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,857
I'm still a little wobbly,

134
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:23,775
but I'm okay.

135
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:30,699
Stop being so reckless.

136
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,368
Sorry.

137
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,592
Are you going, Thorfinn?

138
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:52,721
To a land on the other side of the sea?

139
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,351
It's Vinland.

140
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:02,230
Vinland...

141
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,736
At that moment,

142
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:10,530
when Arnheid

143
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,199
took her last breath,

144
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:17,120
I couldn't give an answer right away.

145
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:19,956
Why

146
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,667
do they have to live?

147
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,420
These souls

148
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,840
live through hell and seek peace in death.

149
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:33,470
What can you possibly say to them?

150
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:43,521
I want a world where we can
tell them to live.

151
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,610
A place where we can confidently
say that to people who don't have

152
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,404
any escape other than death.

153
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,951
A place that overshadows
the appeal of death.

154
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:01,998
I want that in our world.

155
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,377
That is all...

156
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:09,714
That is all we ever wanted.

157
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,238
I can't back down.

158
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,577
If it doesn't exist...

159
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,751
If it's not there, I'll make it.

160
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:52,716
Einar...

161
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:03,143
Come with me, my brother.

162
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:07,397
We're going to make
a land of peace in Vinland.

163
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:11,276
Somewhere we can proudly
tell Arnheid about.

164
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:17,115
Let's do it, my brother.
Let's go to the other side of the sea

165
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:20,618
and create a land
where there are no slaves or war.

166
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:28,460
For Arnheid.

167
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:16,591
Are you sure

168
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,968
you're okay with this?

169
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:24,349
It wasn't my place to do that anyway.

170
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,853
I'll tell the master and everyone else

171
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:32,941
that the young master
was the one who persuaded the king.

172
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:34,984
That'll be great.

173
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,322
You can leave Arnheid's grave to me.

174
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,533
I will protect it.

175
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,249
Thank you so much.

176
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:51,709
It's nothing.

177
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,132
Thorfinn, I want to become like you.

178
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:59,634
I want to become

179
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:04,514
a real man who is
strong and kind, like you.

180
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:12,230
Olmar, I heard

181
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:16,276
that you made the decision to
stop fighting.

182
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,653
That is a wonderful thing.

183
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:25,243
It took me 15 years.

184
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:30,248
But...

185
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:38,923
I finally know what I am supposed to do.

186
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:43,970
This is a wonderful farm.

187
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:47,932
Please get it back on its feet
and protect it.

188
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,104
Old master,

189
00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:55,773
thank you very much.

190
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,527
You always helped us out.

191
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:06,159
I told you,
it was just part of our contract.

192
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:09,746
There is nothing for you to thank me for.

193
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:20,548
I wish they took at least one silver mark.

194
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,727
Thorfinn! Einar!

195
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,901
My name is Roald! I am Roald, son of Grim!

196
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:49,077
Thank you, Roald!

197
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:51,537
I wish you all the best!

198
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:28,449
Come here.

199
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:43,339
Good boy.

200
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:46,467
ENGRAVE IT

201
00:21:56,561 --> 00:22:01,357
ENGRAVE IT UPON YOUR BODY
ENGRAVE IT UPON THE LAND

202
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:09,365
ENGRAVE IT UPON THE SEA

203
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:19,751
ENGRAVE IT UPON YOUR LOOT
ENGRAVE IT UPON YOUR ENEMY

204
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:22,295
ENGRAVE IT

205
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:29,052
Hey, when are you going to
start working, Boss?

206
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:31,304
- Come on!
- Oh, quit yapping.

207
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:33,931
I was just taking a break.

208
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:37,310
I'll show you how to really work a field.

209
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,437
Oh, then why don't you show us?

210
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:43,441
I'll finish this before you know it.

211
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:46,694
ENGRAVE ITS TEXTURE UPON ME

212
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,043
My life

213
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:07,340
has always been about enduring,

214
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:13,346
I thought the countless hardships
were part of living in this world.

215
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,479
Would you have guessed that

216
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:25,233
we would meet people
like those two, Arnheid?

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:31,447
They're on their way...

218
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:38,371
to a world that we can't even imagine.

219
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:46,129
To a place other than here.

220
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:56,514
ENGRAVE THAT ENCOUNTER UPON ME

221
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,033
<i>"Hometown."</i>

222
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,910
