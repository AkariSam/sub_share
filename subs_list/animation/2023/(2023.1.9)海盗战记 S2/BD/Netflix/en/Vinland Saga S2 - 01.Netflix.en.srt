1
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,890
<i>Engrave it...</i>

2
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:51,190
<i>Engrave it upon your body.</i>

3
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,616
<i>Engrave it upon the land.</i>

4
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,833
<i>Engrave it upon the sea.</i>

5
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,173
<i>Engrave it upon your enemy.</i>

6
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:18,676
<i>Engrave it upon your loot.</i>

7
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:22,763
<i>Engrave it...</i>

8
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:25,683
<i>Engrave it...</i>

9
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:45,160
<i>Engrave your warmth upon me.</i>

10
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:09,560
Einar!

11
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,357
What was that for!

12
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,359
Right back at you.

13
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:20,863
If you cut that tree
it'll crush our house.

14
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:26,368
- Are you going to become a woodcutter?
- No, I'm not.

15
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:30,122
I'm training for battle!
Take a look at my power!

16
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,000
You may be well-built,

17
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,587
but that doesn't mean you can fight.
Now get the food ready!

18
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:39,006
I'm starving!

19
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:45,221
More like, don't throw a knife at me.

20
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,806
Pick something else like plates or spoons.

21
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:49,516
It's okay if it's a plate?

22
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:57,733
So that's why bears do it.

23
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,818
- Eat a lot before winter.
- Is that so.

24
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,076
- Thanks.
- So, why did you?

25
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:08,911
Start training all of a sudden?

26
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:13,707
What else is there,
other than to protect this place.

27
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,921
Everything was reduced to ashes.

28
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,674
But we finally got back on our feet.

29
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,053
Nobody wants to go through that again.

30
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:29,807
Even Dad--

31
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,061
Guttorm's milk is delicious!

32
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:36,981
I know, right? That man knows

33
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:39,316
how to handle teats.

34
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:41,443
What's with those fingers? How creepy!

35
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:42,528
I'm talking here!

36
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,072
- Ew!
- Don't think about it.

37
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:46,782
Don't involve yourself with warriors.

38
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,746
Aren't you frustrated with
being on the losing end all the time?

39
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,000
Dad died to protect us, you know.

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,003
That's right. And that's why you're alive.

41
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,629
You rebuilt the village

42
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,215
and are eating a delicious meal
with two beauties.

43
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:09,430
We haven't lost.

44
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,398
Listen, once you enter the forest,
just run for your life.

45
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:02,316
Follow the river...

46
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:04,818
Róta...

47
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,653
Mom...

48
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,833
Don't think about anything.
Just run straight ahead.

49
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,753
Your brother and mother are with you.

50
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:00,082
Mom!

51
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,926
Ready? I'll lift you up.

52
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,722
Mom!

53
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,859
Einar, run away.

54
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:31,029
- Leave me behind.
- Don't be stupid!

55
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:34,992
Forget that! Just try to stand up!

56
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:35,993
Mom?

57
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,245
Mom!

58
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:47,296
Mom!

59
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:51,800
Stupid girl...

60
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:57,473
Hey, there are still people over there.

61
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:01,477
Oh, I see a woman too. Here we come!

62
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:15,866
Stand up, Einar.

63
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,912
Take Róta... Hurry!

64
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:22,748
Mom...

65
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,669
I may be a dying old lady...

66
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:29,713
but I can do this much.

67
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:33,217
Make it out alive...

68
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,430
As long as you're alive...

69
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,349
you can start again...

70
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,486
Einar...

71
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:55,072
Róta...

72
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,886
Why aren't they running away?

73
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:20,389
Hey, she's pretty cute.

74
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,725
Your mama died, right?

75
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,396
- Róta!
- Let go!

76
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:29,022
- Einar!
- Róta!

77
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:31,191
Let go of her!

78
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:34,152
Einar!

79
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,905
I won't forgive you! How dare you!

80
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:41,368
- Einar!
- How sad.

81
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,337
How dare you--

82
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:05,559
Hey! What are you doing?!

83
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:08,270
She stabbed me with something!

84
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:10,522
What a waste.

85
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:14,568
Oh well. Let's sell this kid
and get some drinks with that money.

86
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:17,863
- You're such an idiot!
- I'm sorry, okay?

87
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:21,199
Come on, drink money.

88
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:21,593
A FIR TREE STANDING ON BARREN LAND DIES
WITH NO BARK NOR LEAVES TO SHELTER IT

89
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,720
SO IS A MAN WHOM NO ONE LOVES

90
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,348
WHY SHOULD HE KEEP ON LIVING?
EXCERPT FROM <i>HÁVAMÁL</i>

91
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:09,349
How is she?

92
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:14,354
This is no good.

93
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:16,356
Damn it.

94
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:18,483
We have no choice. Help me carry her.

95
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,664
Ready...

96
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,334
Hey!

97
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,181
Hey! What are you doing?!

98
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,849
You didn't have to throw her out!

99
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:58,106
Good, it's not inflamed.

100
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,571
We'll pass out fur blankets.
Keep your bodies warm.

101
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:07,699
We spent a fortune on you all.

102
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,577
Don't you dare become sick
without our approval.

103
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:15,081
At least stay healthy
until we find a buyer for you. Got that?

104
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,630
Hurry up! We have to furl the sail!

105
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:50,492
That's right...

106
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,078
I have to live...

107
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:07,759
Make sure to drink alcohol.
It'll give you a healthy complexion.

108
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:11,513
Wash every nook and cranny.
Especially your hair.

109
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,391
Get rid of each other's lice.

110
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:21,606
How is that?

111
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,862
Her hair is fine.
Do her makeup so she looks younger.

112
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:44,796
How about it? We have
a pretty good lineup, don't we?

113
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:47,215
They're all so-so.

114
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:51,219
Don't say that.
We have the best of the best.

115
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,475
<i>That's right... I can't just stay there!</i>

116
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:01,813
<i>If I can get out of here alive,
I can start again...</i>

117
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:26,254
Up we go...

118
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:30,550
A thief!

119
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:32,802
Sorry!

120
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:40,685
Hey, Einar.

121
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,689
It seems like you still don't get it.

122
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:56,159
All right, you slaves. Listen carefully.

123
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,704
Your homelands are far, far away.

124
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:02,207
You can't return even if you try.

125
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:06,920
And of course,
no one will help you run away.

126
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:11,841
That's because you're foreign, penniless,

127
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:14,094
slaves!

128
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:17,847
Get someone nice to buy you
and do your best to serve them.

129
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:22,602
You'll get to eat nice meals, which you
won't if you escape and become a beggar.

130
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:26,856
Before you venture out,
think about which life is more favorable.

131
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,402
Got that, Einar?

132
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,584
I...

133
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,212
will...

134
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,007
...live!

135
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:00,682
Yeah...

136
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:03,184
He's not bad,

137
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,895
but don't you have one with a cuter face?

138
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:08,481
I see! If that's the case,

139
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:11,276
I have a special one just for you.

140
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:14,279
Is that so? How exciting.

141
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,240
I'm sure you will love it.

142
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,539
<i>They are right.</i>

143
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:26,958
<i>Even if I recklessly escape</i>

144
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,294
<i>I won't have anyone to help me.</i>

145
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:32,047
<i>Besides...</i>

146
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:36,384
<i>I don't...</i>

147
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:40,472
<i>have anywhere to go anymore.</i>

148
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,600
<i>If I just...</i>

149
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,479
<i>give in and become an obedient pet...</i>

150
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:53,276
My goodness, you sure are lucky.

151
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:55,528
We just restocked a bunch of them.

152
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:57,030
Look, that's him.

153
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,409
He's what you're looking for, right?

154
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:30,563
He's completely different!

155
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,857
He's neither blond nor small!

156
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:35,985
How weird...
Now that I take a good look, he's not.

157
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:39,072
Well, anyhow, what do you think about him?

158
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:41,491
He's strong and sturdy. If you buy now--

159
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:45,870
Like I said, I'm not here to buy a worker!

160
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:49,082
I just want to free a relative of mine.

161
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:52,752
I'm pretty sure he ended up in this town.

162
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:56,381
He's blond and small
and his name is Thorfinn.

163
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:59,259
Are you sure you have no clue where he is?

164
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,309
Sorry about that.

165
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:12,522
Sorry to waste your time.

166
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:15,525
No worries. Please come again.

167
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:19,779
He'll never find him.

168
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:27,120
<i>So he's asking around
in search of his relative, huh?</i>

169
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:33,501
<i>Whoever has someone like that
searching for him</i>

170
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:35,420
<i>is so fortunate.</i>

171
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,634
You there.

172
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,726
Can you understand me? Show me your teeth.

173
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:06,826
- What's your name?
- It's Einar.

174
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:09,120
Where are you from
and what was your profession?

175
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:12,081
I was a farmer in the north of England.

176
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:26,346
Einar, what do you think about
helping out with my field?

177
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:35,939
Field?

178
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:01,464
Einar, this way!

179
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:08,012
All of my servants are working now.

180
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:11,933
- I'll introduce you during dinnertime.
- Yes, sir.

First, take a look at my farm.

182
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,181
<i>Hey, Mom, are you sure?</i>

183
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:57,687
<i>I don't even have the freedom to choose</i>

184
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,814
<i>life or death anymore.</i>

185
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:02,900
<i>Can you still say</i>

186
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:06,321
<i>that we haven't lost?</i>

187
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:31,971
<i>My family was killed</i>

188
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:36,100
<i>and I lost everything
including my homeland.</i>

189
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,353
<i>I didn't even know</i>

190
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:42,023
<i>what I was living for.</i>

191
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:54,243
Thorfinn! It's me! Can you come out?

192
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:12,553
<i>I must be bought by a kind master</i>

193
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,932
<i>and do my very best to serve him.</i>

194
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,395
<i>As long as I stay obedient,
I won't go hungry.</i>

195
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:25,817
<i>I was starting to believe that.</i>

196
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,152
Thorfinn?

197
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:40,915
<i>In any case,</i>

198
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:48,214
<i>that was when I met Thorfinn
for the first time.</i>

199
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,116
<i>"Ketil's farm."</i>
