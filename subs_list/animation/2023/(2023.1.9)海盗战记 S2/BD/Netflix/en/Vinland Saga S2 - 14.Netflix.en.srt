1
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,051
Arnheid.

2
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:42,890
Then this must be Ketil's farm.

3
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:46,435
Who would have thought...

4
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:48,521
You guys were so close.

5
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,940
It was a walking distance of few days.

6
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:54,401
You look a bit drawn.

7
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:58,322
But you are even more

8
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,366
beautiful than before.

9
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:10,960
What? That is Arnheid's husband?

10
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,843
Is Hjalti doing well?

11
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,972
I bet he's grown a lot by now.

12
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:34,191
Gardar...

13
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:38,612
Hjalti is...

14
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,746
Come on.

15
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,583
Let's go back. The three of us.

16
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,419
To our home.

17
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:56,881
Home?

18
00:02:57,798 --> 00:03:00,092
Don't take his hand, Arnheid!

19
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,768
If you do, I'll cut you down.

20
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:27,411
- Gardar!
- Fox!

21
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:31,332
- Take Arnheid and stay behind me.
- Yes!

22
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,467
Something's off about him, Boss.

23
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:45,012
For a second it seemed like he forgot
that he was on the run.

24
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,516
Is it true that Lizard was killed?

25
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:55,940
Yes. His head was smashed.

26
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,068
I see.

27
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:04,448
He's here to take Arnheid away.

28
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:06,325
Guard her with your life.

29
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:07,451
Yes!

30
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,330
Are you Ketil?

31
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,585
What if I am?

32
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:20,464
I'll kill you!

33
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:23,467
Stop it, Gardar! This is insane!

34
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,469
Gardar!

35
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,688
Stop, Einar!

36
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,065
You don't know the whole story.
What are you thinking?

37
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,734
Are you going to attack Snake?

38
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:42,987
I know the story!

39
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,865
Arnheid's husband has come to save her.

40
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,619
Don't you want Arnheid to be free?

41
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:53,580
I do! But look at the situation.

42
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,000
He has to take down
three people to get away.

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,461
I know that I'm not
strong enough to do anything. But still!

44
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:03,132
Einar! That's not what I'm trying to say.

45
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:06,093
Are you capable of killing someone?

46
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,387
It doesn't matter if it's a guest or not.

47
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,307
Can you really kill someone with this axe?

48
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,522
But...

49
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:22,401
Then what am I supposed to do?

50
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,780
That's a wise choice, Thorfinn.

51
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:30,284
Stay there and watch quietly.

52
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,787
I'll catch him alive.

53
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:37,291
We have to question him
and confirm his identity.

54
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:49,011
Watch out, Boss! He's strong!

55
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:51,263
Who do you think...

56
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:54,725
you're talking to? You idiot!

57
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:06,278
He's not someone you can capture alive.
Just kill him!

58
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,905
Shut up!

59
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:10,824
That was just a light warmup.

60
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:14,703
More like, were you guys able
to strike him at least once?

61
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:18,457
Huh? Oh, unfortunately...

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,211
<i>He's injured.</i>

63
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:26,006
<i>How could the three of you
lose to one wounded man.</i>

64
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,772
Just as I thought. That's the spot.

65
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:51,615
Badger, tie him up.

66
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:55,244
- Gardar!
- Amazing! He got him in no time!

67
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:59,248
Gardar!

68
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,671
Arnheid!

69
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:10,259
Arnheid!

70
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,681
Arnheid!

71
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,477
- Arnheid!
- Walk!

72
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,106
Don't let your guard down.

73
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:27,568
Always have five people watching him.

74
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:30,028
Also, go and tell Kjallakr's uncle

75
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:32,698
that we caught a suspect.

76
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:34,324
Roger.

77
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:41,248
Well then...

78
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:44,501
You look like you have something to say.

79
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,379
But a slave has no say in the matter.

80
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,635
Can't you let him go?

81
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:56,138
This is too cruel.

82
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:58,849
He killed one of my men.

83
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:01,018
He's suspected of
having killed others too.

84
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,481
On top of that,
he wants to kill the master

85
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:08,901
and steal Arnheid,
who is the master's favorite.

86
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:13,739
There's no way I can let
someone like that go.

87
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:26,418
Forget about him, Arnheid.

88
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,171
That wasn't your husband.

89
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:32,674
It was just a crazy runaway slave.

90
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:40,766
Listen, don't get involved in this matter.

91
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:43,227
Take care of Gramps for me.

92
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:28,230
- Wait, Einar.
- Einar...

93
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,987
Please stay seated.

94
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:40,242
Dinner is almost ready.

95
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,539
If it's at night...

96
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:49,418
While it's still dark, we might be able to

97
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:51,962
sneak inside the fort and rescue Gardar.

98
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:54,548
If we don't do anything,

99
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:57,301
your husband will be executed for sure.

100
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:01,388
I appreciate it.

101
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:03,223
But it's fine.

102
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:06,184
Some things are out of our control.

103
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:12,482
When things like that happen,
it's best to do nothing.

104
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,986
You stay still

105
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:18,405
and wait for the storm to pass.

106
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:23,910
Einar, don't let yourself
be caught up in the storm.

107
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:29,750
Do you not

108
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,878
like Gardar?

109
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,172
I do.

110
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:39,509
Our marriage was arranged by our parents,

111
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,637
but he was kind

112
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,722
to me and our son.

113
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,225
Well then, let's go!

114
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:49,728
Even if it means fighting with Snake,

115
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,521
it's better than doing nothing.

116
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,066
Isn't that right, Thorfinn?

117
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:00,530
Please, Thorfinn. Lend us your help.

118
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,783
I'll distract the guards so you--

119
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,992
I...

120
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,496
lost my son over a pot.

121
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:19,424
Will you let me talk
a little about myself?

122
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,020
About my past...

123
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,924
<i>Our family</i>

124
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:04,428
<i>lived in a certain village in Sweden.</i>

125
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:08,557
<i>We were neither wealthy nor poor,</i>

126
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:10,142
<i>but it was peaceful.</i>

127
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,318
<i>Around the time our son was one,</i>

128
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:24,489
<i>a swamp that produced iron was
discovered deep within a faraway forest.</i>

129
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,868
<i>It led to a conflict between</i>

130
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:30,620
<i>several groups who wanted</i>

131
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,581
<i>rights to the swamp.</i>

132
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:36,334
<i>Among those involved in the conflict</i>

133
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:37,836
<i>was Gardar's friend,</i>

134
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:41,381
<i>and he came to ask for his help.</i>

135
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:47,262
<i>Gardar told everyone
in the village about it</i>

136
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,848
<i>and the men discussed the topic</i>

137
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:54,269
<i>of whether to join the fight or not.</i>

138
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,355
<i>If we win, we get iron.</i>

139
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,572
<i>The conclusion the men came up with was</i>

140
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:07,449
<i>to join.</i>

141
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:19,628
When the women heard about it,
we were shocked.

142
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:21,963
After all, our village was not

143
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:26,051
in need of pots or blades for our sickles.

144
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,722
Despite that,

145
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,641
there was no way for women

146
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,560
to overturn a decision made by men.

147
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,982
Please reconsider, Gardar.

148
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:44,569
It's not like we're struggling
because we don't have iron.

149
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:52,244
Why are you risking your life
for something we don't even need?

150
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:54,329
Arnheid...

151
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,750
We do need it.

152
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:03,880
Yngve of the west is a very ambitious man.

153
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:07,634
If his family gets a hold of the iron,

154
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:10,637
the balance of power
in this area will fall apart.

155
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:16,601
Plus, our village will become prosperous.

156
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,646
That includes both of you too.

157
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,867
Hjalti!

158
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:35,745
Your father is going to fight
to protect you.

159
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:39,791
<i>I couldn't understand.</i>

160
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,710
Hey! Ouch!

161
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:45,171
<i>If he wanted to protect us,</i>

162
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:48,091
<i>all he needed to do was stay by our side.</i>

163
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,227
All of the young men went to war

164
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:02,272
and the women and children left behind
protected the homes.

165
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:04,441
A few weeks went by like that.

166
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:07,944
<i>Then...</i>

167
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:14,951
Look...

168
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:18,455
<i>When we saw the boats,</i>

169
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:21,791
<i>we thought the men had returned.</i>

170
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:27,422
<i>But they were...</i>

171
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:42,395
<i>They targeted us
knowing that all the men were gone.</i>

172
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,943
They burned our houses
and killed the elderly.

173
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:51,237
The women were put inside boats

174
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,490
and taken away.

175
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,242
I...

176
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,621
Hjalti was...

177
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,674
Hjalti!

178
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:16,596
Stop! No! Hjalti!

179
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:33,363
Today, when I saw Gardar,

180
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,574
I felt terrified of him.

181
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:40,120
<i>All of the pain he has suffered</i>

182
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,455
<i>must have changed him.</i>

183
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:46,001
<i>Now, he himself</i>

184
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,086
<i>is the storm.</i>

185
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,174
This time...

186
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:55,135
This time

187
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:56,970
I will make sure to protect

188
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,514
my child from the storm created by men.

189
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,477
Child?

190
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,941
I found out just the other day.

191
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:16,489
Right now,
I am carrying Master Ketil's child.

192
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:25,165
I'm sure this child
will be welcomed by the master.

193
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,877
He was longing for a child, after all.

194
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:31,963
As long as I'm on this farm,

195
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,841
I will be able to peacefully

196
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:37,385
raise a healthy child.

197
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:43,850
So, Einar...

198
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:46,102
Let things be

199
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:49,272
until the storm passes.

200
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:53,276
Let things be...

201
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:54,337
I thought you were

202
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:57,715
going to wait for the storm to pass,

203
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:59,634
Arnheid.

204
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:04,681
You were listening, Old Master?

205
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:11,479
You guys seem to think
I've gone completely senile,

206
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:15,900
but my mind is still working fine.
Don't underestimate me.

207
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:24,826
I just want to
care for his wounds, that's all.

208
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,375
I know

209
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,712
that I shouldn't see him anymore.

210
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:40,550
And yet, I don't know why...

211
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,266
There was a time

212
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:52,812
when I also waited patiently
for a storm to pass.

213
00:19:56,024 --> 00:20:00,153
Actually, I was just hiding.

214
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:02,864
While trembling...

215
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:20,131
This was more than 20 years ago.

216
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:26,804
<i>At the time, my son Ketil</i>

217
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:31,017
<i>and a beautiful girl from the same town
had fallen in love with each other.</i>

218
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,897
<i>But one day,</i>

219
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:39,609
<i>that girl caught the eye of Ebbe,
a man who was</i>

220
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:43,321
<i>gradually increasing his influence
in the surrounding area.</i>

221
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:47,325
<i>We were forced to make
a difficult decision.</i>

222
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:51,162
<i>Ketil was ready to take up arms</i>

223
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:54,332
<i>in order to protect the girl.</i>

224
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,629
<i>But at the time,
we weren't as powerful as we are now</i>

225
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:03,716
<i>and many feared Ebbe.</i>

226
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:07,595
<i>They thought we would be destroyed
if we went against his wishes.</i>

227
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:12,850
<i>In the end, we decided</i>

228
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,436
<i>to obey.</i>

229
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:21,985
How can I call myself a Nordic man...?

230
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:24,821
I offered up a girl

231
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:28,157
just to save my own skin.

232
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,080
<i>Then...</i>

233
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,709
<i>on the girl's wedding day...</i>

234
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:54,976
<i>It was the act of</i>

235
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:58,938
<i>a man who loathed Ebbe
and envied his wealth.</i>

236
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:07,030
<i>By the time we heard the news
and rushed over there,</i>

237
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,908
<i>everything had been burned down already.</i>

238
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,005
Why...?

239
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:28,718
Why do these things always happen?

240
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:37,435
All I can say is that...

241
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:45,651
<i>you may be able to let the storm pass</i>

242
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:49,781
<i>but it will still leave you with scars.</i>

243
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:08,674
I'm sorry I can't be of any help.

244
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:26,067
I will be right back.

245
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:38,950
<i>"Storm."</i>

246
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,951
