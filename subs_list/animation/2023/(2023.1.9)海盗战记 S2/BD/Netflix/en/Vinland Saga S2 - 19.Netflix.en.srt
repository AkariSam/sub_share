1
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:07,002
We're with you!

2
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,379
Let's go!

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:11,007
There are about 350 people.

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:15,302
Out of which only about 100
actually know how to fight.

5
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:18,723
Get an exact number later on.

6
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:24,145
Are we seriously going to do this, Boss?

7
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:28,274
The master is bent on doing it.

8
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:29,984
We have no choice.

9
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:35,364
They must be insane.

10
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:40,578
Do these guys think they have a chance
against the king's army?

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,957
All of them owe the master money.

12
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:49,712
He assembled them by saying that
he'll write it off if they fight.

13
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:54,592
Even still, they wouldn't have come
if they knew their enemy was the king.

14
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:56,635
But now that they're here,
they can't turn back

15
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:59,388
because their pride
as a Nordic man won't allow that.

16
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:03,934
And plus, people feel
invincible in big numbers.

17
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:06,687
It makes you feel like you can win.

18
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:10,441
It was a smart tactic
to wait until everyone assembled

19
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,359
before saying our enemy is the king.

20
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:19,992
I didn't know Thorgil was this battlewise.

21
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:44,016
<i>The master is determined to do it.
He's already got an army.</i>

22
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:48,312
This place is going to
become a battlefield.

23
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,901
I told you, didn't I?
We have to leave this farm now

24
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,403
or we'll get caught up in it, Thorfinn.

25
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:59,907
I know, but...

26
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,335
Leif,

27
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:17,508
we cannot leave Arnheid like this

28
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,927
and escape from the farm.

29
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:25,474
Thank you so much

30
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,727
for caring about someone like me.

31
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,149
You've changed, Thorfinn.

32
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:38,737
At first, when I saw you,
I thought you were the wrong person.

33
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:46,036
You look much better now, Thorfinn.

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,379
I finally got to see you again.
I can't just

35
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,841
leave you and escape on my own.

36
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:03,053
Pater, there it is again!

37
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:04,805
Turn her to the side.

38
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:07,474
We can't let her choke on
whatever she's coughing up.

39
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:09,977
Pater,

40
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:13,731
is it possible to relocate Arnheid?

41
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:18,319
No, I think we should
be careful right now.

42
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:22,990
Once she wakes up,
I can see how she's doing,

43
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,909
but at the moment

44
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:29,288
I honestly can't determine her condition.

45
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:33,417
And plus, I'm worried about her baby.

46
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:36,712
The best thing we can do is let her rest.

47
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,132
At least until she regains consciousness.

48
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:44,261
One day...

49
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:48,265
Let's wait for just one day
and see how it goes.

50
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,101
Are you serious?

51
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,896
What are you going to do after that?

52
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:04,865
Boss, hurry!

53
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,118
- Are they here?
- Yes.

54
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,829
Where I'm pointing.

55
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:17,753
That was faster than I expected.

56
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:22,925
Send a message to the master!
We spot a fleet in the north.

57
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,304
The king's army is here.

58
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,569
- They're here.
- That's them.

59
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,905
- What should we do?
- First...

60
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:17,623
You idiot! Don't shoot without permission!

61
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,584
Obviously it won't reach at this distance!

62
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:23,462
Lure them in more and then at once--

63
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,104
Damn it! Go back!

64
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,022
Darn it!

65
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:45,109
How are they reaching all the way here?

66
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:57,621
Spread out and gain control over the area.

67
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,915
Make way for His Majesty The King.

68
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:14,763
It seems as though
Ketil wants to fight me.

69
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:18,016
Dispatch an envoy, Wulf.

70
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:21,979
We will line up here
and wait for Ketil's response.

71
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,063
Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:32,239
This is a nice piece of land.
It's a waste to stain it with blood.

73
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:45,335
Based on the aforementioned reasons,
King Canute

74
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:48,338
has ordered to have
the rebellious Ketil and his family

75
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:52,801
be outlawed for ten years
from this day forward.

76
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:57,347
Under normal circumstances,
these crimes are worthy of death,

77
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:00,517
but the lives
of Ketil and his family are spared

78
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:04,521
as a result of the mercy
of none other than His Majesty.

79
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,024
Humbly accept your punishment.

80
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,195
That is all.

81
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:14,573
If you don't want to die,
hurry up and flee to another country.

82
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,451
We will wait until tomorrow morning
for your answer.

83
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,002
You're useless!

84
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,213
How could you let them on shore so easily!

85
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:34,218
Rebellion? Outlawry?

86
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:37,846
Don't get cocky with me, you brat!

87
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,724
I'm back.

88
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,729
Thorgil! How was Canute's army?

89
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,359
They were boiling their pots
and leisurely eating lunch.

90
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,321
<i>There are two warships
and two cargo ships.</i>

91
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,241
<i>And they've pitched tents
right by the landing place.</i>

92
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:00,369
<i>They have approximately 100 men.</i>

93
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:04,122
One hundred?

94
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:07,376
Yeah, excluding the slaves and servants.

95
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,675
- What a joke.
- Did you hear that?

96
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:18,512
That is less than a third of our army.

97
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:22,849
That darn Canute...
Did he think that we would

98
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:26,728
bow down in fear
once we saw the king himself?

99
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:31,858
This land is home to countless daredevils
who aren't afraid of the king!

100
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,945
Let's go, all of you!

101
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:39,366
Whoever beheads the king
will receive a prize of their choice!

102
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,784
Yeah!

103
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:43,328
Yes!

104
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:45,664
What a happy bunch.

105
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,793
These 100 men aren't ordinary warriors.

106
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:54,214
The ones surrounding the large tent...

107
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,800
Those are the king's thegns.

108
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,263
Th... The king is seriously here?

109
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:05,309
We're talking about the royal guard here.

110
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,228
They're a group
of the strongest warriors in Denmark.

111
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:11,148
And they're Thorgil's former
brothers-in-arms.

112
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:15,444
S... So you mean...

113
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:19,573
all of them are as strong as Thorgil?

114
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:24,578
So what about the other guys
in white capes?

115
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:27,122
Are they weaker
compared to the royal guard?

116
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:30,417
What? You've never seen them before?

117
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,838
They are the Jomsvikings.

118
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:42,387
I've never seen your eyes open so wide.

119
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,810
We can't win.

120
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:55,359
They're on another level compared to
our hodgepodge of farmers and warriors.

121
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:58,528
They're the kind of people
who only think about war,

122
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,447
from morning to night.

123
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:05,827
But it seems like the master needs to
fight them once to understand that.

124
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,457
If you want to run away, go ahead.

125
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:13,543
King Canute is giving us time to escape.

126
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:17,631
What are you going to do, Boss?

127
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:21,510
I'm a commander. How could I run away?

128
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,764
I'll try my best to protect
as many as I can

129
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:29,101
of those 350 overconfident dummies.

130
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,645
Well then,

131
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:36,233
why don't we tie up the Ketil family
and hand them over?

132
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:39,277
That's right!
Then we won't have to go to war.

133
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,280
We're going to tie up Thorgil too?

134
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,368
Don't be a chicken!
If eight of us go, we can manage.

135
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:49,037
No, it's not just Thorgil.

136
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:52,457
There's the rumored "Iron Fist Ketil."

137
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:55,669
You know the story about
how he killed a bear with his bare hands.

138
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:02,592
Come on, let's just run away, Boss!

139
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:05,971
Nothing good is going to come
from being stubborn.

140
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,642
"Iron Fist," huh?

141
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:15,272
I know Iron Fist very well.

142
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:19,693
<i>I met him when I was about 15 or 16.</i>

143
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:23,155
<i>He showed me the ropes on the battlefield.</i>

144
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:26,408
<i>He really was incredibly strong.</i>

145
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:31,329
He's like an older brother to me.

146
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:37,586
I forget how many years ago it was,
but I got into a little trouble

147
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:40,213
and I became a fugitive.

148
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:44,426
<i>I thought my big brother, Ketil,
would be willing to take me in,</i>

149
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:49,055
<i>so I followed the rumors
and fled to this farm.</i>

150
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,476
<i>However,</i>

151
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:55,645
<i>when I finally arrived here...</i>

152
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,816
Who are you? Do you have business with me?

153
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:04,905
<i>It was a completely different person,
believe it or not.</i>

154
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:06,698
Huh?

155
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,910
What?

156
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,578
What in the world!

157
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:15,207
The master is deceiving everyone.

158
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:18,335
Just because they happened to have
the same name.

159
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:21,421
I'm speechless.

160
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:24,216
How did no one find out until now?

161
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,345
But it's not like I had
anywhere else to go.

162
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:31,973
So I ended up working here as a guard dog.

163
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:36,520
They've fed me for free
for quite some time.

164
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:41,608
It's about time
I pay them back for the food.

165
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,205
Well, you guys can do whatever you like.

166
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,166
Now you know the master is a fraud

167
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,585
who isn't worth risking your life for.

168
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:06,049
Well then, take care.

169
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:29,406
Don't try to act cool, you idiots.

170
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:32,826
You guys will die before you get to
pay back for your meals.

171
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,161
Sh... Shut up!

172
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:38,665
If we dine and dash
against a fraud like him,

173
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:42,711
that will make us
the real scum of the earth.

174
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:45,714
We will work and pay for our food!

175
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:52,929
<i>Don't go blabbering
about what I just told you.</i>

176
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,753
Their backs are against the ocean.

177
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:28,173
The king's army is positioned
in two lines here.

178
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:31,509
This circle is King Canute.

179
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,888
They've docked their ships on the sand

180
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:37,182
and are not thinking about
what's behind them.

181
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:42,312
They know that we don't have
a sufficient army.

182
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:48,860
The terrain is wide open
so we can't launch a surprise attack.

183
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,947
Olmar, how would you attack them?

184
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,865
Huh?

185
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:56,326
A night attack?

186
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,619
Wrong.

187
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:01,039
Night attacks are done by
first-rate warriors.

188
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,833
It's impossible for amateurs.

189
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,630
<i>Those guys won't be of any help.</i>

190
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,091
<i>By the time you count to 100
they'll all be killed.</i>

191
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:12,884
What?

192
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:16,805
Then why did you assemble them?

193
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:20,475
You amateur.

194
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:23,144
There's only one reason.

195
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:26,815
So they can distract the king

196
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:30,026
while we count to 100.

197
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,086
Thorgil! Where are you, Thorgil?

198
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:51,923
Jeez, where is he when I need him?

199
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:55,468
Master, the entire army is ready.

200
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:59,305
All right. On my order, get ready to fire.

201
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:01,808
Get ready!

202
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:07,188
Master, this is the final warning.

203
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:10,275
If we do this, we'll lose.

204
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,028
That's enough, Snake.

205
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,530
I am the Iron Fist Ketil.

206
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,117
Nothing about me is inferior to that brat.

207
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,749
Fire!

208
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,182
It's begun.

209
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:48,772
The best of luck, Pater.

210
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,275
Damn it!

211
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:59,032
It's all right. Let's go.

212
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,993
Both armies are in the middle of fighting.

213
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,539
Slowly! Try to keep it stable.

214
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:16,007
I'm not going to be responsible for this...

215
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,884
This is stealing, isn't it?

216
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:20,136
Stealing a slave...

217
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:22,055
Don't worry about it.

218
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:24,307
I left a reasonable amount of money.

219
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,770
I didn't know you had it in you, Dad.

220
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:32,607
She's Thorfinn's friend.
I can't leave her behind.

221
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:35,985
If she stays here, she will be killed.

222
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:44,077
We couldn't

223
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:46,913
say goodbye to the old master.

224
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:24,742
Did the children fall asleep?

225
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:30,665
Yes.

226
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,546
They fall asleep so quickly
when they're swayed by the wagon.

227
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:46,431
Are you scared?

228
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,726
Don't worry.

229
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:52,770
We'll get out of this dark forest soon.

230
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:59,110
This place is a pool of pain and despair.

231
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:02,530
It's a forest with bloodthirsty beasts.

232
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:06,201
It's not the place to raise a life.

233
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:13,499
We have a warm home waiting for us.

234
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:18,796
It was a long, painful journey, wasn't it?

235
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,592
But that pain will soon end.

236
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:26,095
Yes.

237
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:30,058
I guess you're right.

238
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:46,741
But even then,

239
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:50,536
there are still...

240
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:57,293
beings who try to survive out here.

241
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,467
Gardar?

242
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,179
Go ahead

243
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,309
and say goodbye to those
who took care of you.

244
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:22,860
I'll be waiting here with the children.

245
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:29,784
You're right.

246
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:35,039
I have to say thank you
to Einar and everybody.

247
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:43,506
Stop! Stop!

248
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,719
It's me! Can you comprehend?

249
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,845
How do you feel?

250
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,892
Einar...

251
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:07,947
Advance 50 steps! Be thorough.

252
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:10,491
Show them the difference in power.

253
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:25,757
As expected of the Jomsvikings.

254
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:28,634
They only have one line of 70 men,

255
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:30,386
but they're not faltering at all.

256
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:33,723
At this point, we don't need a rear guard.

257
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:37,101
Send the thegns in the second row
to arrest Ketil.

258
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,019
Yes, Your Majesty.

259
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,522
Don't retreat! Charge!

260
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:44,442
Show them your determination!

261
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:47,236
Damn it!

262
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:50,490
Where did my sons go?

263
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:07,924
It's impossible

264
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:11,552
to swim while carrying a sword.

265
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,186
It's impossible, brother.

266
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:23,481
I can't

267
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:27,443
become like you.

268
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:55,513
You'll never see me coming, King Canute!

269
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,033
<i>"Pain."</i>

270
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,451
