1
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:16,298
This is ridiculous!

2
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,554
Einar! Wait, Einar.

3
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,307
Let's dig deeper and cut the roots.

4
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:27,768
It won't come out like this.

5
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:34,942
Damn you...

6
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:36,944
It still won't budge.

7
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:48,706
Darn it!

8
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:00,175
A horse...

9
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:03,387
It's impossible
without a horse, after all.

10
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:07,474
They let us borrow one
to transport the timber,

11
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:10,269
so why don't we get a horse
for grading the land?

12
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,187
It makes no sense.

13
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:14,773
That horse wasn't lent to us.

14
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:18,444
We were just forced to do
the work meant for the farmhands.

15
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:21,864
What should we do, Einar?

16
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:25,201
Should we hold off on making a field
and just cut the trees?

17
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:31,332
No, I'll ask them one more time.

18
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,459
Although it may be pointless.

19
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:37,129
You don't know when to give up, do you?

20
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,632
No means no!

21
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:43,469
Yeah, but we got permission from Pater.

22
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,180
Pater?

23
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,848
Darn that ex-slave...

24
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:49,600
Anyway, it's a no.

25
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,228
We're using all the horses for other jobs.

26
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:54,313
We don't have enough to lend to you.

27
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,653
It's no use, slaves.

28
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:03,364
Stop skipping work
and go back to the forest.

29
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:04,907
Hello.

30
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:10,037
Oh? I only heard one greeting.

31
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:13,415
The big one doesn't have
any manners, as usual.

32
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,710
Hey, I'm going to borrow a horse.

33
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,711
Okay.

34
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:22,758
First of all,

35
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:26,595
you slaves are no different from
cows and horses.

36
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:29,473
The fact that a horse like you

37
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:33,269
is leasing land and managing a field
is annoying in itself.

38
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,565
Use your own bodies!

39
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,989
At this rate,

40
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,324
we have to ask the master himself.

41
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:49,201
We need a horse no matter what.

42
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:52,162
Not just for the tree stumps,
but to plow as well.

43
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,958
I'm not going to
let their bullying stop me!

44
00:04:56,917 --> 00:05:01,255
But even if we're able to borrow a horse
with the masters help,

45
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,549
it will upset the farmhands.

46
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:05,968
We'll be targeted even more.

47
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:10,222
Then what will we do?
Do everything by manpower?

48
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:14,268
Who knows how many years
it will take to prepare the field.

49
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,854
The forest is still huge.

50
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:20,607
Maybe we can clear up more land
before we start on the field?

51
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,527
Growing crops simultaneously
would be impossible.

52
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:29,491
Thorfinn!

53
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:33,078
Why are you so unmotivated?

54
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:34,747
Don't you want freedom?

55
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:38,042
Even if it's impossible,
we have to grow crops!

56
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:41,920
Then we'll sell them to the master
and buy our freedom.

57
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,758
To do that we need a horse!

58
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:50,512
Einar, you are so energetic for someone

59
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:52,431
who doesn't get decent meals.

60
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:53,515
Stupid!

61
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:55,934
Your lack of energy is more abnormal.

62
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:59,438
- I got the gist of it.
- Huh?

63
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:07,946
Up we go... Ouch...

64
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:18,457
What are you doing? Come over here.

65
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,376
We can't talk if you're so far away.

66
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,089
Don't step on the ridges.

67
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:36,016
Hello. Um, what can we do for you?

68
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:38,685
- What's your name?
- Oh yes...

69
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:41,230
- I'm Einar.
- I'm Thorfinn.

70
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,816
- Want to borrow one?
- Huh?

71
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:47,361
A horse. You need one, right?

72
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:50,781
- What?
- What?

73
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,159
Yes! We need one!

74
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,203
No way! Are you serious?

75
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:00,582
That would be so helpful! Wow!

76
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,751
More like...

77
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:05,629
Sorry, um...

78
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,673
Who are you?

79
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,772
This hurts your back.

80
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:35,284
Um, grandpa?

81
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,619
Call me Sverkel.

82
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,538
Don't forget to add a "Mr."

83
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,124
Mr. Sverkel,

84
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:44,668
for how long should we pick these rocks?

85
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:47,421
Until there are no rocks.

86
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:50,090
Hey, your hands aren't moving.

87
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,508
Oh, sorry.

88
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,346
Ouch...

89
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:58,015
Good.

90
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:01,435
So, Mr. Sverkel,

91
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:05,147
about the horse you are going to lend us...

92
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,773
Bring the basket.

93
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,284
Once you're done chopping the firewood,
go draw some water.

94
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:19,912
- Hurry now.
- Yes!

95
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,794
He's totally taking advantage of us.

96
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,880
We don't have time for this.

97
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,467
More like, I wonder if that old man

98
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,385
is living in this house alone?

99
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:41,058
I don't know.
I've never met him before either.

100
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,478
Will he really lend it to us?

101
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:49,191
What if he's just using us
and making us work for free?

102
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,778
Even if that's true, that's normal.

103
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,781
We're slaves, after all.

104
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:58,116
But we belong to the master.

105
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:01,662
I don't care about your status.

106
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,997
This is a contract.

107
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:07,918
I will lend you a horse and in exchange
you will do my chores

108
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:11,672
both when you borrow it
and when you bring it back.

109
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,007
Got that?

110
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:27,062
All right! Onto the next one!

111
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:29,565
There we go!

112
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:33,819
This is so easy! Very nice!

113
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,947
I can't believe he actually lent us one.

114
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,824
That old man is such a nice person!

115
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:47,082
There!

116
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,844
You can do it! That's it!

117
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,304
You're so cute!

118
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,725
All right!

119
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:06,893
Next one!

120
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:45,140
If we keep this up,

121
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,185
we may actually be able to sow in fall.

122
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:54,232
I wonder if that old man
would lend us a plow too?

123
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:57,361
Preferably a heavy one with wheels.

124
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:00,155
What seeds do you sow in fall?

125
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:01,490
Huh?

126
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,243
Wheat, of course.

127
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,664
Interesting. Wheat is sown in fall, huh?

128
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,379
What... Wait a second!

129
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:18,131
Have you worked in a field before?

130
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:19,174
No.

131
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,762
In my country, no one had fields.

132
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:27,391
And I was working on the battlefield
since I was a kid.

133
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,727
A country with no fields...

134
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,855
Man, it's hard to believe.

135
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:42,030
My mom and little sister
would be baffled if they heard that.

136
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,036
Well, anyway!

137
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:50,247
When it comes to the fields, count on me!

138
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:53,667
- After all, I'm a professional!
- Okay.

139
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:56,086
Hey, you slaves!

140
00:11:56,753 --> 00:12:00,590
Who gave you permission
to take that horse, huh?

141
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:04,594
- Here comes the jerk.
- Hello.

142
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,266
We didn't take this without permission.

143
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,226
Mr. Sverkel lent it to us.

144
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:13,728
Huh? Who?

145
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,856
I said Mr. Sverkel.

146
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:18,108
His place is all the way down this path.

147
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,776
Stop lying!

148
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:22,821
There's nobody named Sverkel here.

149
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:26,199
So you resorted to stealing, huh?

150
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,328
Oh? Did we have
a horse like this on our farm?

151
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:33,081
Hey, who did you say
you borrowed this horse from?

152
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:36,293
Like I said...

153
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:40,046
Mr. Sverkel! You don't know him?

154
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:42,549
He's a bald, short old man.

155
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:47,345
Bald, short, old man?

156
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:50,223
Is it the old master?

157
00:12:50,223 --> 00:12:53,685
Oh, now that you mention it,
his name was something like that.

158
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:56,563
The old master?

159
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:58,940
You must be lying after all.

160
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:02,319
He's such a grumpy man.

161
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:04,613
He would never lend you a horse.

162
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:09,117
<i>He's Master Ketil's father.</i>

163
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,413
<i>He's the most
important person on this farm.</i>

164
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:27,385
Looks like it's going to rain.

165
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:32,140
Thorfinn, after we're done with this row,
let's call it a day.

166
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:33,892
Okay.

167
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,274
It's a root again.

168
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:42,734
We removed the stumps,

169
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:45,153
but there are still roots
deep underground.

170
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:49,449
Oh well...

171
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:51,618
This year we'll only plow a thin layer.

172
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:54,913
I don't want to take a chance
and break the plow we're borrowing.

173
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:01,962
Wow...

174
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,215
That wilderness turned into
this in just one day.

175
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,304
Look, over there,

176
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,515
over there,

177
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,977
and there. They're using two.

178
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:19,604
They bought four more this year,

179
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:22,274
so there are a total of ten heavy plows.

180
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:25,485
The master must be extremely wealthy.

181
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:28,446
Are these that expensive?

182
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:30,240
They sure are!

183
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,493
In my village,
one was shared by eight families.

184
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,539
I'm so glad the old master
had one at his house.

185
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,251
There is no way the farmhands
would let us borrow one.

186
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,589
I imagine it's difficult to
cultivate the land by hand

187
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:46,882
using a hoe.

188
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:48,633
Of course it is.

189
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:51,761
Having this and a horse
makes a world of difference.

190
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:55,640
What an amazing invention.

191
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,768
This must have been invented by a farmer.

192
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:02,522
You must know the hardships of farming
in order to make

193
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:03,982
something like this.

194
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:08,904
You really are a newbie
at farming, aren't you?

195
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,573
Everything is a new discovery for you.

196
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:14,242
You're like a big baby.

197
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:23,126
It's starting to rain!

198
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:24,586
Let's hurry, Thorfinn!

199
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:33,345
Are you prepared for the rain?

200
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:36,264
Don't change the subject.

201
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:39,100
I'm worried about your health, Dad.

202
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,479
You're too old to be overworking yourself.

203
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,731
When you collapsed on the field last time,

204
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:47,567
you were lucky
that Snake happened to be there.

205
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,738
If I can die on the field,
I will have no complaints.

206
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:56,159
First of all, it's reckless
for you to live on your own at that age.

207
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,994
You can't do physical labor.

208
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:01,373
You don't need to worry about that.
I am managing.

209
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,375
Dad, don't be difficult.

210
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:06,461
Ketil,

211
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:09,381
you and I don't think the same way.

212
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:12,634
If we are together,
we'll start fighting again.

213
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,386
You're just stubborn!

214
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:18,306
This is kind of awkward.

215
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:24,938
About what we talked about...
Give it some thought.

216
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:28,942
Hm? What are you two doing here?

217
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:30,819
Hello.

218
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:34,322
Dad, don't just use them as you please.

219
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:36,366
They're my slaves.

220
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:49,462
You're wet.

221
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:52,465
Might as well
wash your clothes while you're here.

222
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:57,303
I guess those two don't get along.

223
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,182
All right, where's the washpot...

224
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:04,602
- Whoa!
- What's wrong?

225
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:08,064
- Snake! It's Snake!
- A snake?

226
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:15,030
- Why is he here?
- Uh...

227
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,616
More like, he was dead asleep
through that fight?

228
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,161
He must have thick skin.

229
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,204
What a messy sleeper.

230
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:33,173
Gramps, you're making food, aren't you!

231
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:38,344
- Don't think you can eat without me!
- Darn. You woke up.

232
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,974
Why are you two here?
Were you trying to sneak into bed with me?

233
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,935
Good morning.

234
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,355
You are hopeless...

235
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,734
You only wake up when it's mealtime.

236
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,570
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

237
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,489
How could a grown man like you

238
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:00,742
shamelessly eat a meal
without doing any work.

239
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,202
That's nonsense, Gramps.

240
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:05,747
Thieves come at night.

241
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:08,041
Peace is maintained on the farm

242
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,585
because we patrol every night.

243
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:12,337
And so I will eat.

244
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:17,175
You just hang out with girls
in their houses. How is that "guard duty"?

245
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:20,970
I'm on guard to make sure
the girls aren't taken by thieves.

246
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:23,973
You always have a cheeky comeback.

247
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,893
You always have something to nag about.

248
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:33,274
What are you guys doing?
Come over here and eat.

249
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:34,317
Aren't you hungry?

250
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:39,072
Is it okay?

251
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:42,450
Eat up! You don't have to feel bad,
it's nothing special.

252
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,576
It's not for you to say!

253
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:48,832
Sit down. People who work deserve to eat.

254
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:56,840
Um, is it true that thieves come here?

255
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:59,801
Yes, they come all the time.

256
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:03,721
They target the wheat that's ready
for harvesting and pigs.

257
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:04,973
I see...

258
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:07,934
Some of them are armed.

259
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,395
Beating them up and detaining them

260
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:11,896
is part of our job.

261
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:15,108
We are actually working, you see.

262
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:19,654
The amount we would potentially lose
to thieves is basically the same amount

263
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,698
it costs to feed you guys.

264
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,408
Old man...

265
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:25,368
Must you be so annoying?

266
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:29,622
We can chase away thieves
without your help.

267
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,375
We are Nordic men.

268
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,378
We know how to use a sword and spear.

269
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:39,257
Really? You can have
a swordfight at your age?

270
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:41,843
Don't flatter yourself, Snake.

271
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:45,180
There are countless people
who are more skilled than you.

272
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,266
I'm just worried about you
because you're old.

273
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:51,936
I'm not frail enough
to need you to worry about me.

274
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:55,523
Don't get so worked up.
You'll collapse again, Grandpa.

275
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:59,402
Say what you will, but the truth is

276
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:03,198
that the force on this farm
doesn't match up to its size.

277
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:05,074
I have 13 subordinates

278
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:06,910
and our hands are full with thieves.

279
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:11,080
<i>Let's say, 50 to 60 soldiers attack us,</i>

280
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,416
<i>this farm won't stand a chance.</i>

281
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,169
- Right, Thorfinn?
- Huh?

282
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,675
Right... Well, I wouldn't know.

283
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:28,723
We won't have to face anything worse

284
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:30,433
than thieves here.

285
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,727
You never know!

286
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:35,313
When that happens,
it'll be too late to panic.

287
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:36,564
Don't worry.

288
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:39,817
Whatever happens,
I will not beg for your help.

289
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:44,572
Why won't anything
worse than thieves come here?

290
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,826
S... Sorry...

291
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,205
Because of King Harald's authority.

292
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:55,625
<i>Ketil sends an exorbitant amount</i>

293
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,545
<i>of tribute to the king twice a year.</i>

294
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:01,297
<i>As long as the king accepts it,</i>

295
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:04,801
<i>he has an obligation to protect Ketil.</i>

296
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,222
It is foolish...

297
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:12,433
to buy peace with money.

298
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:17,272
What is the point of owning a farm
that is too big for a farmer

299
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:18,731
to protect?

300
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,526
Do you know how many days

301
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,528
it takes to get here from Jelling?

302
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:27,365
We are the ones
who are actually protecting the farm.

303
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,994
Too much wealth brings forth disaster.

304
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:32,203
Did you just ignore me?

305
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:35,665
When you increase your wealth
you fear losing it.

306
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:39,961
To deal with that fear you use money.
Then you try to earn more.

307
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:44,716
My stupid son
doesn't realize how futile that is.

308
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:50,596
My goodness,

309
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:52,849
old men love to lecture people.

310
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:58,604
Oh! It stopped raining!

311
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,863
All right!
I guess I'll go do some guard duty.

312
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,072
Don't come back!

313
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:17,248
I know you get lonely when I don't visit.

314
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,791
Get out already!

315
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:28,468
What a strange duo.

316
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:31,554
They seem to get along better than
the real father and son.

317
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:32,722
Yeah.

318
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:35,141
I feel like

319
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,352
I learned a lot of things today.

320
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:44,400
Good for you, big baby.

321
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,610
Don't call me that.

322
00:22:56,662 --> 00:22:59,207
Too much wealth, huh?

323
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:19,310
You can sow them more thoroughly.

324
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,522
But this is all we have, right?

325
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:24,565
It's fine!

326
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:26,526
Don't hold back.

327
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:28,903
Trust what your friend tells you.

328
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:31,030
- Friend?
- What?

329
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:33,157
No way.

330
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:36,452
What's with that reaction?
We're friends, right?

331
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:39,205
Am I wrong?

332
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:50,424
No, you're right...

333
00:23:54,595 --> 00:23:55,763
we're friends.

334
