1
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,634
What the hell!

2
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:22,555
Just let us do it tomorrow! Not today!

3
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:24,849
Hey, I'm just the messenger.

4
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:28,227
Anyway, the mistress insisted
that it be done today.

5
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:29,603
That old hag.

6
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:32,147
All the other times, she leaves us

7
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:33,899
in charge of guard duty.

8
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:37,236
Maybe it has something to do with
the reward of three horses.

9
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,697
She wants a part of the reward?

10
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:41,574
What a greedy old hag.

11
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,624
Jeez...

12
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,044
Snake,

13
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,338
will you

14
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:59,466
let me see my husband, Gardar?

15
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,885
No.

16
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,431
He's injured, isn't he?

17
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,391
How...

18
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,935
How are his wounds?

19
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,771
How would I know?

20
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:16,901
Why do I have to care for
an enemy who killed my subordinate?

21
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:21,488
Boss, here's a horse.

22
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:24,658
All right.
We'll be at the mistress' place.

23
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,245
You go and take Arnheid
back to Gramps' house.

24
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:39,298
They took the horses
so we don't have any left.

25
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:42,927
Are you serious? I have to walk...

26
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,470
her back?

27
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,105
Please, let me see my husband.

28
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,734
I swear I'm not thinking of
helping him escape.

29
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,111
I just want to care for his wounds.

30
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,906
Huh? Well...

31
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:10,204
But the boss said...

32
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,590
Hey!

33
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,218
What's going on?

34
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:27,346
She's the cutie from Master Ketil's place.

35
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,057
Uh, the boss...

36
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,184
The boss gave her permission

37
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:35,187
to care for Gardar's wounds.
I'm not lying!

38
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:45,531
Gardar...

39
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:48,993
Arnheid!

40
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:27,156
You were beaten?

41
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:32,870
Please cut this rope, Arnheid.

42
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,789
Let's go home.

43
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,376
- Hey...
- It's fine.

44
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,795
She doesn't have any tools
that can cut the rope.

45
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,423
If you say so.

46
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,759
Hey, Arnheid!

47
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,803
Your husband came
all the way here to take you back.

48
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:54,183
Forget about his wounds. Why don't you
give him something more special?

49
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:00,064
I can't care for his wounds
if he's tied up like this.

50
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:02,316
Can you untie him just for now?

51
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:05,360
That's not going to happen.

52
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,404
His "thing" isn't tied up, though.

53
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,573
You can still take care of that.

54
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:12,743
That's right!

55
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:18,207
Arnheid...

56
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,010
I will

58
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,137
never

59
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:34,598
leave you and Hjalti

60
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:36,683
alone again.

61
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:39,603
Never again...

62
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:44,817
I was wrong.

63
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:48,112
Please forgive me,

64
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:50,906
Arnheid.

65
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,687
I made you suffer so much.

66
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,189
Let's start over.

67
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,650
Let's go back to how it was.

68
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:30,946
Please let me free.

69
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:36,034
I'm sorry, Gardar.

70
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:39,037
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,837
What are you saying?

72
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:50,090
I'm the one who must
ask for your forgiveness.

73
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:54,178
Come now, Arnheid.

74
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:56,138
Get a hold of yourself.

75
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,149
That ruined the mood.

76
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:12,404
It's starting to rain harder.
I'll take a rest in the hut.

77
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,406
What? Hey!

78
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,533
We were told to keep watch.

79
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,244
One person is enough.

80
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:21,288
You're the one who brought that woman,

81
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,540
so you take responsibility.

82
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,293
Seriously?

83
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:31,757
Hey.

84
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,469
Hey, Arnheid!

85
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,805
Are you done? Isn't that enough?

86
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:51,443
My only fault
is that I'm a sucker for women.

87
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:54,446
Your time's up.

88
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:58,075
Come on, get up.

89
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:13,609
Arnheid! He has a knife on his belt.

90
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:15,902
Use that to cut my rope.

91
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,906
Hurry up! Arnheid!

92
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:25,495
Hey! This is bad! He's dead!

93
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,205
I don't know! Just hurry!

94
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,415
Get it together!

95
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:30,208
Hurry up!

96
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,002
My rope!

97
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,088
We'll both be killed!

98
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,304
Arnheid!

99
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,748
It's no use, Boss.

100
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:12,084
None of them are breathing.

101
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:17,964
Those idiots.

102
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:22,052
I told them to not let their guard down
so many times.

103
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:28,850
Over here, Boss.

104
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:33,105
His sword...

105
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:36,483
Take a look at the tip.

106
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:41,071
The rain washed away the blood,
but there's still oil on it.

107
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:43,365
He must have stabbed his opponent.

108
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:46,827
- That's a deep wound.
- Yes.

109
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:50,205
He was wounded
on top of being wounded already.

110
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,375
There were no horses here either.

111
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:56,461
Go after him!

112
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:59,214
He hasn't gone far.

113
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,717
We will settle this on this farm!

114
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:05,720
As soon as I find him

115
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:09,558
I will kill him.

116
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:46,136
You couldn't sleep,

117
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,220
Einar?

118
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,727
You haven't slept yourself.

119
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:56,438
You weren't woken up by a nightmare.

120
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:01,276
Yeah...

121
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,154
Were you keeping an eye on me?

122
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,407
Did you think I would

123
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:09,493
do something crazy during the night?

124
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:13,788
I wouldn't.

125
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,500
I don't want to make
life harder for Arnheid.

126
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,423
It's not fair, is it?

127
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:28,220
We were just living in peace, that's all.

128
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:32,182
Violence

129
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:35,644
has robbed us of our freedom,
and that's just wrong.

130
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,146
It must be wrong.

131
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,322
<i>As someone</i>

132
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,992
<i>who was doing nothing but fighting wars,</i>

133
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,662
<i>I don't have the right to say anything.</i>

134
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:55,705
<i>But...</i>

135
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,416
it's wrong.

136
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,961
It was wrong.

137
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,090
Arnheid

138
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,717
doesn't know that
you used to be a warrior.

139
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,847
I'm pathetic.

140
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,099
I'm scared

141
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:17,561
of the thought of people like her
finding that out about me.

142
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:22,065
<i>How was I able to hurt all those people</i>

143
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:24,067
<i>like it was nothing?</i>

144
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,905
I can't even imagine

145
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:30,156
you being that way.

146
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,620
Hey Thorfinn,

147
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,748
you know that thing you mentioned before?

148
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,751
- Are you serious about it?
- What?

149
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:44,796
Remember you asked me if I thought

150
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,215
it was possible to rid this world

151
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,758
of war and slavery?

152
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:53,305
It just sounds like a dream to me.

153
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:56,558
But as someone who has
experienced both sides,

154
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:58,768
I bet you can come up with an idea.

155
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:03,648
What do we need to do?

156
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:05,901
How do we

157
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:09,154
get rid of war and slavery?

158
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:15,243
I only know

159
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:18,038
about the things I experienced myself.

160
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:23,627
<i>But there's no doubt that wars
produce many slaves.</i>

161
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:27,130
<i>Those who are defeated in war</i>

162
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,424
<i>are turned into slaves.</i>

163
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,054
<i>Just as you and Arnheid were.</i>

164
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:39,267
<i>The line between warriors
and slave traders is ambiguous.</i>

165
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:43,688
There are other things
that lead to slavery,

166
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:46,066
but I think the biggest cause is war.

167
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,570
If the number of wars decline
the number of slaves will too.

168
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:57,327
But Nordic men

169
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:00,497
don't view war as something bad.

170
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:05,835
<i>Nordic men measure their worth
by valor and wealth.</i>

171
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,797
<i>The more people you kill</i>

172
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:12,342
<i>and the more wealth you return with,
the more you are respected.</i>

173
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:16,596
<i>That is why fathers
teach their sons how to fight,</i>

174
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:20,100
<i>give them weapons and armor,
and take them on warships.</i>

175
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,603
<i>That has always been
the normal thing to do</i>

176
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,772
<i>for us Nordic men.</i>

177
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,695
Whatever it is, it's always difficult
to stop doing what is considered the norm.

178
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,866
But there are also men like you.

179
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:40,453
Is vowing to never hurt another person

180
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,539
such a strange thing to do?

181
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,710
In Nordic society,

182
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:49,504
cowards cannot survive.

183
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:55,885
But that's fine.

184
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,556
If it means I don't have to
carry any more of them,

185
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:02,225
I would happily be an outcast.

186
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:05,186
"Them"?

187
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,652
The dead.

188
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:17,782
The people I have killed.

189
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:21,786
<i>Their ghosts appear before me
almost every night</i>

190
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:24,414
<i>and torment me.</i>

191
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,958
<i>They say, "Why did you kill?</i>

192
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,835
<i>After your father was killed,</i>

193
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:31,921
<i>you were so angry and resentful.</i>

194
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:34,924
<i>So why did you, out of all people,
kill so many</i>

195
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:37,177
<i>fathers, brothers, and sons?"</i>

196
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,014
<i>I have to make amends</i>

197
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:43,558
<i>for what I did to these people.</i>

198
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,978
<i>I have to take these people to a place</i>

199
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,105
<i>where they can rest in peace.</i>

200
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,526
I'm at my limit.

201
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:58,156
I can't take on even one more person.

202
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:06,873
I'm constantly thinking

203
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,794
about how I can repay them.

204
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:15,924
Vowing to never kill
or destroy anything anymore isn't enough

205
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:17,759
to be called atonement.

206
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:24,140
To make up for all the wheat
I've trampled on,

207
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,267
I have to grow more with my own hands.

208
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:30,313
To make up for
all the houses I've burned down,

209
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:32,440
I have to build more with my own hands.

210
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:37,320
I still don't know how to
rid this entire world

211
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,155
of war altogether.

212
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:43,993
But even if it's just
one place in this world...

213
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:46,746
It could even be just one village...

214
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,834
I want to create

215
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,545
a place where we no longer need swords.

216
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:06,474
But

217
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:09,144
how would you protect that place?

218
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,772
I hate war myself.

219
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:17,652
But Vikings will come wherever you are.

220
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:21,030
Sometimes you have to fight

221
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,241
to protect your peace and freedom.

222
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:27,954
But

223
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:31,291
that won't do.

224
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,420
<i>There's no point
if you use war to keep peace.</i>

225
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,630
<i>If you do,</i>

226
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,758
<i>you'll never be able to escape
from that bloodstained hell.</i>

227
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:48,224
I guess

228
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:51,477
a story that sounds like a dream

229
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:53,563
is nothing but a dream.

230
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:58,776
We have to go to the ends of the earth,

231
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:01,112
somewhere far, far away.

232
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,074
Somewhere even Vikings can't get to.

233
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,245
A land

234
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:12,207
just for outcasts.

235
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,426
<i>If we run away far beyond the ocean,</i>

236
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:26,679
<i>I wonder what we'll find there.</i>

237
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:30,433
<i>I'm sure</i>

238
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,435
<i>there will be nothing.</i>

239
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:36,898
<i>No matter how far you go,
it'll be the same as it is here.</i>

240
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,527
<i>There will only be war and slave traders.</i>

241
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:52,538
Far west...

242
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,208
Beyond the ocean...

243
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:04,384
<i>A land out of the reach of any ruler,</i>

244
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:07,303
<i>a land no slave trader knows about,</i>

245
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:10,306
<i>a land far beyond the horizon.</i>

246
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:15,728
There is actually a place like that?

247
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:19,315
There is. I had forgotten about it.

248
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:22,151
When I was a child, a sailor named Leif

249
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:24,237
told me about it.

250
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:27,740
<i>Beyond the vast ocean to the west,</i>

251
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,285
<i>there supposedly is fertile land.</i>

252
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:33,371
<i>He said there's land that's untouched.</i>

253
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:38,626
That's amazing.

254
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,380
Then... Then if we go there...

255
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,881
No...

256
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:47,760
He also told me
that it is tremendously far.

257
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,846
And I don't know the exact location.

258
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:54,684
Plus, we're talking about
building a nation.

259
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:57,854
We have to take a multitude
of outcasts there.

260
00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:00,148
It'll be a huge project.

261
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:08,156
I see.

262
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,034
But you know,

263
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:16,247
that's the best thing
I've heard in a while.

264
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,489
Be careful.

265
00:22:50,156 --> 00:22:51,324
He's strong.

266
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,704
Wh... What is going on

267
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:58,498
so early in the morning?

268
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,464
It doesn't seem like anyone's here.

269
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:09,258
I can't tell with all this junk.

270
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:12,261
Throw everything out!

271
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:18,392
Jeez, what is this all about?

272
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:21,938
He escaped.

273
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:25,650
- What?
- Gardar escaped.

274
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,445
Is there any other reason
why they would be ransacking our shed?

275
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,495
Arnheid!

276
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:38,741
<i>''Cause.''</i>

277
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:39,992
