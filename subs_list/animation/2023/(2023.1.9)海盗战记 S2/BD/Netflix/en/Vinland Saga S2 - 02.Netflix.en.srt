BASED ON THE MANGA BY MAKOTO YUKIMURA

2
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:43,057
Einar, Thorfinn,
from today you two will be friends.

3
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,522
Come on, introduce yourselves.

4
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:53,692
I'll have you two work on the same job.
Cooperate with each other, okay?

5
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,946
Nice to meet you, Thorfinn.

6
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,073
Hello.

7
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:03,410
All right. Let me explain about the job.

8
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,832
Einar, what does this look like to you?

9
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,584
Um...

10
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:13,337
Is it a forest?

11
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:16,632
That's not quite right.

12
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:21,011
This is a future wheat field.

13
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,891
This forest belongs to me.

14
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,394
But I will lease it to you two.

15
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,272
- Lease?
- Yes.

16
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:33,107
I'll leave everything to you.

17
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:37,194
Clear the land, manage it,
and harvest the crop.

18
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:39,655
I will buy that from you at a proper rate.

19
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,909
When your earnings surpass
the price at which you were bought,

20
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,536
buy yourselves out.

21
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:53,836
Buy ourselves? You mean...
we can become free?

22
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,338
Yes, that's right.

23
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:59,592
Use your own power
and the right procedure to become free.

24
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,553
Depending on how hard you work,

25
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:05,639
you can do so within three years.

26
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:09,518
I won't charge you the lease payment
until your first harvest.

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,023
What's wrong? Do you disapprove?

28
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:19,486
No! Thank you! I will do my best.

29
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:25,034
If there are any problems
or you have any questions,

30
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:27,453
ask Pater.

31
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:29,872
He knows the farm very well.

32
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,749
Nice to meet you.

33
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:35,252
I bought my freedom in the same way.

34
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:38,380
I know it's tough being in a foreign land
but do your best.

35
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,049
Yes!

36
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:44,553
Just watch how Thorfinn works for today.

37
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:47,389
You must be tired from the long trip.

38
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,562
Thorfinn, take care of Einar, okay?

39
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,564
- Got it?
- Yes.

40
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:06,283
Hey, is the master... What?

41
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:10,746
Hey, wait a second.

42
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:15,459
Hey, what kind of person is the master?

43
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:22,675
Is this normal in Denmark?

44
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:25,886
There were slaves in my homeland too,

45
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:28,597
but slaves were always slaves.

46
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,938
I was born in the north of England.

47
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:37,564
What about you?

48
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,194
Iceland.

49
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:45,864
Iceland, huh?

50
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:48,867
Iceland is...

51
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:50,911
where?

52
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,625
Wow... You cut down quite a lot already.

53
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,627
How much more to go?

54
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,465
All of this side.

55
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:05,259
This side?

56
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,097
You see that river?

57
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:13,017
Everything on this side of the river.

58
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:17,479
On this side of the river?

59
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:22,192
That means...

60
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:27,573
we still have quite a lot to do?

61
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:47,760
What?

62
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,063
What is it?

63
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:02,066
Didn't he tell you to just watch?

64
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:07,321
I want to be free as soon as possible.
Is that wrong?

65
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,743
In that case, do me a favor
and choose a tree farther away.

66
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:16,580
Also, cut it so that it falls
perpendicular to the river.

67
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:19,124
I see.

68
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,293
We're transporting them using the river?

69
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,845
I'm so hungry.

70
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:34,473
How does lunch work here?

71
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:37,726
They serve it.

72
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:43,732
That's great.
Do we go somewhere to get it?

73
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:47,069
No, a farmhand should deliver it soon.

74
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,739
Are you serious? What great service.

75
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:55,661
- No way!
- I'm serious!

76
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,746
Our food! Isn't that right, Thorfinn?

77
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,003
I'm serious. You're the only one
who hasn't done it.

78
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,883
I had no clue! Maybe I'll go tonight then.

79
00:07:10,717 --> 00:07:13,137
Yeah, go ahead. And get dumped.

80
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:14,388
Come on!

81
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,892
Hey, isn't that the newbie?

82
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:21,353
Seems like it.

83
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:24,481
What a dumb face. Fitting for a slave.

84
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:26,692
Hello, I'm...

85
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:30,946
- We know. We heard.
- Um...

86
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:37,369
- What's this?
- Your lunch.

87
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:43,167
All right, tonight's the night.

88
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,586
Um, is this...

89
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,547
Like I said, it's your lunch.

90
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,385
This measly thing?

91
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:56,889
What? Do you have a problem with that?

92
00:07:58,182 --> 00:07:59,391
Well, it's more like...

93
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:02,561
This is for two people?

94
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,858
- Did you hear him?
- Jeez...

95
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:11,570
Hey, is this your first job as a slave?

96
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:13,989
Yeah.

97
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:18,494
Then remember this.
You're lucky to even get food.

98
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:22,789
And we free people came
all the way here to drop off lunch.

99
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:26,001
The first thing you should do
is say thank you.

100
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:29,880
<i>These guys...</i>

101
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,133
Come on, say it.

102
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:36,011
"Thank you very much."

103
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:43,352
What's with those eyes, you brat?

104
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:50,234
I'll take this. Thank you very much.

105
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:01,662
Teach that guy some manners, Thorfinn.

106
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,874
Also, don't hurt the horse.

107
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:07,918
Yes.

108
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:19,680
They're taking a nap...

109
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:24,059
What's up with them?
They just came to play hooky.

110
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:26,645
You too...

111
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:30,148
Stop kissing up to them
just because you're a slave.

112
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:35,320
Einar, push it from the back.

113
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,863
I'll pull it from the front.

114
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:43,537
Once we get to the bank,
we'll make a raft.

115
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:48,125
Shouldn't we cut this wood a little more?

116
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,669
It's impossible with just one old horse.

117
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:55,173
The trees belong to the master.
We can't cut them without permission.

118
00:09:56,675 --> 00:10:00,470
Hey, isn't this supposed to be their job?

119
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,015
They don't usually let slaves
handle horses.

120
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,728
- And why is there only one old horse?
- Whatever, let's get to it.

121
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:20,282
- Einar!
- Right!

122
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:33,170
Einar, lift the front part.

123
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:35,339
Got it!

124
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:46,141
Let's go.

125
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:13,293
I'm so hungry I feel nauseous.

126
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,340
I'll never forgive those guys.

127
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:20,842
How dare they eat my lunch.

128
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:26,473
Hands are basically people who
have no choice but to work for the master

129
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:29,226
because they don't have
their own land, right?

130
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,644
Yeah.

131
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,064
What the heck!

132
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,442
That's the same as being half enslaved!

133
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:41,822
They're bullying us just to feel assured
that there are people below them.

134
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:48,203
Thorfinn! You think so too, right?

135
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:51,164
I don't know.

136
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,709
I couldn't care less about that.

137
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,923
You have to care!

138
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:02,759
We are the master's property!

139
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,054
It's unacceptable for
mere farmhands to exploit us.

140
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,056
I'll tell the master.

141
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:13,186
Don't do that.
It'll only make the harassment worse.

142
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:19,234
You... You're okay with this?

143
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:28,118
- Einar, Thorfinn!
- Master...

144
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:33,957
Einar, what are your thoughts
after spending a day here?

145
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:37,043
- Um, I have to report--
- Stop it.

146
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:41,131
Shut up! Excuse me,
I have something to report.

147
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:45,343
Today, the farmhands... that...

148
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,322
What do you want to report, Einar?

149
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:12,245
What a strange man.
If it's nothing, I'm going to get going.

150
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,519
Einar...

151
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:40,023
You didn't need to report it?

152
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:46,655
Shut up.

153
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:19,229
- It's so hot today.
- We've got water!

154
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:23,108
It's fresh from the spring.

155
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,442
It's cold!

156
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,820
Give me a cup!

157
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,989
Quick turn!

158
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:35,495
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

159
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,581
We went to the deep spring this time.

160
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,711
I feel revived! Thank you.

161
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:46,006
- You're welcome.
- All right.

162
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:50,260
Okay, everyone! We're almost there.

163
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,555
- Let's finish this area before noon.
- Yes, sir!

164
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,560
The master works himself, huh?

165
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,147
I always thought rich people didn't work.

166
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,611
When you see them working like this,

167
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:11,364
there is no difference between
the Danes and English.

168
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:18,413
Hey, you're doing it wrong!

169
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:20,916
Don't make me repeat myself, Olmar.

170
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,669
What the heck? I'm doing
exactly what you told me to do.

171
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,588
Use a sickle.

172
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:30,216
And you have to cut them below the knee.

173
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:31,843
I've already told you this!

174
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,430
- It doesn't even matter how you cut them.
- What!

175
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,017
You fool! Once the wheat is done,
we have to pasture the animals.

176
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:43,563
We leave more stubble
so we can feed it to the livestock later.

177
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:48,693
You are already 17 years old
and you still don't know the process.

178
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:52,405
That's why you can't understand
the significance of each step.

179
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,076
Enough already... I know all of that.

180
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,036
I've got the process down perfectly.

181
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:01,831
Show more humility
when someone's talking to you!

182
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:03,875
As someone with authority--

183
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,378
Okay, okay! Below the knee, right?

184
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:09,089
Understood!

185
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,926
You fool! What is with that swing!

186
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:15,178
You're going to damage the ears of wheat!

187
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:17,639
- You said below the knee!
- What is going on?

188
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,808
He's getting yelled at like crazy.

189
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:21,935
He's Olmar, the master's son.

190
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:24,062
Oh, they're father and son...

191
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,148
I can't take this anymore!

192
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:32,278
For once I decide to help you out,
but all you do is nitpick on the details.

193
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,825
I'm done.
I was going to work, but never mind.

194
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:39,911
Hey! Where do you think
you're going, Olmar?!

195
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,664
Away from you, you old man!

196
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:45,750
In time, you will be inheriting this farm.

197
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,460
Act more responsibly.

198
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,798
When did I ever ask you
to let me inherit it!

199
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:56,344
I'm a grown man!
I don't have time to be doing teeny-tiny

200
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:59,180
insignificant jobs out in the field!

201
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,057
I'm going to use this...

202
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:06,438
Huh?

203
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:14,112
- Hey, what is he doing?
- I wonder...

204
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,582
I'll rise up the ranks with this sword!

205
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:28,918
- Damn it!
- Olmar! Wait, you little...

206
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:37,510
Very soon, I am going to England. I swear.

207
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,975
I'm not going to spend
my whole life out in these boondocks.

208
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:47,562
I'm going to enlist
in Prince Canute's army

209
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,856
and make a name for myself!

210
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:07,916
Um...

211
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,252
Young master, how soon is "very soon"?

212
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:14,130
Very soon means very soon.

213
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,343
In time, King Harald will convene
a fleet for reinforcements.

214
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:23,389
I think it would be best
for you to take over this farm.

215
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:27,560
Huh? You too? What do you know anyway?

216
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,604
No, I mean...

217
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:32,941
I'm just so worried.

218
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:41,783
Hey...

219
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:45,703
Let's do it one more time...

220
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:50,250
<i>Yes! Good job, my daughter!</i>

221
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,961
<i>- Keep it up.</i>
- How is it going?

222
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:55,547
I brought a meal for the young master.

223
00:18:57,257 --> 00:19:01,052
Not now. They're about to start round two.

224
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:04,681
Oh, my! Oh, my...

225
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:11,563
Anyway, now our family
has nothing to worry about.

226
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:12,939
That's right.

227
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:16,901
As long as the young master
continues to favor her...

228
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:28,496
What is the matter, young master?

229
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:30,623
Did our daughter
do something to upset you?

230
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,543
Shut up, you idiot!

231
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:37,297
I know what you're all up to.
You poor tenant farmers!

232
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,675
You're after my dad's fortune.

233
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:44,429
You want to become relatives of
the Ketil family and live lavishly!

234
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,681
We've never thought about that!

235
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:51,895
You women are always like this!

236
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:55,690
Young master! That was not our intention!

237
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,942
Young master, please wait!

238
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:02,030
Damn it! Damn all of you!

239
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,824
I'm my own person!
Not a freebie that's attached to my dad!

240
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:08,328
Damn it! This is unbearable!

241
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:12,081
Oh, it's the young master.

242
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,334
What? Young master?

243
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:17,962
- Young master!
- Hey!

244
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:23,051
What are you doing?

245
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:26,596
- It's dangerous to be riding at night.
- Dangerous!

246
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,599
And what are you two doing?

247
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,395
<i>We'll be right there</i>

248
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:37,607
Come on, use your feet.

249
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:41,694
You know, we went to see that woman

250
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:44,656
but the farmhands got there before us.

251
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:46,616
Hey, the wheat...

252
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,786
But if we get in a fight with them

253
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:53,164
our boss will get mad at us again.

254
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:58,127
- It's ridiculous, you know?
- Ridiculous!

255
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,296
Must be nice to be you.

256
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:04,759
You're free to do
whatever you want on this farm.

257
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,513
Shut up. You wouldn't know how I feel.

258
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:12,976
Oh, are you mad? Are you?
Is something bothering you?

259
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:15,395
Don't be mad!

260
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:19,274
I don't have any time to waste on you two.

261
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:22,026
Go back to the fort and go to sleep.

262
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:26,489
Now, now... Don't be so prickly.

263
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:28,950
- You're still young.
- You're so cold.

264
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,494
Hey, don't grab onto the muzzle.

265
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:35,039
Don't worry.
Let's just get some more drinks.

266
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,418
Let's talk the night away, young master.

267
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:40,545
Tell us about your worries as a youth.

268
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:45,091
You just want to be
entertained by my stories!

269
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:48,720
Don't be ridiculous! I'm leaving! Let go!

270
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:03,943
Why can't he just inherit it
without complaining...?

271
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:06,571
He doesn't know war.

272
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:10,867
He's under the impression
that warriors are cool.

273
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:17,707
People who fight wars are all animals.

274
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:23,087
Go to sleep.
We have an early morning tomorrow.

275
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:27,592
In the past, the village where I lived

276
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,636
<i>was attacked by soldiers twice.</i>

277
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:38,644
<i>The army sent by the King of England</i>

278
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:41,606
<i>burnt down all the houses in the village.</i>

279
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:46,861
<i>My dad fought back, but he was killed.</i>

280
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,113
<i>I...</i>

281
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,657
<i>couldn't do anything but watch.</i>

282
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:00,208
The second time

283
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,710
was by Danish soldiers.

284
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:10,885
<i>They said they were rescuing us
from the tyrannical King of England.</i>

285
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:14,555
<i>But they just plundered
the entire village.</i>

286
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:25,983
They're disguised as humans,
but they're nothing

287
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:27,985
but animals.

288
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:35,576
Hey, Thorfinn...

289
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,620
Did you fall asleep?

290
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:39,408
<i>"Snake."</i>

291
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:40,993
