1
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,966
Which one? Where is he?

2
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,136
Which one? That one?

3
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:20,975
Oh, that one?
The one bent over on the table?

4
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:23,894
That's right. That young man.

5
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,147
Okay, that makes sense.

6
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:29,775
He looks like the type.

7
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,861
The man who lost to a pig.

8
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:35,781
I can't believe such a person exists!

9
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:40,286
He has some nerve
to say he wants to become a thegn.

10
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:47,376
So, all we have to do is tell him
that he failed?

11
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:49,920
That's right, you just have to tell him.

12
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,466
All right, that's fine with me.

13
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:55,301
Man,

14
00:00:56,093 --> 00:00:59,430
I'm not sure if I can
keep it at that, though.

15
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,682
Do you want to tease him?

16
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,019
I mean, look at his dumb-looking face.

17
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:11,817
Go. I'll treat you to drinks later.

18
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:13,569
- Okay.
- Okay.

19
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,321
You're laughing too much.

20
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,782
- I can't help it!
- You are too!

21
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:36,550
Speaking of dumb-looking faces, you guys

22
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,968
aren't that different.

23
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:18,485
Olmar!

24
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:23,782
Olmar! Excuse me.

25
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:31,498
My name is Brodd.

26
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:34,043
I am a member of the late king's corps.

27
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,296
And?

28
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:40,424
And I came here to relay
a message from Sir Wulf,

29
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:43,302
the captain of King Canute's thegns.

30
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:45,804
I know I failed.

31
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:47,932
Now, now...

32
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:51,936
This is our job.
Just let us deliver the message.

33
00:03:56,023 --> 00:04:02,738
Olmar, about your request
to join the king's thegns...

34
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:05,658
"Your will to offer
your life to His Majesty

35
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:09,703
is splendid indeed,"
are the captain's words.

36
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:16,460
However, upon witnessing your skills,
the captain has said

37
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:20,631
that your swordsmanship
has room for improvement.

38
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:28,138
Therefore, I regret to inform you that...

39
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:32,726
I regret to inform you that...

40
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:46,740
There's nothing to regret!
You lost to a pig!

41
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,537
Stop it! Don't say that out loud!

42
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:53,330
I can't breathe!

43
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,877
I heard you couldn't cut a pig?

44
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,713
Why is that?

45
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:04,008
Was the pig wearing
a chain mail or something?

46
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:07,761
Actually, if it was a pig,
was it wearing a swine mail?

47
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:20,524
Pardon us. We shouldn't laugh at you.

48
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,319
His job hunt isn't going well.

49
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,906
Why don't you guys refer him for a job?

50
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:32,536
Oh, the chef at the palace
was looking for a helper.

51
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,413
He can't do it.

52
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,290
He can't even cut a pig!

53
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:04,943
As a warrior, I will make you pay
for your humiliation with my sword.

54
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,862
Take up your sword!

55
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:16,246
But you can't even cut a pig!

56
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:19,875
I'm going to die from laughing too much!

57
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:25,547
What the heck!

58
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:29,301
That wasn't nice, you weakling.

59
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:36,892
- Come on, hurry!
- Wait!

60
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,310
It's a fight!

61
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,521
They're by the stalls.
It's five against one.

62
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:44,942
- They're using swords!
- That means we get to see blood!

63
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,028
- Do it!
- Kill him!

64
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,239
You can do it, young 'un!

65
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:52,032
I'll fight him alone.

66
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,868
If we gang up on someone
who can't even cut a pig,

67
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,537
it'll be a disgrace.

68
00:06:57,788 --> 00:06:59,164
Don't lose.

69
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:03,544
My, my, you're so serious.

70
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:08,841
I'll help train you, Olmar.

71
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,933
Come on, get up. Try harder.

72
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:30,821
Jeez, he's as pathetic as they say he is.

73
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,469
Stand up, Olmar.

74
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:56,430
Don't sleep during a duel.

75
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,229
Brother...

76
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,275
Brother, I was

77
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,903
...humiliated.

78
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,906
I can tell just by looking.

79
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:16,408
Hurry up and get up and kill that guy.

80
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:27,669
Stand up.

81
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,888
Stand up, Olmar!

82
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:45,270
He's so strong...

83
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,899
Brother... I...

84
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,401
Listen to me, Olmar.

85
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:54,780
There are only two options left
for a warrior who is humiliated.

86
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:58,033
To kill or to die.

87
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,868
If you can't kill him, then die.

88
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:05,582
I will not allow you to
go on with life and ignore

89
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:07,793
the fact that you were humiliated.

90
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:12,047
Fight and become a man.

91
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,633
Today will be the day.

92
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:17,844
- Brother...
- Go on!

93
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:23,267
What's up with him?

94
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:26,895
Imagine it, Olmar.

95
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:29,565
Imagine yourself chopping off his head.

96
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:31,650
Yes...

97
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:35,028
Project your voice
from the bottom of your stomach.

98
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:37,656
- Yes!
- More!

99
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:38,657
Yes!

100
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:43,412
Imagine your enemy writhing
in his own blood and guts

101
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,330
and crying tears of regret!

102
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,540
Yes!

103
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,042
Get ready, Olmar!

104
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,294
Yes!

105
00:09:50,294 --> 00:09:52,879
Kill that jerk! Kill him!

106
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,006
Yes!

107
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:56,049
Go!

108
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:03,515
After all that egging,
he thinks he can do it.

109
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,814
Your training is done.

110
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,711
You did it!

111
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:34,296
Unbelievable!

112
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:36,715
He can actually fight!

113
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,009
This is getting exciting!

114
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,345
Amazing!

115
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:44,264
- You were great!
- Keep it up!

116
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,020
Seriously?

117
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:53,607
- Come on!
- That bastard!

118
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,776
Don't let him get away alive!

119
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:58,403
We have to clear our name
right here, right now!

120
00:10:58,403 --> 00:10:59,571
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

121
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,574
Good job, Olmar.

122
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:04,743
That's what I expect from my brother.

123
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:09,414
Now leave the rest to me.

124
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:28,725
<i>He died?</i>

125
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:32,312
<i>I killed him?</i>

126
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,920
<i>I killed... someone?</i>

127
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:17,315
His eye...

128
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:21,027
It was punctured by a rock or something.

129
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,282
Olmar! Thorgil!

130
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:28,785
Move! Get out of the way!

131
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:37,335
Wh... What's going on?!

132
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:39,754
What happened?

133
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:46,261
You...

134
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:47,554
What...

135
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,309
Calm down, Dad.

136
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:55,562
Calm down? You're telling me to calm down?

137
00:12:55,562 --> 00:13:00,150
You killed the king's messenger!

138
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,278
What are you going to do about this? This...

139
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,530
We are not in the wrong.

140
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,823
What?

141
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:10,827
Olmar was humiliated and it led to a duel.
He defended his honor.

142
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:11,786
But--

143
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:13,580
It was five against one.

144
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,125
They can't complain
that I joined in to help.

145
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,337
If you're his parent,
you should commend Olmar.

146
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:27,511
Duels are banned by the law.

147
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:31,389
Nobody follows that law.

148
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,935
If they're carrying around swords,

149
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:38,271
they should know that humiliation
comes with a price.

150
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:41,525
They knew that and still disparaged Olmar.

151
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:44,277
They're rude guys who deserve to die.

152
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:49,908
Out of the way! Make way!

153
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:51,159
What?

154
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,370
They're guards!

155
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,330
We are not wrong.

156
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,334
Duels like this happen all the time.
Normally, we won't be punished.

157
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:06,967
Who is the one brazenly
causing a commotion

158
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,135
in His Majesty's territory?

159
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:13,557
Give up and show yourselves.

160
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,187
What's going on? Olmar is still alive.

161
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:23,066
Even Ketil is here. Who is that other guy?

162
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:26,987
I don't know.
He's probably a family member.

163
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,326
I am King Canute's thegn,
Thorgil, son of Ketil.

164
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:36,246
My father Ketil
and younger brother Olmar are here.

165
00:14:37,122 --> 00:14:38,707
It was an honest-to-goodness duel.

166
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,376
We did nothing wrong.

167
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:46,464
Silence! Duels are banned by the king.

168
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:52,637
You bastards disrespected the king.

169
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:54,264
You are under arrest.

170
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,850
I knew it.

171
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,895
I told you... I told you, Thorgil.

172
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:06,735
Bring your hands back!

173
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:07,819
Don't clench them!

174
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,739
Wait a second! I am--

175
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:14,826
Hand over your sword
and put your hands behind your back.

176
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,705
Hey, did you not hear me?

177
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:31,760
He did it...

178
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,889
You bastard!

179
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:09,881
How... How dare you!

180
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:27,273
Wh... Have you lost your mind, Thorgil?

181
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,902
We're done for! There's no turning back!

182
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:37,867
I have something to ask you,
you underling.

183
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,080
I'm impatient.

184
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,582
Be mindful of how you answer me.

185
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,126
If you answer, I'll spare you.

186
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:50,213
Why did you make Olmar win?

187
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:52,424
Huh?

188
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:55,427
"Make" me win?

189
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,053
Tell me.

190
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:58,430
I... I didn't know--

191
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:08,648
I warned you.

192
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,067
Tell me.

193
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,361
Why did you trick Olmar?

194
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,991
It was...

195
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:22,787
to arrest Ketil.

196
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:25,206
In order to arrest Ketil

197
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:28,543
in the name of
collective punishment for the treason

198
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:31,171
and lese majesty committed by his son,

199
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:35,050
we made him kill the king's messenger.

200
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:43,016
What have I ever done to deserve this?

201
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,772
All I did was obey Sir Wulf's orders.

202
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:51,775
Please let me get treatment.

203
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:56,529
It's bleeding... It won't stop bleeding!

204
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:01,618
It's all over...
King Canute is targeting me.

205
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:07,665
You're wrong, Dad.

206
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,543
Thorgil...

207
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,131
This is just the beginning.

208
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:17,008
We're up against a powerful enemy.

209
00:18:38,905 --> 00:18:40,490
I see...

210
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,660
Ketil and his family escaped, huh?

211
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,830
I apologize, Your Majesty.

212
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:49,666
We're staking out their ship and inn,

213
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,876
but they haven't shown up.

214
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,586
We're currently searching.

215
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,132
It is my responsibility for not being able

216
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,716
to restrain Thorgil.

217
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:02,720
He seems to be a very skilled warrior.

218
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,640
Yes, he was a good subordinate.

219
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,644
It doesn't affect our plan.

220
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:12,689
We still have an excuse
to execute judgement.

221
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:16,025
We will head to Ketil's farm
according to schedule.

222
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:19,529
If Ketil is not there, so be it.

223
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:23,366
If he is there and resists,
we just have to subdue them.

224
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,617
Yes, sir.

225
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,411
I will dispatch 32 thegns

226
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,080
to be Your Majesty's bodyguards.

227
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,250
Floki and his Jomsvikings
would be an additional 70,

228
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,836
so we will have an army of 102 soldiers.

229
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:39,674
That should be enough.
When will Floki arrive?

230
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:42,468
He'll arrive from Jomsborg
within three days.

231
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,183
Well then, in three days,
we will depart at dawn.

232
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:49,350
You may leave.

233
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,476
Yes, sir.

234
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:19,380
What are you laughing at, King Sweyn?

235
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:22,759
Don't be so mad.

236
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,762
There's nothing wrong with a father

237
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:30,141
being happy to see his son
growing up to be just like him.

238
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,275
Keep marching ahead.

239
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,905
In order to reach the summit,

240
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:48,284
you will need more corpses.

241
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,426
All right.

242
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:09,555
My guests, you can come out now.

243
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:17,063
Man, this barrel reeks of salted food.

244
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,110
You are a lifesaver, Leif.

245
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,945
We appreciate your kindness.

246
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:27,282
It's not out of kindness.
This is a transaction.

247
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,826
Don't forget your side of the deal.

248
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,830
- I wouldn't transport criminals like you.
- It smells!

249
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,832
Not out of kindness alone.

250
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,461
You don't know how hard it was
to convince my people.

251
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:45,133
Don't worry.
A warrior never goes back on his word.

252
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:47,552
The Ketil Farm will purchase

253
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:51,806
all of your cargo at three times
the standard price.

254
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:54,309
Don't forget about Thorfinn.

255
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:58,855
Of course!
We will hand over that slave too.

256
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:00,440
Right, Dad?

257
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:06,821
Dad! You can come out--

258
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:08,740
Shut up!

259
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,326
Don't talk to me! Leave me alone!

260
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:14,829
Someone's in a bad mood.

261
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,916
Just don't forget about your promise.

262
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:54,786
All right, let's call it a day.

263
00:22:54,786 --> 00:22:56,871
Yeah, I agree.

264
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:58,289
Good work.

265
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:14,889
What's the matter, Thorfinn?

266
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:18,142
Have you never seen a sunset before?

267
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:22,939
It's not that...

268
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:31,614
Laugh at me all you want.

269
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,284
Curse me all you want.

270
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:40,873
Everything is for the sake
of a peaceful world.

271
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:50,466
Everything is for the sake
of the love that was lost.

272
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:39,492
<i>"Dark Clouds."</i>
