1
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:28,607
Einar...

2
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:50,796
W... Wait!

3
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:53,007
Wait!

4
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,783
Damn it!

5
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:23,245
<i>Why am I here?</i>

6
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,919
<i>I can't fall.</i>

7
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:32,963
<i>If I fall down there...</i>

8
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,726
Please stop!

9
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,980
Please!

10
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:08,833
Good morning, Thorfinn.

11
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,545
Seems like your nightmare
was worse than usual.

12
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,385
In my dream

13
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:21,554
I fell from a cliff.

14
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:27,476
- You remember your dream this time?
- A little.

15
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:31,355
You were talking a lot in your sleep.

16
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:35,442
Things like, "Father" and "Askeladd."

17
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,321
Is Askeladd someone's name?

18
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:23,801
<i>No matter</i>

19
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,428
<i>how hard I try,</i>

20
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,306
<i>I can't remember my dream.</i>

21
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:32,810
AN EMPTY MAN

22
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,564
<i>All I know is that
it's a terrifying dream.</i>

23
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,609
<i>Also...</i>

24
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:42,278
<i>I feel...</i>

25
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,866
<i>like I am forgetting
something very important.</i>

26
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,540
<i>It's as if I have a small bone</i>

27
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,916
<i>stuck in my throat.</i>

28
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:01,255
<i>It's terrifying. I want to forget it.</i>

29
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:05,134
<i>But I feel like it's something
I must not forget.</i>

30
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,849
<i>What is it?</i>

31
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,038
Look, their wheat has grown
this much already.

32
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:38,250
Is it because it's newly cleared land
and the soil is fertile?

33
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,253
No, it must be Einar.

34
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:44,798
Ever since he came,
the development has sped up.

35
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,936
Damn it, the master must be
out of his mind.

36
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:02,483
Cultivating a field
is a job meant for respectable men.

37
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,693
Not for wretched slaves.

38
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:08,322
This is not right.

39
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,824
Even if it's the master's orders.

40
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:14,453
If slaves and farmhands
are treated equally,

41
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:17,414
it will disrupt the order within society.

42
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:18,832
Don't you agree?

43
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,384
Askeladd

44
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:33,097
was the man who killed my father.

45
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,851
He was a Dane and a warmonger.

46
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:43,607
He was strong and cruel.

47
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,611
- I'll throw it to you.
- Okay.

48
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:52,741
So he came out in your dream?

49
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:55,661
I don't know.

50
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,041
I followed Askeladd

51
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,252
onto the battlefield.

52
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:07,339
In order to avenge my father.

53
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:09,091
For ten years...

54
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,928
No, for eleven years, I fought.

55
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,016
I hated him.

56
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,186
Enough to want to kill him.

57
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:27,526
So, did you get revenge?

58
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,280
No...

59
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:34,283
Askeladd was

60
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:37,202
killed by another man

61
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:40,289
right in front of my eyes.

62
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,337
Thorfinn, throw me another one.

63
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:48,964
Okay.

64
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,927
There!

65
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:56,305
Well,

66
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,725
I don't know about the details,

67
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,101
but I feel like

68
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:04,313
I understand why
you're in low spirits now.

69
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:09,776
The fact that it comes out in your dreams

70
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:12,404
probably means your heart
hasn't processed it yet.

71
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:15,491
I guess so.

72
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,452
You may be right.

73
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:20,621
But...

74
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:26,710
<i>That's not all... There's something else.</i>

75
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,089
<i>I feel like I'm forgetting about
something more important.</i>

76
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,427
<i>Something very important.</i>

77
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:48,023
Well, I guess it's not something

78
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:50,692
you can just get over that easily.

79
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:53,987
But you know,

80
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:57,824
your vendetta

81
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,159
is over now.

82
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:04,039
Plus, hating someone who's already dead

83
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,582
won't get you anywhere.

84
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,543
Isn't that right?

85
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,506
Stand back, Thorfinn!

86
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,759
Become a true warrior...

87
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:19,471
son of Thors...

88
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:26,019
I don't hate him anymore.

89
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:31,316
That's the problem.

90
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:38,031
Without any hatred I'm...

91
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:42,536
...empty.

92
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:50,460
Hatred is what has kept me alive.

93
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,591
I don't know anything

94
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,718
outside of the battlefield.

95
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:02,222
I don't know how to fix a simple roof.

96
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,349
I can't do anything.

97
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,728
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do.

98
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,065
I'm empty.

99
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,238
Work.

100
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,157
Old Master!

101
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:23,493
If you have time to waste on chitchat,
get some work done!

102
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:27,331
I have more work for you to do today.

103
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:41,511
Ready? Watch carefully.

104
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,239
Try it. Catch ones that are worth eating.

105
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,825
There!

106
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,622
What? It doesn't fan out.

107
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:10,082
Come on!

108
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:14,628
I can't eat meat right now,
since it's Easter.

109
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:17,589
Don't make me survive on wheat
at this old age.

110
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:23,678
Oh, that was great!

111
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:27,099
No, I didn't catch a single fish.

112
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:30,519
Spin it more. Like this!

113
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,812
Like this!

114
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:35,273
Don't throw it into the same area
over and over again.

115
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:36,525
Yes.

116
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,575
It's not too late to start learning things

117
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,702
one by one.

118
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,709
If you're empty,
you have room to put anything inside.

119
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,629
If you're thinking about
starting a new life,

120
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,507
it's actually better to be empty.

121
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:04,386
- What? You were eavesdropping?
- It was loud enough to hear.

122
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:13,478
Do you think I can start a new life?

123
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:18,066
Get to work.
I don't see your hands moving.

124
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:27,451
Man, it's freezing!

125
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,369
It's going to snow for sure!

126
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:33,290
Fishing in this cold is going to be tough.

127
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,127
Although, I do want to redeem myself.

128
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:39,921
After all, the two of us
were only able to catch

129
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:42,883
three small fish and a bunch of shellfish.

130
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:45,135
Right, Thorfinn?

131
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:48,930
Huh? Oh, sorry.

132
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,640
I wasn't listening.

133
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,768
Jeez, were you deep in thought again?

134
00:12:57,022 --> 00:13:00,650
Can humans change?

135
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,612
How can we change?

136
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:07,532
Hey, Thorfinn...

137
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:11,620
You used to be a warrior, right?

138
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,788
Huh? Yeah.

139
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:16,291
Warriors are people who

140
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,920
hold axes, go to war,
pillage, drink alcohol,

141
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,298
and don't give a damn about anything!

142
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:24,799
Right?

143
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:30,222
Well, I guess that sounds about right.

144
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:32,057
I didn't use an axe though.

145
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,770
With the way you are right now,

146
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,398
not a single person will think
you used to be a warrior.

147
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:44,653
You think so?

148
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,197
What do you mean, "You think so?"

149
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:50,200
Look at your reflection on the water

150
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,035
and take a good look at your face.

151
00:13:56,957 --> 00:14:00,502
I am honestly glad that I didn't meet you

152
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:03,004
when you were a warrior.

153
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:07,509
Worst-case scenario,
I may have been killed by you.

154
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,265
Humans can change, Thorfinn.

155
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,267
I think you are

156
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:18,895
currently in the process
of changing for the better.

157
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:33,034
You think so?

158
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,288
Yes.

159
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:42,252
Thank you, Einar.

160
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:49,801
What's wrong? Einar?

161
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:04,399
The wheat!

162
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,719
All of it...

163
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:37,265
Did someone do this?

164
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:39,434
Why?

165
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,606
Wheat is a strong plant.

166
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,151
Even if it's bent a little by wind,

167
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:51,571
it can get back up on its own.

168
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,700
They knew that very well.

169
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,662
They dug them out from the roots.

170
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:08,129
- Hey, where are you...?
- The farmhands.

171
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:11,591
They're the only ones who would do this.

172
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:15,470
Wait, what are you going to do? Einar!

173
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,305
Don't you know?

174
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:19,474
If a slave uses violence
against a free man...

175
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:23,853
I don't care. I'll kill them.

176
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:27,983
Calm down!
We don't have proof that they did it.

177
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:30,485
Even if we confront them, they'll deny it.

178
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:32,237
Stop, Einar.

179
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:34,990
Let's talk to Pater first--

180
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,868
You're so level-headed, Thorfinn.

181
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:42,372
Don't you understand the situation?

182
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:47,961
We used the nutrients in the soil
but have zero harvest.

183
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:52,507
We have to borrow seeds again next time.

184
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:55,719
But more than that,

185
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,512
they... they...

186
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,558
should know the hardships and the joy

187
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:02,767
of growing wheat.

188
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,354
They're farmers as well!

189
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:12,027
How could they do this...?

190
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:14,029
Be angry, Thorfinn.

191
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,532
Our wheat has been destroyed!

192
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:24,873
I...

193
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:29,044
I have always been

194
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:33,631
the one doing the robbing and destroying.

195
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,926
Unlike you,

196
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:39,345
I don't have the right to get mad

197
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:42,182
at the farmhands.

198
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:45,351
If you are

199
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:48,146
going to kill the farmhands,

200
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,356
I deserve to be

201
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:54,235
killed by you at least 100 times.

202
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:07,207
First, please calm down.

203
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,292
Please.

204
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,461
Einar...

205
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:19,969
I see.

206
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:23,973
This is very horrible, indeed.

207
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,391
Neither of you

208
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:28,645
saw anyone in the act
of destroying it, right?

209
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:29,979
That's right.

210
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:32,190
Leave this the way it is

211
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,400
until we finish investigating.

212
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,988
There might be some clues left behind.

213
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,867
So, do you have any guesses
as to who the culprit is?

214
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,580
The farmhands.

215
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:49,999
I see.

216
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:54,170
All right, I will report everything
to the master.

217
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,381
Leave the rest to me.

218
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,803
<i>Back when I was a slave,</i>

219
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:04,139
<i>I also went through horrible experiences.</i>

220
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:07,225
<i>I used to think,</i>

221
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,477
<i>"Why do these people torment me</i>

222
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,355
<i>when it doesn't benefit them in any way?"</i>

223
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:17,026
Wherever you go,
there are people who like to discriminate.

224
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,279
But there are also people who don't.

225
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,949
Don't lose heart, both of you.

226
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:42,844
About Arnheid...

227
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:49,434
Apparently, the master
is very attached to her.

228
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:55,607
Depending on how hard we work,
we can be freed,

229
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,234
but she wasn't offered
that kind of contract.

230
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,447
It seemed

231
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:05,116
like she had given up on becoming free.

232
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:10,580
When you're favored, you become chained.

233
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,416
When you're hated,
you get treated like this.

234
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,295
What kind of...

235
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:21,090
life is this?

236
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,686
I didn't expect it to be so much work.

237
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,189
- I'm exhausted!
- What are you saying?

238
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,607
- You were just watching.
- Yeah!

239
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,776
Let's take another route, Einar.

240
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:41,903
You're always like that.

241
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:44,447
Stop it, Einar!

242
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:46,950
There's no reason for us to shy away.

243
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:53,039
Oh, speak of the devil.

244
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,964
Hey, what's up? Why the long face?

245
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,593
Keep your cool, Einar. Just ignore them.

246
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:16,354
What? Get out of the way.

247
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:21,109
It was you
who destroyed our field, wasn't it?

248
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,444
Huh? Field?

249
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:26,864
I don't know what you're talking about.

250
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:33,162
- Einar!
- Oh, I see.

251
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:35,581
Your field was destroyed, huh?

252
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,625
That's too bad!

253
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,837
But don't be too sad about it.

254
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:46,676
The wheat was made by slaves, anyway.

255
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:50,680
No one would eat something so smelly!

256
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:21,627
Damn...

257
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:29,260
I think his jaw is broken.

258
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,015
That was an awesome punch!

259
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:38,102
- You brat!
- How dare you, slave!

260
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:40,021
I'll kill you!

261
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:45,651
Slave this, slave that... I've had enough!

262
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,653
Stop squealing and bring it on!

263
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,156
Idiot! Don't do anything--

264
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:53,993
Thorfinn! Are you okay?

265
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,289
Let go of me!

266
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:03,503
- Take this!
- You little...

267
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:05,713
Damn it!

268
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:07,465
Stop...

269
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:17,600
<i>What? You...</i>

270
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,102
<i>Why...</i>

271
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:35,368
<i>F... Father?</i>

272
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:41,374
<i>Father is saying something...</i>

273
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:46,045
<i>Oh no...</i>

274
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:49,882
<i>I'm... falling...</i>

275
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,325
<i>"Oath."</i>

276
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:40,910
