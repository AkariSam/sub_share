1
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:01,325
<i>Is this old man hard of hearing too?</i>

2
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,669
Guards, don't think about moving.

3
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:18,175
The king is within my reach.

4
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:24,598
- Seriously?
- No way...

5
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,612
Askeladd...

6
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:42,867
- You bastard! King Sweyn is--
- Don't move, Thorkell!

7
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:46,328
Askeladd is not in his right mind.
Don't provoke him.

8
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:48,497
It will put the king at risk.

9
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,173
Put your sword down.

10
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:01,135
Then I will forgive you
for this impudence.

11
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:05,264
Forgive?
Don't get cocky with me, you barbarian.

12
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:08,058
You deserve to die for insulting

13
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:10,561
my family and my people.

14
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,147
This is my last warning.

15
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:17,067
Put your sword down, Askeladd.

16
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,445
That is my nickname.

17
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:24,033
I will let you know my real name
bestowed upon me by my mother.

18
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:28,746
Lucius Artorius Castus.

19
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,040
I am

20
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,293
the rightful king who was meant to

21
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:35,669
rule over Britannia.

22
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:54,563
<i>That felt good.</i>

23
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:20,714
<i>For a time, Danish forces</i>

24
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:24,134
<i>had taken over hegemony in England.</i>

25
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:25,970
<i>But in 1014,</i>

26
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,681
<i>with the death of King Sweyn of Denmark,</i>

27
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:31,517
<i>the state of affairs changed drastically.</i>

28
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:38,357
<i>Denmark and England</i>

29
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:42,069
<i>took up arms once again.</i>

30
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:45,572
<i>Canute, the head of the English Front</i>

31
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:50,244
<i>of the Danish Vikings,
who succeeded his father's supremacy.</i>

32
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:53,080
<i>Ethelred II, who has returned</i>

33
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,749
<i>from exile in Normandy and was</i>

34
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:58,627
<i>restored to power
after the death of Sweyn.</i>

35
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,966
<i>With both men claiming
to be the King of England,</i>

36
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,467
<i>it once again became</i>

37
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:08,053
<i>uncertain as to who
the throne belonged to.</i>

38
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:13,934
<i>The ravages of war
left England impoverished.</i>

39
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,028
Your Majesty, please stand back!

40
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:27,072
Do not worry. I did not drink from it.

41
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,324
Your Majesty, please have mercy!

42
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,535
In the name of Lord Jesus,

43
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:33,620
I swear I did not know!

44
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,622
I would never poison your drink!

45
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:38,042
Your Majesty, please have mercy!

46
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,793
King Ethelred!

47
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,129
Damn you...

48
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,716
<i>Using cowardly tricks...</i>

49
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,285
My goodness...

50
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,497
this is much worse than
what I had imagined,

51
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:18,290
Your Majesty.

52
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,794
To think that Mercia,
a place once known as

53
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:24,088
"the gem of the Midlands"
looks like this now.

54
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:27,216
It will take a long time
for them to recover.

55
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,804
Gunnar, don't talk as if
it has nothing to do with you.

56
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:34,223
We are the ones who destroyed it.

57
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:38,018
What's that?

58
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,899
Oh, yes... That is

59
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,444
our army's advance party
which took control of this land.

60
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:49,530
- Let go of me!
- I'm not asking about that.

61
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,698
I am asking you what they are doing.

62
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:55,285
Well, they're pillaging, of course.

63
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,287
They're picking out girls they can sell

64
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:58,914
from among the beggars.

65
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,250
I forbade that, didn't I?

66
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:04,545
Behead them
and display them on the streets.

67
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,006
What? However...

68
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:11,218
collecting spoils of war
is customary during wartime.

69
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:13,804
We don't want to overly restrict them...

70
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:17,015
Soldiers who disregard military discipline
are no soldiers of mine.

71
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:19,768
Behead them
and display them on the streets.

72
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:23,814
Okay... Well then...

73
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:26,984
- You there!
- What? Seriously?

74
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,042
Thank you for taking the time

75
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,670
to come all the way here, Your Majesty.

76
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:49,798
Floki, how are the preparations going?

77
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,926
Very well. We are ready any time.

78
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,679
I have them waiting already.

79
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,601
However, there is no reason for
Your Majesty to meet him personally.

80
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,561
You can leave it to us--

81
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:06,190
It's fine. I was going to check up
on the situation here anyway.

82
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,191
I'll meet him.

83
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:10,611
Eadric, the earl of Mercia,
is just a spineless man.

84
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,071
He is not worth meeting.

85
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:16,909
His character and whether or not
he is useful are two different things.

86
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,077
Either way, I will decide once I meet him.

87
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,458
Besides, there is another reason for which

88
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,585
I came all the way over here.

89
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:29,338
What may that be?

90
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,217
Hey!

91
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:37,221
Canute!

92
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,474
There you are, you bastard!

93
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:44,228
Canute!

94
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:47,272
I have to calm that thing down.

95
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,691
I doubt you guys can handle that.

96
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:52,027
That is true...

97
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:05,582
You little punk!

98
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:08,001
Let me punch you! For starters,

99
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:11,338
just shut up and let me punch you!

100
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:13,966
Calm down, Thorkell.

101
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:17,469
Hey, you little...

102
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,765
I hate being stopped
in the middle of a battle,

103
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:25,686
even more than I hate frogs!

104
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,105
Huh? Frogs?

105
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:32,067
Mercia has called for a ceasefire.

106
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,571
The outcome of the battle here is clear.

107
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,948
Good work, Thorkell.

108
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:39,950
Shut your trap!

109
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,953
Once a battle starts,

110
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:47,165
it doesn't end until
you kill the enemy's leader.

111
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:51,712
I was this close
to chopping off Eadric's head!

112
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:55,591
Stop fussing over it.
Earl Eadric of Mercia is nothing

113
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,759
but a lord of a rural territory.

114
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,970
Take a look at the big picture.

115
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,599
I don't care about that!

116
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:07,477
All I care about is
living a fulfilling war-centered life.

117
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,396
In the east,

118
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:13,358
Ethelred's son Edmund
is showing some suspicious activity.

119
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:17,362
We ask for your assistance
in suppressing the eastern front.

120
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:18,780
Your outstanding--

121
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,701
I will choose who and where to fight!

122
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,328
You dice-head!

123
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:26,747
Canute!

124
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,916
You better not have forgotten

125
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,502
about that time when I told you,

126
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:35,964
<i>"I will be a witness to</i>

127
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,008
<i>what you will accomplish</i>

128
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:41,094
<i>and who you will become from now on."</i>

129
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:45,307
You are still a nobody.

130
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:47,768
You're not even the king of England yet.

131
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:50,437
You're nothing but a kid.

132
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,898
Listen up, kid...

133
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:57,235
It is impossible
for you to avoid fighting.

134
00:10:57,235 --> 00:11:00,655
You have no choice but to
pave your path with blood and iron.

135
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:04,159
Just as Askeladd did.

136
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,161
Don't forget that.

137
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:08,455
From the moment you started walking

138
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,499
your path has been covered in blood.

139
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,294
Get off already!

140
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,797
Enough of that! Scram!

141
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:19,508
How annoying!

142
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:22,594
I'll go easy on you for today.

143
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:25,597
But there will be no next time.
Don't forget that.

144
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:30,685
How could he insult you
in front of the army!

145
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,271
Your Majesty, he has gone too far!

146
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,440
This must not be overlooked!

147
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,985
Why? He has a point.

148
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:40,695
It was a valuable warning.

149
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,907
He has nothing to hide.

150
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:47,327
It must feel great
to be able to live like him.

151
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,915
Let's go.

152
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,816
It's worth 4,000 pounds in silver.

153
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:21,319
This is everything we could
collect at the moment.

154
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:24,197
Please accept it.

155
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:32,706
If you pull your troops out of Mercia

156
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:35,750
we will offer an additional 4,000.

157
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,171
It's not a bad deal, Lord Canute.

158
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:42,382
So this is Danegeld?

159
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:44,593
Lord Eadric...

160
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:52,601
What do you say, Lord Canute?

161
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:08,867
How cheap.

162
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:25,383
All right, raise it up just like that.

163
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:14,808
I will ask you again.

164
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,436
Are you saying you will pay

165
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:22,524
this gold and silver in the hope
that I will retreat from Mercia,

166
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,359
Eadric?

167
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,320
It's 8,000 pounds!

168
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,282
It should be more than sufficient
as compensation.

169
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:33,618
It's insufficient.

170
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:37,914
Think about what you are saying.

171
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:39,791
You are telling me,

172
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,419
Canute, the Bretwalda of England,

173
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:46,590
to leave your territory
in exchange for money.

174
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:49,968
And the price you pay
for disrespecting the king

175
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:51,678
is this meager amount?

176
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:57,475
I am your king.

177
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,645
I came here to suppress a rebellion

178
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:02,647
occurring within my own land.

179
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,775
Not to ask for money.

180
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,322
What nonsense!

181
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:15,243
Our ruler is none other than King Ethelred
of the royal House of Wessex!

182
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:16,453
It's certainly not you!

183
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:17,954
Stop that!

184
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:20,373
- But Father--
- No!

185
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,626
This is not the time
nor the place for that!

186
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,544
Now that you mention it,

187
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:27,923
there is another person
who claims to be the King of England.

188
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:30,759
So?

189
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,596
Did Ethelred approve of you
making this deal?

190
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,516
If he learns of our situation

191
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:41,227
His Majesty will surely understand.

192
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:45,231
Really? How kind of him.

193
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,610
Even if his subject
abandons the battlefront

194
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,571
without permission
for the sake of his own territory,

195
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,573
Ethelred will be forgiving, huh?

196
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,244
He's so mean.

197
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,372
How cruel...

198
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,460
There is no order
because there are two kings.

199
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:11,383
One must die.

200
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:17,013
Ethelred is a coward who deserted
his people and the throne

201
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:20,517
and went into exile
during the previous battle.

202
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,978
Putting the future of England

203
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:25,438
in the hands
of a man like that is foolish,

204
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:27,107
don't you think?

205
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:31,820
Are you telling me to...

206
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,405
betray him?

207
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:39,411
You have already betrayed him.

208
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:45,917
I can use your help, Eadric.

209
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,009
I want to get rid of Ethelred.

210
00:16:57,387 --> 00:17:01,057
As someone who has
served him for many years,

211
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:02,934
you must know of a good way.

212
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,439
You think...

213
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,859
you can rob me
of my last remaining loyalty?

214
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,277
You punk!

215
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,488
In return, I won't take Mercia.

216
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:18,033
The price is Ethelred's head.

217
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,702
It's quite a bargain.

218
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,538
I refuse!

219
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:26,249
This ceasefire negotiation has failed.

220
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:30,211
I will fight you to the bitter end,
you despicable man!

221
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:40,180
Floki, it seems this man
isn't so spineless after all.

222
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,806
He has quite the backbone.

223
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:43,892
Well...

224
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:47,937
Why not test it out, Your Majesty?

225
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:53,485
Let's go outside, Lord Eadric.

226
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:56,571
There is something I want to show you.

227
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:45,537
- Is it ready?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

228
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:48,623
Do it.

229
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,432
A fire beacon? What is it signaling?

230
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:12,814
What... is this?

231
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:19,237
What is the meaning of this? Canute!

232
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:34,711
Father!

233
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:38,882
Look...

234
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,229
Over there too!

235
00:19:58,776 --> 00:19:59,652
Canute!

236
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:02,947
What is this signaling?!

237
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:09,913
This is what it means to fight me.

238
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,584
Imagine it, Eadric.

239
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,170
At this very moment,

240
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,965
Mercia was reduced to ashes.

241
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:37,899
Do you understand now?

242
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,568
If I wanted to,

243
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:44,280
I could easily set all of you to flames.

244
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:52,705
Father!

245
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,258
Offer up Ethelred's head
and buy yourself peace.

246
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,593
That is the smart decision.

247
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:37,166
<i>The following year, in April 1016,</i>

248
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:41,713
<i>King Ethelred II of England dies.</i>

249
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,430
Your Majesty!

250
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:54,559
<i>It is said to be due to an illness.</i>

251
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:05,528
<i>After Ethelred's death,</i>

252
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:08,865
<i>his son, Edmund, succeeds the throne.</i>

253
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:12,368
<i>Edmund takes over Ethelred</i>

254
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:15,872
<i>and puts up a good fight against
Canute's army, inflicting major damage.</i>

255
00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:24,464
<i>But seven months later,
in November of that same year,</i>

256
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:27,341
<i>he also dies of an illness.</i>

257
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,148
An illness, huh?

258
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,027
Even King Sweyn spent ten years
fighting over this country,

259
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:49,030
but it was all settled
in just three years.

260
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:51,824
The witenagemot said

261
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:55,453
they accept Canute as Bretwalda.

262
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:58,664
His coronation will be next year.

263
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:07,882
Don't talk about Canute.
It ruins my appetite.

264
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:13,429
All right...

265
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:30,071
<i>Sweyn,</i>

266
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:32,365
<i>Ethelred,</i>

267
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:34,617
<i>Edmund...</i>

268
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:39,080
<i>As a result of
the unnatural deaths of his rivals,</i>

269
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,916
<i>in 1018, Canute is</i>

270
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,795
<i>officially crowned King of England.</i>

271
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,283
<i>"I want a horse."</i>

272
00:25:39,283 --> 00:25:40,743
