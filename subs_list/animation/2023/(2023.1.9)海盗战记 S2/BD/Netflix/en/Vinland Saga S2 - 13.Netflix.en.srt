1
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,184
I'm sorry! I apologize!

2
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:49,522
I apologize for everything
I did up until now.

3
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:51,232
Please, forgive me!

4
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,569
I will free you.

5
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,571
I swear to Odin.

6
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:01,575
Money... I'll give you money too.
As much as you want.

7
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:07,081
Not enough...

8
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,501
That's not nearly enough

9
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,129
to make up for the humiliation

10
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,965
I've experienced up until this day.

11
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:21,095
For once, see what it's like
to be a slave yourself.

12
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:23,347
Otherwise,

13
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:26,600
you will never understand
the depth of my anger.

14
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,398
All right!

15
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,403
I will become your slave.

16
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:39,321
I'll serve you.

17
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,576
From today, you are the master

18
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,703
and I'm the slave.

19
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:50,291
Please spare my life, Master.

20
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,422
Is that so...

21
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:58,799
You'll become my slave?

22
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:03,220
Yes, gladly!

23
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,351
Well then,

24
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:12,313
whether I spare you or kill you,

25
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,109
I can do whatever I like.

26
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,261
That was long...

27
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:49,725
Now then, it's time for a reunion.

28
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,671
To think that

29
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:47,760
we won't have to go to Mr. Sverkel's place
to borrow his horse anymore...

30
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:52,556
What's wrong? Why the long face?

31
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,475
Well...

32
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:58,020
Have you already decided?

33
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,938
Huh? Decided what?

34
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:03,442
I mean, once we're free.

35
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:05,319
What do you plan on doing?

36
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,946
Oh, that...

37
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:13,619
You two! Once you are freed,

38
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:17,122
would you like to stay here
and work as farmhands?

39
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:21,460
Hardworking people like you two
are always welcome.

40
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:27,424
That was a nice offer from the master but...

41
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:29,134
What to do...

42
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,846
I've been a slave for too long.

43
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,516
Who knew I'd be so indecisive
the moment I was able to

44
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:37,226
make my own decisions.

45
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,686
That's surprising.

46
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:42,815
So staying here is actually

47
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:44,775
a viable option for you?

48
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:51,198
It's true that I don't
get along with the farmhands.

49
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,244
But if I stay here,

50
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,248
there might come a time
when Arnheid can get her

51
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:00,582
freedom too.

52
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:04,711
I'm so surprised.

53
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,339
You like her that much?

54
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,925
Oh, stop! That's not what this is about.

55
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:13,929
I just...

56
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:17,933
You're late, Gramps!

57
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,560
Are you trying to kill me?

58
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,320
Where's Gramps? He's not with you?

59
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,615
Huh? Oh...

60
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:37,077
The old master hasn't returned?

61
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:39,663
Not since he left
for the field this morning.

62
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:44,293
Damn it!

63
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:47,296
It's already time for dinner.

64
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,883
He asked us to split the firewood, but...

65
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:52,468
That's strange.

66
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:55,929
By this time he's usually--

67
00:07:56,513 --> 00:08:00,225
I didn't eat anything for lunch either!
Damn you, Gramps!

68
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,602
What if I die...?

69
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:09,526
Where are you going?

70
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,779
The field! Follow me!

71
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:15,032
The field?

72
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:38,472
Gramps!

73
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:42,267
Hey, Gramps!

74
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,228
Come on!

75
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:45,938
Gramps!

76
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:30,148
I'm going to die

77
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:32,317
on the bed and not the field, huh?

78
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,529
Me, of all people...

79
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:44,788
It's open. Just come in.

80
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,421
Excuse me.

81
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,049
Um, the mistress

82
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:58,969
ordered me to come here.

83
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:09,479
W... Wow!

84
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:12,482
We get

85
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:15,777
to eat this too, Arnheid?

86
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:18,238
Yes.

87
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:22,743
The old master said that
I can make enough for all of you.

88
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:25,120
I hope you like it.

89
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:30,500
I guess no one prays here...

90
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,586
So delicious!

91
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:35,589
Please eat, Old Master.

92
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,507
Delicious!

93
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:41,094
From today,
I will be here to look after your needs.

94
00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:43,639
Please ask me for anything.

95
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,557
Try this too!

96
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:49,102
Will you be staying at my house overnight?

97
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:53,231
Yes. That is what
the mistress has ordered.

98
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,109
Okay, here you go.

99
00:10:56,735 --> 00:10:58,945
If it doesn't suit your taste,

100
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:00,489
please let me know.

101
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:02,949
That's good.

102
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,869
I don't want it. I'll eat later.

103
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,663
I'm not hungry right now.

104
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,417
I see...

105
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,130
Don't mind him.
Just stuff the spoon into his mouth.

106
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,590
What?

107
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,678
Gramps is too embarrassed to say, "aah."

108
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:25,806
Get used to it, Gramps.

109
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,766
You have no choice but to

110
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:31,228
say "aah" and have them spoon-feed you
until you recover.

111
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:34,523
Did you just laugh?

112
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,983
Uh, no...

113
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:40,404
I'm really not hungry.

114
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:41,655
I'll eat later--

115
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:59,923
I'm kicking all of you out!

116
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:12,894
I'll wash the dishes.

117
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,021
No, I'll do it.

118
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:20,986
I'm glad.

119
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:24,406
The old master seems to be doing better
than I was told.

120
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:27,200
And he doesn't seem to be

121
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,536
as scary as he's rumored to be.

122
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:33,457
Yes. Despite his looks, he's kindhearted.

123
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,292
Although he can be scary sometimes.

124
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,671
I can kind of see that.

125
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:43,758
But...

126
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,683
Honestly,

127
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:54,644
it's been so long since the last time

128
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:57,105
I had so much fun while eating a meal.

129
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:58,440
Me too.

130
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,487
It kind of

131
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:06,740
reminded me of what it was like
when I was free.

132
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:14,789
I agree. Really...

133
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,101
Hey, Slave!

134
00:13:36,144 --> 00:13:37,812
Is Snake here?

135
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:41,816
A runaway slave?

136
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,027
Yes.

137
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:47,239
Supposedly,
three days ago from Kjallakr's farm.

138
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,868
Kjallakr, huh.

139
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:56,331
He always treated his slaves badly.

140
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,874
He got what he deserved.

141
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,128
Well, it's not that simple.

142
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:06,716
That slave killed Kjallakr
and all his sons

143
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:08,009
and set fire to their house.

144
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:12,138
He's ferocious and very skilled.

145
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:21,857
Kjallakr's uncle is offering three horses
to whoever catches him.

146
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:23,692
What do you want to do, Boss?

147
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:27,571
Putting aside the three horses,

148
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:30,031
we should still be a little cautious.

149
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:34,870
You guys, starting from today,
patrol the area

150
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,664
in groups of three for the time being.

151
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:41,084
<i>Even if you find him,</i>

152
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:43,295
<i>don't go out of your way to catch him.</i>

153
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:46,214
<i>First, call for backup.</i>

154
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,928
<i>When a person is backed up against a wall</i>

155
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:55,015
<i>you never know what they will do.</i>

156
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:44,439
Look, that's it.

157
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:48,526
That reflection was coming from
the decoration on the sword.

158
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:51,071
What's up with him?

159
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,739
Is he sleeping?

160
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,157
Seems like it.

161
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:58,203
At first glance he looks like
a beggar or pilgrim.

162
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:00,372
Isn't he pretty suspicious?

163
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:02,707
Very suspicious.

164
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,878
More like,
lower your voices a little more.

165
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,546
So he must be

166
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:10,757
the one who's worth three horses.

167
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:13,051
There's no doubt about it.

168
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:14,260
Hey!

169
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,638
Luck is on our side!

170
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:19,516
- Idiot! It's not that easy.
- Hey!

171
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:22,060
- Whisper!
- I heard he's pretty strong.

172
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,895
It'll be fine!

173
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,856
- We can attack him in his sleep.
- Whisper!

174
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:29,609
We should call for backup, like Boss said.

175
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,112
Don't be a coward, Lizard!

176
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:34,823
If we call for backup,
we'll have to share our reward.

177
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:38,243
I'm telling you guys to whisper!

178
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,370
You don't even know his level of skill.

179
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,122
Where do you get that confidence?

180
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:43,957
The reward is three horses.

181
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:46,459
Right now, we can get one horse each.

182
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,503
That's what I'm talking about.

183
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:50,588
Things don't work out that perfectly!

184
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:53,008
- Whisper!
- Just cut up the horses

185
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:55,343
and eat a leg or two, you fatso!

186
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:56,511
Excuse me, you midget?

187
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:58,722
If you want to die that badly, go alone!

188
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,932
I'll kill you first!

189
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:05,437
- Right back at you!
- Whisper, you idiots!

190
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:38,553
Man, it's hot.

191
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,572
Thorfinn, I've chopped
quite a bit of wood.

192
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:59,616
Can you pile it up?

193
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,287
Hey, Thorfinn!

194
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:10,001
Sorry, just a little bit more.

195
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:13,880
All right.

196
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,176
What is Thorfinn doing?

197
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:22,597
Oh, Snake is inside and reading the Bible.

198
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:25,308
So he's eavesdropping.

199
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:27,936
It's for the old master, who can't read.

200
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:32,816
I see. I didn't know
Thorfinn was a Christian too.

201
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:36,027
Actually, he's not.

202
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:38,863
But apparently,
it's interesting to listen to.

203
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:45,745
"You heard that it was said:

204
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:47,539
'You must love your neighbor

205
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,709
and hate your enemy.'

206
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,921
However, I say to you:

207
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:56,339
Continue to love your enemies

208
00:18:57,006 --> 00:19:00,718
and to pray for those who persecute you,

209
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:05,723
so that you may prove yourselves
sons of your Father who is in the heavens,

210
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,935
since he makes his sun rise on both

211
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:11,229
the wicked and the good

212
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:15,358
and makes it rain on both the righteous

213
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:18,486
and the unrighteous.

214
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:23,449
For, if you love those loving you,

215
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,786
what reward do you have?

216
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:34,252
Are not also the tax collectors
doing the same thing?

217
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:38,256
And if you greet your brothers only,

218
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:41,342
what extraordinary thing are you doing?

219
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:44,220
Are not also the people

220
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,265
of the nations doing the same thing?

221
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:50,101
You must accordingly

222
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,395
be perfect,

223
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:56,065
as your heavenly Father is perfect."

224
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,401
Is that so...

225
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:01,988
Jeez, that's asking a lot.

226
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:05,742
Gramps, I'm tired of the Gospels.

227
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:07,493
Let's read the beginning.

228
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:09,746
It's more interesting than this.

229
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:15,126
Hey, Gramps. What are you doing?

230
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,753
You need the bathroom?

231
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:19,881
B... Barley...

232
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,342
I have to

233
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,427
harvest the barley.

234
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:28,264
Remember I told you,

235
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:30,558
we finished that a while ago.

236
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,060
Just go to sleep.

237
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,065
Arnheid!

238
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:40,276
Gramps wet himself.
Can you take care of it?

239
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:41,277
All right!

240
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:44,864
Oh, I'll help too.

241
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:55,291
Gramps is going senile.

242
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,670
I bet he doesn't have much time left.

243
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:00,546
- What?
- What?

244
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,298
No way...

245
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:06,427
He's well enough
to be out in the field every day.

246
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:10,056
That's right. He even goes fishing
two to three times a day.

247
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,142
But he's old enough to have grandchildren.

248
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:16,813
Old people deteriorate the moment
their legs give out.

249
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:21,025
That being said, it won't be that soon.

250
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,987
He's taken good care of you guys,
so make sure

251
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:26,030
to return the favor while you can.

252
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:33,288
Um, I've always been curious.

253
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:36,040
What is the connection between

254
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,126
you and the old master?

255
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,006
Huh? It's not like we have
any special connection.

256
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:46,342
I just want to take that book

257
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:50,096
and sell it once Gramps dies, that's all.

258
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,645
All right, get back to work.

259
00:21:57,645 --> 00:21:59,147
The sun is almost setting.

260
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:49,322
He's going fast. Is it one of my men?

261
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:52,825
No, it's not.

262
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,703
Hey, you there! Stop!

263
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,082
Boss!

264
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,001
It's him!

265
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,337
He's the runaway slave!

266
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:07,131
He killed Lizard!

267
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:08,841
Please catch him!

268
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:11,719
What? Are you serious? Damn it!

269
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,097
My sword is in the house.

270
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,058
No way...

271
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,110
Gardar!

272
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:42,959
Arnheid!

273
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:51,008
I finally found you!

274
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:53,928
My wife!

275
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:38,950
<i>"Freedom."</i>
