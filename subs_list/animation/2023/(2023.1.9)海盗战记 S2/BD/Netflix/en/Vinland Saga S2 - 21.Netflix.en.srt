1
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,721
- Is that the last one?
- Yes.

2
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:25,855
I doubt Ketil's side has any will
to continue fighting.

3
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:29,984
I will send another messenger
to urge them to surrender.

4
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:31,819
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:37,324
May we seize the houses on the farm?

6
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:41,912
My soldiers do not like
camping out in tents.

7
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:42,997
You may not.

8
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:47,585
I forbid anyone from stepping foot
on the farm.

9
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,213
Once the soldiers get in,
they will begin pillaging.

10
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:54,717
Pillaging is a right given to the victors.

11
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:59,430
The purpose of this battle
is the requisition of the entire farm.

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,098
Not pillaging.

13
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:07,563
I will give the Jomsvikings
a generous reward myself.

14
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:11,901
As you wish.

15
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,626
Isn't it a little too late
to show mercy, Canute?

16
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:36,217
You are doing the right thing.
This is the job of a king.

17
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,389
For the sake of the bigger purpose,
you must save those you must save

18
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:45,309
and kill those you must kill.

19
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:49,188
Common people cannot shoulder this burden.

20
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:55,528
I am still in hell,
far away from paradise.

21
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:59,448
Hell has its own laws.

22
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,618
Canute,

23
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:08,040
you killed your father,
you killed your brother,

24
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,752
and you will have to
continue killing until

25
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:15,089
the trail of corpses reaches paradise.

26
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,548
Thank you, Einar

27
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,634
and Thorfinn.

28
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:04,305
Thank you.

29
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:15,352
Hold him down.

30
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,793
Hold him down tightly!

31
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,796
- He's already dead!
- Pass me the hot water!

32
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:45,090
Just kill me!

33
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,301
Young master...

34
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:52,723
Young master...

35
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:58,896
Dad's hands

36
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,982
are gone.

37
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,368
Young master...

38
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,830
My daughter and my family...

39
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,291
Please...

40
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:32,554
You can't

41
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,475
even slice a pig!

42
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,734
Young master?

43
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,743
Young master!

44
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,293
Are you okay, young master?

45
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:06,255
Are you hurt somewhere too?

46
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,008
Your stomach?

47
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,219
Does your stomach hurt?

48
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,056
You should lie down.

49
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,073
We just received
a second summons to surrender.

50
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:37,744
We can call a truce only if
the entire Ketil family surrenders.

51
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:41,582
The punishment of outlawry
has not changed.

52
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:48,172
Choose whether to continue fighting
or to surrender.

53
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,632
That's ridiculous!

54
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:54,595
I am not going to be
banished from this country!

55
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,890
Do you expect me to leave this land
and become a beggar?

56
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,394
Snake, all of this is happening
because you were incompetent.

57
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,398
You freeloader!

58
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:12,654
- Boss! You old hag...
- Stop, Fox.

59
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:18,285
If we say that we'll continue fighting,
what will you do, Snake?

60
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,039
I'll stick around.

61
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,668
That's what I want to hear!

62
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:30,422
Don't worry, Mother. Leave it up to me.

63
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:35,552
Twenty people is enough to kill the king.

64
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:40,933
When you beat a larger army
with a small force,

65
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,310
that's when a man really shines!

66
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,188
Calm down, Thorgil.

67
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,525
You are not the one
who gets to make that decision.

68
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,819
Of course it's me.

69
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:57,950
Dad is unconscious.
Or did you want to make the decision?

70
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,536
It's not me either.

71
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:06,583
As the head of the family,
Ketil has chosen an heir.

72
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,237
Surrender.

73
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:39,157
What are you saying, child?

74
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:42,077
You should be ashamed as a Nordic man!

75
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,835
I'm ashamed.

76
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:52,212
I'm ashamed but...

77
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:55,716
I'm scared.

78
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:59,052
I'm scared.

79
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:04,224
I'm scared of seeing others die
and scared of dying myself.

80
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,603
I don't care if we're banished.

81
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:09,605
I just want

82
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,232
to end all of this.

83
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:19,573
Don't be ridiculous, Olmar.
You wanted to go to war.

84
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:22,868
You started this battle
in the first place.

85
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:26,830
That's right. It's my fault.

86
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:33,086
I messed up and was ridiculed
and lost my temper and was full of myself.

87
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,841
I'm sorry I did this to all of you.

88
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,719
But because I started this,

89
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:44,306
I want to be the one to end this.

90
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:51,480
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

91
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:55,776
They had their eyes on this farm
from the beginning.

92
00:10:56,735 --> 00:11:00,697
But I gave them the opportunity
to start a war.

93
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:06,495
They can find any reason
to start a war regardless.

94
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:09,247
If it hadn't been you,
they would've used me or Dad.

95
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,626
You protected your honor back there.

96
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:18,256
Right, Olmar? You did good.
Honor is more important than life.

97
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:23,553
Show your courage
as a Nordic warrior once more.

98
00:11:24,846 --> 00:11:25,889
No!

99
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,854
That wasn't courage at all!

100
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,651
<i>I messed up in front of the king.</i>

101
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:42,197
<i>I'm a stupid, useless man
who deserves to be laughed at.</i>

102
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:44,199
<i>And yet...</i>

103
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,370
And yet...

104
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:54,626
I didn't have the courage

105
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:58,088
to let people laugh at me.

106
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:10,434
I can't become like you.

107
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:14,020
I don't care about the honor
of a Nordic warrior.

108
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:18,358
I will surrender.

109
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,319
Laugh if you want to.

110
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,210
The acting family head
has made a decision.

111
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,299
Olmar, go and tell King Canute
your decision.

112
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:49,514
I will go with you.

113
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:59,149
I won't laugh, young master.

114
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:06,072
I'm over this.

115
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,951
Move out of my way.

116
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:15,582
- Wait! Where are you going, Thorgil?
- Shut up.

117
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,543
Bye, you cowards.

118
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:39,189
It may be true that your power
has supported many people.

119
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,611
But I'm sure you have seen
with your own eyes,

120
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:51,451
what happens to those who become
obsessed with wealth and power.

121
00:13:56,373 --> 00:14:00,544
But it's not like you are
losing everything for nothing.

122
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:05,215
In exchange for the farm,

123
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:09,886
your son has become a real man.

124
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,398
<i>Why?</i>

125
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,900
Why did you let him go?

126
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:28,780
You have been searching for Thorfinn
this whole time, right?

127
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,702
You came all the way here to take
Thorfinn back to your homeland, right?

128
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:39,457
That is true. That vow I made

129
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:42,502
has been my reason to live up until now.

130
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:48,258
No matter how many times I lost
sight of it, I kept searching.

131
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:53,513
I cannot break my vow to my friend.

132
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,186
But right now, something much bigger
is moving Thorfinn to take action.

133
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:04,733
And he told me that he will return.

134
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:09,404
I will trust that look in his eyes.

135
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:14,910
Thorfinn!

136
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:45,982
So you're not a member
of the Ketil family?

137
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,445
My name is Thorfinn, son of Thors.

138
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:53,490
I work as a hand on this farm.

139
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,118
I am here on behalf of Ketil.

140
00:15:57,994 --> 00:15:59,746
Please let me speak with the king.

141
00:16:00,622 --> 00:16:03,500
A hand? You're a slave, aren't you?

142
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:08,713
I can tell who's a slave right away.

143
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:11,758
Because they smell like livestock.

144
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:21,017
You're out of the question.

145
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:25,522
If the Ketil family doesn't surrender,
we'll just continue the battle.

146
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,652
I am acquainted with the king.

147
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:33,697
If you tell him my name, he should know.

148
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,993
Please tell him that Thorfinn,
son of Thors, is here.

149
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,462
You and King Canute are acquaintances?

150
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:54,384
About four years ago,
although it was for a short time,

151
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,845
I served as the king's royal guard.

152
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:12,027
Did that wake you up, midget?

153
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,948
As if someone as smelly and tiny as you
could be a royal guard!

154
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:22,746
I apologize if I offended you.
But it is true.

155
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:25,248
Please tell the king my name.

156
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,625
Please.

157
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,922
What happened, Drott?
That didn't wake him up at all!

158
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:35,759
Seems like your punch was too weak.

159
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:39,888
You're not a morning person, huh?

160
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,307
So you want me to wake you up

161
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:45,685
like your kind little mommy?

162
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:50,690
Do it!

163
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,193
Come on!

164
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:56,988
Did you figure out what the fuss is about?

165
00:17:56,988 --> 00:18:00,700
Yes, Ketil has sent over a messenger.

166
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:03,745
But it is not Ketil himself,

167
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:06,039
so my men are trying to send him back,

168
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:09,459
but it seems he is very resilient.

169
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:13,963
- Did you get his name and status?
- Yes.

170
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:19,719
He works as a hand on the farm
and is named Thorfinn, son of Thors.

171
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:28,103
Is he a young

172
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,313
and small man?

173
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:33,024
Yes, exactly.

174
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:35,735
Do you know him?

175
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:40,782
Do it!

176
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:47,539
What shall we do, Your Majesty?
Would you like to meet him?

177
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,878
No, there is no need for that.

178
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,511
<i>Son of Thors...</i>

179
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:03,680
<i>There's no way...</i>

180
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:07,308
- Get him!
- Fight back, midget!

181
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:08,643
Aim for his eyes!

182
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:13,106
Wait a second! I don't want to fight you.

183
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:19,404
Wow, he's pretty agile!

184
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,034
What's wrong, Drott?

185
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:27,495
- You're not hitting him at all!
- Get it together!

186
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:32,417
<i>Damn it! I was too naïve.</i>

187
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,003
<i>Anyway, I have to get out of
this situation.</i>

188
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:39,048
Hurry up and get a punch in, Drott!

189
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:41,301
The bet is going nowhere.

190
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:49,934
- Yeah!
- One down!

191
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,937
- Go!
- He's still perfectly fine!

192
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,940
- Kill him!
- Damn it!

193
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:00,361
- Thorfinn! Are you okay?
- Einar...

194
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:02,238
Why are you here?

195
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:05,950
Idiot! Obviously, I'm here to stop you!

196
00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:08,995
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,001
Just get up already.
Let's hurry up and run.

198
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:18,296
There's no point in talking to these guys.

199
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:20,632
All right, pay up.

200
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:24,302
Thank you.

201
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:28,389
Thorfinn.

202
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:31,392
What kind of bet is that?

203
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,937
Huh? Oh...

204
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:38,358
We're betting on how many punches
it'll take until you run off crying.

205
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:40,902
Including whether you die
or get knocked out.

206
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:44,405
The most popular bet is under ten punches.

207
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:47,784
A few have put their bet on
more than 20 punches.

208
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,370
Come on, you can do it.

209
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,039
- Just one more punch.
- Endure ten more!

210
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,042
Unbelievable!

211
00:20:57,752 --> 00:20:58,795
That bet...

212
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,339
I will join too.

213
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,050
I'll bet on myself.

214
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:09,555
Even if I win, I don't need the money.

215
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:10,807
In return,

216
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:15,645
you will let me speak with the king.

217
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:22,277
Did you hear that?

218
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:24,946
That midget just said something
really interesting.

219
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:29,534
All right, why not? You've got guts.

220
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:33,788
But I won't let you bet
on under ten punches.

221
00:21:35,707 --> 00:21:38,001
What has nobody bet on yet?

222
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:39,752
Let's see...

223
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:42,964
There are bets all the way up to 90.

224
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:46,843
Then 100 punches it is.

225
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:49,846
If you endure 100 punches, you win.

226
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,850
If you lose, we will take your life.

227
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:57,812
- Very well.
- Hey!

228
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:02,442
Thorfinn! Why would you go

229
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:05,069
that far just for Ketil?

230
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:08,031
This is war.

231
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:10,283
A single person can't do
anything about it.

232
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:14,704
If they want to fight,
just let them fight amongst themselves.

233
00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:18,708
I...

234
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:22,086
am glad that

235
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:25,214
I ended up on this farm.

236
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:29,761
<i>I didn't know anything other than war,</i>

237
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:32,764
<i>but the master, Pater,</i>

238
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:34,599
<i>and the old master</i>

239
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,768
<i>didn't give up on me.</i>

240
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:38,936
<i>They were good to me.</i>

241
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:42,732
<i>I even got to meet you.</i>

242
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,447
I know you agree with me, deep down.

243
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:52,325
Are you okay with never

244
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:55,995
being able to pay back the kindness
you were shown?

245
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:05,004
- Thorfinn...
- It's fine, Einar.

246
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,050
There's a trick to being punched.

247
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:12,678
I am used to being punched.

248
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:16,849
- Are you serious?
- Way to go!

249
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:19,185
Take down that blockhead!

250
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,397
He's making a fool out of you, Drott!

251
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,150
Are you all show?

252
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:28,861
Just squash him already!

253
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,199
I, Drott the Bear Killer,

254
00:23:33,783 --> 00:23:36,911
have never been humiliated
like this before!

255
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,915
I will kill you.

256
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:44,627
Is he stupid? He's going to die!

257
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:47,046
Try to last until 20 punches!

258
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:48,589
Get him!

259
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:39,033
<i>"Emperor of Rebellion."</i>

260
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,910
