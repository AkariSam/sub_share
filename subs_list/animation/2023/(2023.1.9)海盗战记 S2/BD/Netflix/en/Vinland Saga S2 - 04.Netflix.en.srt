1
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:23,978
Next, it'll be your eye.

2
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:26,480
Be afraid.

3
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:28,983
Stop, Fox!

4
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:38,117
Snake?

5
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,249
How terrible.

6
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:50,129
Boss... welcome back. When did you...?

7
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,465
Fox.

8
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,050
Yes, sir!

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,845
- Come here.
- Yes, sir!

10
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:10,566
- Badger.
- Yes, sir!

11
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,109
Explain!

12
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,906
Yes, sir!

13
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:22,036
You idiots.

14
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,833
You guys are idiots.

15
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,213
Why are you guys bullying the slaves?

16
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,673
The young master is the one
who should be doing that.

17
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:38,677
But... it's because this guy...

18
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:42,389
was giving us attitude.

19
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:01,408
Sorry about that.

20
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:03,786
These guys are just stupid.

21
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:07,498
I'm Snake.

22
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:10,668
I'm Thorfinn.

23
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:00,426
You see, Thorfinn?

24
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:04,930
Your body is telling you
that it wants to live.

25
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:17,943
I'm going to sleep.
You guys, kindly send those three back.

26
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:19,570
- Huh?
- Oh...

27
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:23,240
I hope you know...

28
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:28,662
If you cause any more trouble
regarding this case,

29
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:31,749
you guys will never

30
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,586
be able to eat using your jaws ever again.

31
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:41,217
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

32
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:47,973
Thorfinn...

33
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:49,975
You...

34
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:55,481
I want to live?

35
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:02,696
Live...

36
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:08,744
Live...

37
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:10,663
to do what?

38
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,359
Aside from your ear,

39
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,445
your wounds seem pretty shallow.

40
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:10,074
They should heal well.

41
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,914
I'm sorry you two had to go through that.

42
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:19,458
The master is also having a hard time

43
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:23,128
trying to handle those guests
and their pranks.

44
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:24,963
Pranks?

45
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:27,841
We were almost killed
because of their "prank."

46
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:32,429
Oh, they wouldn't actually kill you.

47
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:34,890
No...

48
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,352
If that Snake or whatever hadn't come,

49
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:40,521
we really would've been killed.

50
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,857
To people like them,

51
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:48,695
our lives are not worth a damn!

52
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,991
It can't be helped.

53
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:58,497
The strong ones kill the weak ones.

54
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,458
That is only natural.

55
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,962
What did you say?

56
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:08,424
- You--
- Calm down, Einar.

57
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,219
If they ever bother you again,

58
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,847
don't follow them.
Come and tell me instead.

59
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,101
More importantly,
we don't want your wound to fester.

60
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,477
Let me put medicine on it.

61
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,729
Medicine?

62
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,150
Pater, we...

63
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,361
Don't worry about
the cost of the medicine.

64
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:33,699
I am in charge of taking care of you guys.

65
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:38,328
I'm sorry I got there so late.

66
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:42,124
No...

67
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,169
Thank you very much.

68
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,757
You should thank Arnheid too.

69
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:56,430
She searched the fields up and down
in order to notify me.

70
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,023
Rest for today, you two.

71
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:09,234
I will explain to the master.

72
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,360
Also...

73
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:14,031
This is my old shirt,
so it may be a little big,

74
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,866
but you can have this, Thorfinn.

75
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,412
Since yours was shredded.

76
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:31,507
Come on...
Don't you have anything to say to Pater?

77
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:40,182
Jeez! In these situations,

78
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:43,769
you say, "Thank you very much." Come on!

79
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:50,651
Just say it!

80
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:54,571
Why have you been completely silent?

81
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:58,158
You seem so ungrateful
even though everyone's taking care of you!

82
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:03,455
I don't mind.
I know Thorfinn is a man of few words.

83
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:11,922
Thank you very much.

84
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,986
Hey, where are you going?

85
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,490
He said we can take a break
from harvesting wheat today.

86
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:43,579
The forest...
These wounds are nothing to me.

87
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:53,505
Wait! I'll go too.

88
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:30,167
<i>The way he moved when he was</i>

89
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,668
<i>attacked by Snake...</i>

90
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:36,131
<i>It wasn't normal.</i>

91
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,135
<i>And plus...</i>

92
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:47,142
The strong ones kill the weak ones.

93
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,771
That is only natural.

94
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:00,822
Thorfinn.

95
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:08,747
Have you been to war?

96
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,294
Yeah.

97
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:22,135
Did you

98
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:24,513
kill people?

99
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:27,724
Yeah.

100
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,901
About how many people?

101
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,071
Five...

102
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,615
or ten people?

103
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:51,873
Why do you want to know?

104
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,794
You hate war, don't you?

105
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:00,507
It's going to fall.

106
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:25,365
I don't remember how many.

107
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:30,454
<i>I killed a lot.</i>

108
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:35,709
<i>From the time I was five or six years old</i>

109
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,210
<i>I was on the battlefield.</i>

110
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:41,756
<i>I was part of
the Danish invasion of England too.</i>

111
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:51,850
I was a warrior.

112
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:58,273
Are you disgusted, Einar?

113
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:50,575
I was a warrior.

114
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,454
Are you disgusted, Einar?

115
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:40,625
<i>I don't remember how many I killed.</i>

116
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,182
<i>I killed a lot.</i>

117
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,973
I found you.

118
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,936
You brat...

119
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:27,607
Die!

120
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,994
You little brat!

121
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,915
- I'll kill you!
- Kill him!

122
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,917
Die!

123
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,030
Damn it!

124
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:49,165
Einar...

125
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,547
Why do you...

126
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,843
wake me up every time I have a nightmare?

127
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:14,149
<i>I've killed...</i>

128
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,527
<i>I've killed many people.</i>

129
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,989
<i>From one battle to another,</i>

130
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:23,533
<i>I attacked villages</i>

131
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:26,452
<i>and killed many people.</i>

132
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,124
<i>The people who killed your family...</i>

133
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:33,751
<i>I am...</i>

134
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,839
<i>no different from them.</i>

135
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,484
You...

136
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:01,487
<i>Is there anything</i>

137
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,199
<i>good that comes from being alive?</i>

138
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,287
I can't think of anything.

139
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:14,626
Of all the years I have lived,

140
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,962
I have never once

141
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:20,256
been glad that I was alive.

142
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:31,976
You...

143
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:34,479
You want to die?

144
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,481
I don't know

145
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,401
what kind of horrible things
you went through.

146
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:44,280
I don't even want to know
what kind of hell you've lived through.

147
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:47,825
But even though this may be hell,

148
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:50,036
we are able to chat about nonsense,

149
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,040
eat food, take a shit, and go to sleep...

150
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:03,132
We can do that

151
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:06,719
because someone else let us live.

152
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,640
You said you can't think of anything...

153
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:18,731
but you're wrong.

154
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:23,653
You're wrong!

155
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:28,241
Damn it!

156
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:32,161
Life's not that easy!

157
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:00,356
First of all...

158
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,027
it's not like you

159
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:07,030
are the one who killed my family.

160
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,827
The world doesn't revolve around you.

161
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,009
Thank you...

162
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:30,762
Einar.

163
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:35,183
Thank you for...

164
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:38,227
waking me up.

165
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:46,778
Jeez...

166
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:49,781
Thanks to all your sleep talking

167
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,783
I'm completely sleep deprived.

168
00:22:54,202 --> 00:22:55,495
I see...

169
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:05,379
- Sorry, Einar.
- Just go to sleep.

170
