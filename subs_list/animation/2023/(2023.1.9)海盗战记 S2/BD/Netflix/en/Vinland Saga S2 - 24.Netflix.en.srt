1
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:57,863
This is definitely beyond my expectations.

2
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:03,285
Iceland sure is a harsh terrain.

3
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:06,872
There are no trees at all.

4
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:13,254
The sun is so low.

5
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:17,925
I see now. A country with no fields, huh?

6
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:21,720
I guess you can't grow crops
when the day is so short.

7
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,598
Because it's winter.

8
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:29,228
During the summer,
the days are actually very long.

9
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,814
In areas with the right conditions,

10
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:34,733
some people grow wheat in the summer.

11
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:35,734
But

12
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:39,280
it's not enough to feed
everyone on the island.

13
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,240
Does everyone on the island

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,034
herd sheep or cattle?

15
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:46,829
No, there are craftsmen and fishermen too.

16
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:51,500
<i>There aren't enough pastures</i>

17
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,545
<i>for everyone on the island
to raise livestock.</i>

18
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:58,507
<i>That's why some people
live in communities and fish.</i>

19
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:03,387
That's what Thorfinn's village does.

20
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:05,764
Interesting...

21
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:09,977
What do you mean, "interesting"?
You were living here, weren't you?

22
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,315
Well, it was when I was still a child.

23
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,777
I ran away from home when I was about six.

24
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:21,322
From there I spent...

25
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:24,325
Um, I spent...

26
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,037
Wait, how old am I?

27
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:33,584
Thorfinn, Einar! The village is in sight.

28
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,466
Oh man...

29
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,760
I'm suddenly really scared.

30
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,138
How am I supposed to greet
my mother and sister?

31
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:52,603
Accept your fate, you prodigal son.

32
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,900
<i>You're finally coming home.</i>

33
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,285
Okay, good.

34
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:11,372
- Ouch.
- All right.

35
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,686
Thorfinn.

36
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,566
Everyone in the village
is waiting for you.

37
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:55,958
- Who's this? Ylva had a little brother?
- I have no clue.

38
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:02,965
- Tell me what my name is.
- Huh?

39
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,218
If you lived here, you should know.

40
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,974
F... Faxi?

41
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:16,478
- He got it wrong.
- How suspicious. We should tie him up.

42
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,231
Come on, go easy on me!

43
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,482
It's been so long!

44
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,610
Leif!

45
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,116
Oh well. Maybe we should show him to Ylva?

46
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:30,951
That's true.

47
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:36,540
Ylva was fighting with a merchant
from Norway over there.

48
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,128
Didn't I tell you, Berge?

49
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,882
Don't you dare try to do
shady business in this village.

50
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,469
I'm sorry, Ylva.

51
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,680
- I'll never do it again.
- Huh?

52
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,224
What was that? I can't hear you!

53
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:57,102
It's fine, Ylva.

54
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:59,688
I already got my money back.

55
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:02,066
Hey, Ylva!

56
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,655
I finally brought him back.

57
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:11,283
It's Thorfinn.

58
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,503
Thorfinn...

59
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,131
Thorfinn?

60
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:31,345
Sister...

61
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,724
Sister!

62
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:42,648
I don't know anyone by that name!

63
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,651
Come on, Ylva!

64
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,903
He's Thorfinn, your little brother!

65
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:49,404
Little brother?

66
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:53,700
Oh yeah, that was his name.

67
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,370
My brother died when he was a kid.

68
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,747
But he was alive!

69
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:01,625
Remember I told you
about how I met him in York?

70
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,795
Then why didn't you bring him home then?

71
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,341
Well, a lot of things happened.

72
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:16,098
It was a story you made up
to cheer me and my mother up, right?

73
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,767
Thank you, Leif.

74
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:22,479
No, that's not it.

75
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,065
More than that...

76
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:26,358
Huh?

77
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:32,364
You little midget! What is your
motive for tricking Leif, huh?

78
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,658
- No, no!
- You have an excuse?

79
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,160
Try telling me!

80
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,496
This is going to be tricky.

81
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:44,710
It's surprisingly difficult
to prove that you are yourself.

82
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,014
Let's go home, Thorfinn.

83
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,641
If you meet Helga, she'll recognize you.

84
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:01,768
Thorfinn...

85
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:04,980
- Who is that?
- That really did a number on him.

86
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:09,193
It can't be helped, can it?

87
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,278
Even I almost

88
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:14,364
forgot what my sister
and mother looked like.

89
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,369
It's only natural that
they'd forget about me.

90
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:26,543
Who cares if they forgot about you?

91
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:29,463
You're alive to see your parent

92
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:31,673
after wandering for over a decade.

93
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:34,843
You have to consider it a blessing.

94
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:39,348
I was separated from my parents
when I was a child,

95
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:41,642
and I don't even know where they are.

96
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,938
I'm envious of you.

97
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:53,278
Want me to act like
a dutiful son in your place?

98
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:58,158
No... Sorry, Bug-Eyes.

99
00:08:58,825 --> 00:08:59,660
Thank you.

100
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,472
Grandma, who is Thorfinn?

101
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,473
Thorfinn!

102
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,274
Thorfinn...

103
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,860
- Mom!
- What!

104
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,405
Idiot! Stop making things more confusing!

105
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:38,532
What's the harm?

106
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:42,828
No, Helga. This one is...

107
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,418
Thorfinn...

108
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:53,880
Mother...

109
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,260
You are

110
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,179
all grown up.

111
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,856
You look just like him.

112
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:16,987
You two are father and son after all.

113
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,626
Mother...

114
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:34,004
I'm sorry...

115
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:37,466
for everything!

116
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,012
Welcome home,

117
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,556
Thorfinn.

118
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,885
Mother! I heard Thorfinn came back!

119
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:24,596
Welcome home, Dad.

120
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,391
Welcome home.

121
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,102
Thorfinn?

122
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:39,152
Ari...

123
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:42,239
Thorfinn...

124
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,870
I'm sorry, Thorfinn.

125
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,873
It's our fault

126
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,000
that Thors...

127
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,806
Ari, I was the one who was an idiot.

128
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,567
All right, then.

129
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,073
Where are you off to, Einar?

130
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,577
It's about time I leave for the night.

131
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:31,955
Leif and the crew are staying
at Gothi's house,

132
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:34,082
so I'll stay there too.

133
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:36,793
Why don't you stay here?

134
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,881
It's a bit small, but we'll manage.

135
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,133
Oh, but...

136
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,802
- If you are Thorfinn's brother...
- He's my oldest son.

137
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:47,179
- then...
- Nice to meet you.

138
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,972
- you are my son.
- Hello.

139
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,267
This is your house.

140
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:54,853
Make yourself at home.

141
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:04,404
You wouldn't believe, Mother.

142
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:07,866
That stingy little merchant
changed the price of salt again...

143
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:12,913
You're that guy from earlier!
How dare you come into my house!

144
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:15,957
Sorry for the intrusion?

145
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,542
You haven't heard, Ylva?

146
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,794
Is this an inheritance fraud?

147
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:23,173
- Go and target someone who's rich!
- So strong!

148
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:25,926
Ylva, wait.

149
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:28,512
He's real.

150
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:31,515
Thorfinn actually came back.

151
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:33,225
Real?

152
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:34,768
What?

153
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,730
No way... That can't be.

154
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,066
It's not a story Leif made up?

155
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:45,195
What? It's true?

156
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:51,243
You're the real Thorfinn?

157
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,372
I'm home, Sister.

158
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,837
- Thorfinn!
- Sister!

159
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:08,260
Where have you been all this time,
you fool!

160
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:25,110
Hey, are you all right, Thorfinn?

161
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,948
I'm fine, Einar.

162
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:34,244
I am used to being punched...

163
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:46,882
One... One punch?

164
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,345
Mom, you're so strong!

165
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:54,431
- Mom, you're amazing!
- So cool!

166
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:57,934
Nobody can beat Mom!

167
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:08,904
There!

168
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:11,197
Come on!

169
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:12,699
Give it momentum!

170
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:47,442
<i>That night,</i>

171
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:50,236
<i>Thorfinn told</i>

172
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:53,740
<i>his family about
what he experienced during</i>

173
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,743
<i>the 16 years he was away.</i>

174
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:04,918
<i>Everything from Thors' death
to his departure from Ketil's farm.</i>

175
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:12,175
<i>He spoke calmly</i>

176
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:15,762
<i>and summarized the important events,</i>

177
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:18,390
<i>but his history of hatred and strife,</i>

178
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,394
<i>death and destruction,</i>

179
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,482
<i>despair and regret,</i>

180
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,738
<i>and sadness and rebirth</i>

181
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:38,743
<i>left those who were listening speechless.</i>

182
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:50,797
The people I killed

183
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,636
and the slaves who died in despair...

184
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:03,309
They may have
had warm families like this themselves.

185
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,898
My sins are unmeasurable.

186
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:13,695
I have to go

187
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:18,616
and build a land of peace in Vinland.

188
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,583
Do just that.

189
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:29,711
Mother?

190
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,756
There are many people

191
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:36,384
who wish to run away from this world.

192
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:39,637
Thors and I

193
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,891
ran away from Jomsborg,
the land of warriors,

194
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,643
and came to this island.

195
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:52,192
<i>People will run away as far as they can</i>

196
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:53,860
<i>from war and slavery.</i>

197
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:58,573
<i>They will run away until
they reach a place beyond the horizon.</i>

198
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:02,952
<i>There, you will be waiting for them
in a land of peace you built,</i>

199
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:05,955
<i>and you will welcome those people.</i>

200
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:12,587
To do that, you must go.

201
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,966
Thorfinn, son of Thors.

202
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:24,057
Thank you, Mother.

203
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:31,856
Building a nation in Vinland, huh?

204
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,775
That will be a huge project.

205
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,736
That's right.

206
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,281
I get that you are determined.

207
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:43,618
But you'll need manpower,
livestock, materials,

208
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:47,038
and new ships as well.

209
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,290
First of all, you need funds.

210
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,668
You won't be able to

211
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:54,462
raise such a large sum that easily.

212
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,263
Unless you have my help, that is.

213
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:09,018
Thank you, Leif.

214
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:13,690
- You're still not going to retire?
- You're amazing, Leif.

215
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,193
- Will it really work out like that?
- It'll be fine.

216
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:20,238
No worries.
There are many ways to go about it.

217
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:23,324
Don't overwork yourself, Dad.

218
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,451
I'm not overworking.

219
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,496
You still don't know what I'm capable of.

220
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:49,851
My goodness...

221
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:53,730
I can't believe you
actually went after him.

222
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,357
Sister...

223
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:01,821
I'm sorry.

224
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,041
Father really was an amazing person.

225
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,878
He was strong and kind

226
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,881
and always looking far ahead

227
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,884
<i>at something I can't perceive.</i>

228
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,728
After all, he was an "oddball."

229
00:20:58,002 --> 00:20:59,587
Whose grave is this?

230
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:04,676
A person Father tried to protect
a long time ago.

231
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:09,514
Was it someone important to him?

232
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,725
He was a slave.

233
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:15,853
He ran away from his master

234
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:17,522
and had collapsed outside,

235
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:19,899
so Father helped him.

236
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,069
He negotiated with the master

237
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,655
and traded eight sheep for the slave.

238
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:28,074
Eight sheep?

239
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,207
I guess you got
your soft heart from your dad.

240
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:58,896
It's freezing!
The cold is on another level at night.

241
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:01,274
I'm heading back, Thorfinn.

242
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,412
Hey...

243
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,667
if people want to run away from here,

244
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,753
where can they go?

245
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,677
You know

246
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:31,512
the answer, don't you?

247
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,992
