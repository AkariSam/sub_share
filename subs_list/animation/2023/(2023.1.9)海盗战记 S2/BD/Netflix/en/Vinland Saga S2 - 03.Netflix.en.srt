1
00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:04,834
Let's talk the night away, young master.

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:06,961
Tell us about your worries as a youth.

3
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:10,715
You just want to be
entertained by my stories!

4
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:13,551
Don't be ridiculous! I'm leaving! Let go!

5
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:17,805
Now, now... Feel free to tell us anything.

6
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:20,891
We're friends, aren't we?

7
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:22,393
Are we? Anyway, let go!

8
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:33,988
SNAKE

9
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:42,538
What's wrong? Get back at him!

10
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:50,755
Yeah! Right there!

11
00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:52,631
Come on... Again?

12
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:02,349
- They're so stupid!
- They fell!

13
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:03,559
Is this a draw?

14
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:11,150
None of you know anything.

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,487
You don't know anything.

16
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:17,573
You don't even know that you don't know.

17
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:21,118
If you don't even know
that you don't know,

18
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:24,330
there's no way you know anything about me.

19
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,709
Well, I understand you, young master.

20
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,420
Seventeen is a very odd age.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,214
You're neither an adult nor a kid.

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,968
- Pour.
- Yes.

23
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:40,721
Here... There you go.

24
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,811
Look at you go!

25
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:51,816
Fox, Badger...

26
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:55,402
I bet deep down,
you two are laughing at me too.

27
00:01:56,987 --> 00:01:59,156
This is going to be depressing.

28
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:03,077
That sobered me up. This was a bad idea.

29
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:05,204
I can hear you!

30
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:09,041
You're nothing but bodyguards

31
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,460
and you think you can look down on me?

32
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:14,964
You just work for my dad
for some meager wage.

33
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:17,174
Don't you have any pride as a warrior?

34
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,261
Please call us "guests."

35
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:23,764
Even people like us
are rather useful during fights.

36
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:26,392
Oh yeah?

37
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:30,813
You guys actually work?
I've never seen you do anything, Fox.

38
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:31,939
I know, right?

39
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:34,900
This village is so peaceful,
it's so boring.

40
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:37,361
Unsheathe it.

41
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,738
I'll check if you've become rusty or not.

42
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:55,588
See?

43
00:02:57,131 --> 00:03:01,135
As guests, this is what
the master pays us to do, after all.

44
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:08,726
Damn it! Just kill me already!

45
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:13,063
What should we do, Fox?

46
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,108
What went wrong?

47
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:20,279
We were supposed to drink and have fun
and get on the Ketil family's good side.

48
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:24,283
I know, I'm pathetic!

49
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,459
So basically, what you don't like

50
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,587
is the fact that
the common people don't treat you

51
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:38,839
like a grown man, right?

52
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:42,301
You guys too!

53
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:45,387
Well, that can't be helped.

54
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:48,015
You aren't a grown man after all.

55
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,850
But to become a grown man--

56
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:53,145
Hey, try to comfort him.

57
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,940
Shut up. I'm building up to that.

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,566
Just be quiet and listen.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,027
Hey, young master.

60
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:03,113
- Damn it...
- Becoming a grown man

61
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,908
is not that hard, you see.

62
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:09,620
There's something like a rite of passage.

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,914
That's all you need to do.

64
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,091
It's the act of killing.

65
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:28,264
Killing someone

66
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:31,308
really boosts your confidence.

67
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,311
You should experience it.

68
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:41,026
Once you learn how fragile
the human body is,

69
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:43,279
you will stop fearing them.

70
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:46,282
It'll help you mature.

71
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:51,328
That is how all men grow up.

72
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:58,002
But... who?

73
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:01,588
That's obvious!

74
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:05,009
For beginners,
there is beginner-level prey.

75
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,010
Don't worry.

76
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:12,891
You can find them

77
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,768
on this very farm.

78
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:26,739
They are people you are allowed to kill.

79
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:15,889
That was a good night's sleep.

80
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,308
I'm hungry.

81
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:22,729
One, two, three, four.

82
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,735
I guess today will be spent
harvesting wheat again.

83
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:32,823
This farm is way too big.

84
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:39,329
At this rate,

85
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,332
we won't be able to
clear the land during springtime.

86
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,295
Ideally, I want it to be ready
for sowing in the fall.

87
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:49,882
First we have to dig out
the roots and rocks,

88
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:53,135
then turn over the soil,
then let the soil rest...

89
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,971
Would they let us borrow a heavy plow?

90
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:08,400
Thorfinn! What's wrong?

91
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:11,862
Are you dreaming? Thorfinn!

92
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,622
Are you okay?

93
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:23,665
You seemed really distressed.

94
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:34,760
How bad was the dream
that it would make you like that?

95
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,014
Dream?

96
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,266
What was it?

97
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,602
I can't remember.

98
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:53,779
Well, go wash your face.
Then we can start our morning chores.

99
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,035
Dreams you can't remember
are better off forgotten...

100
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:23,350
Good morning.

101
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,810
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

102
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,312
Yes! Good morning!

103
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:30,023
Do you want to wash your face? Go ahead.

104
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,817
I've used it already.

105
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:35,320
Oh, no! Okay! Sorry! Take your time!

106
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:36,947
I mean,

107
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:40,325
there's no point in washing
a face like mine anyway!

108
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,703
Oh, don't say that...

109
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,415
I think you have a lovely face.

110
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:52,170
Are you okay?

111
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,632
- Are you hurt somewhere?
- No, it's my heart...

112
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,801
Oh no! Does it hurt?

113
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:01,221
No, I'm fine!
It's not an illness or anything.

114
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,723
- Is it a wound?
- Um, no...

115
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:04,016
<i>What is this?</i>

116
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,268
<i>I feel uneasy.</i>

117
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,857
<i>I have a feeling that dream was something</i>

118
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,068
<i>I shouldn't forget.</i>

119
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,825
My name is Arnheid.

120
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,827
You arrived here recently, right?

121
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:27,873
Yes! I am Einar. I came from England.

122
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:30,334
Oh, England?

123
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,127
You're so fluent,

124
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:34,504
I assumed you were Nordic.

125
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:37,215
Yes, everyone in my hometown,

126
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:41,011
including me, was of Nordic descent.

127
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:43,972
Everyone in the village spoke
English and Norse.

128
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:45,807
I have a thick accent,

129
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:48,810
so it may be hard to understand, ma'am.

130
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:53,440
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry...

131
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,069
I haven't told you about myself, have I?

132
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,620
You're not the master's daughter?

133
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,623
No, I'm not.

134
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,711
I'm a slave, just like you.

135
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:17,923
I am the master's personal maid.

136
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,058
Good morning, all of you.

137
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:32,020
What is this? Are the slaves
planning an escape this morning?

138
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,980
Good morning.

139
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,900
What's your name?

140
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,027
Thorfinn.

141
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:41,196
Are you a slave too?

142
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:43,031
You don't look familiar.

143
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:46,535
I'm Einar.
I've been here since the summer.

144
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:53,417
Thorfinn and Einar.

145
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:57,212
Come with us for a second.

146
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:11,017
This has become one busy morning.

147
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,440
Who are they?

148
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,025
They're carrying swords.

149
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:22,070
They're not regular people, right?

150
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:25,824
They're guests...

151
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:29,578
A defense force that resides on this farm.

152
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:31,997
They're bodyguards.

153
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,209
And they have business with us?

154
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,046
I doubt it's going to be anything good.

155
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:46,052
I think you have a lovely face.

156
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:52,184
You seem to be in a good mood, Einar.

157
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:53,977
Oh, sorry.

158
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:56,104
No worries!

159
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:58,982
You look like the lively type.

160
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,969
All right, young master.

161
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:31,598
Go ahead and slash them! Slash!

162
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:35,685
Slash? Don't tell me...

163
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:39,147
Yes, big one. That's right.

164
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:40,690
What?

165
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,653
It's a ceremony for the young master
to become an adult.

166
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:47,322
Die for us, will you?

167
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,085
It's a ceremony for the young master
to become an adult.

168
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,045
Die for us, will you?

169
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,469
Don't be ridiculous!

170
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:13,056
What wrong did we do
to deserve such treatment?!

171
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:15,183
You didn't do anything wrong.

172
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:18,770
It's just that your life
doesn't belong to you.

173
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,647
That's all.

174
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:24,776
The rightful owner is free to do
whatever he pleases with his possessions.

175
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:29,656
You guys are
slaves belonging to Master Olmar's family.

176
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:33,493
He is going to kill you himself.
You should be honored.

177
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:35,328
Good for you!

178
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,998
Just give up.

179
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:42,377
These guys

180
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:44,796
belong to my dad.

181
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:46,506
They're not mine.

182
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,301
If I kill them,
I have to pay compensation.

183
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:53,638
How pitiful, young master!

184
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:56,016
You're saying that this late in the game?

185
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:59,060
Are you scared of your father?

186
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,104
Are you scared of killing?

187
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:02,939
Or maybe both?

188
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,901
Shut up! I'm not scared of anything!

189
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:09,779
Then let's get to it! Just slash them!

190
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:14,492
Thorfinn, run away.

191
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:17,287
It's fine!

192
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,042
Damn it!

193
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:26,463
What are you doing?
Go and tell the master, Thorfinn!

194
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:31,468
Come on! You can do it, young master!
Your opponent is ready to fight!

195
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,598
Don't move, kid.

196
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:38,558
Just watch quietly.

197
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,116
What a drag...

198
00:15:58,286 --> 00:15:59,913
You can cut me.

199
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:02,874
Go, young master!

200
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,004
One person is enough, right?

201
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,924
Please let him go back to work.

202
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,760
You can cut me.

203
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,550
Ouch...

204
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:59,055
It's morning?

205
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,396
Hey, Gramps!

206
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,358
Gramps! Are you not here?

207
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:26,958
Gramps!

208
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,960
Where's my breakfast?

209
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,087
Gramps!

210
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:35,050
What are you talking about,
waking up so late?!

211
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,426
If you want to eat,

212
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:39,387
why don't you help out with
the harvest once in a while!

213
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,723
No way!

214
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:44,684
Then I won't feed you!

215
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:47,228
Fend for yourself.

216
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:49,689
Damn you, Gramps.

217
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,609
I'm not going through
the trouble of cooking.

218
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:55,445
Oh well, I guess I'll head back.

219
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:14,172
Master Olmar can cut me.

220
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,550
Please let Einar go back to work.

221
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:20,303
Today's a busy day.

222
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:25,391
What did you say?

223
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:40,824
Sorry, what was your name again?

224
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:43,159
I'm Thorfinn.

225
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:45,829
Thorfinn,

226
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:49,707
do you understand what you just said?

227
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,044
If you let him cut you,
you're going to die.

228
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:56,047
Right...

229
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,218
You idiot!

230
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,387
What are you saying--

231
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:06,891
You stay quiet.
It's not your place to butt in.

232
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,228
Did you all hear him?

233
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:13,731
Once in a while, you meet people like him.

234
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:16,484
You know,

235
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:20,280
I just can't ignore
those kinds of statements.

236
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,781
If I let them slide,

237
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:26,286
they will bring down
the value of our commodity.

238
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:29,205
Say, Thorfinn,

239
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,458
what kind of commodity do you think

240
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,127
warriors like us handle?

241
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,422
Who knows...

242
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:41,843
It's death.

243
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:52,562
No matter who it is,
everyone is afraid to die.

244
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:55,440
No matter who it is.
I can say for certain.

245
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:58,026
Take a look at the young master.

246
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:00,320
He's even afraid of someone else's death.

247
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,530
Shut up! I'm not afraid.

248
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:05,074
That's fine, though.

249
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:08,036
It has value
because people are afraid of it.

250
00:20:08,536 --> 00:20:12,290
If not, we wouldn't be able to
make a living with a sword.

251
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,594
I'm sure you're afraid too.

252
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,888
Be afraid.

253
00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:34,896
I'm so hungry.

254
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,774
Hey, you hoodlums!

255
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:42,695
Stop it, you guys!

256
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:46,032
Jeez, those idiots.

257
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:49,410
They're causing trouble again.

258
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,538
Stop it!

259
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:56,042
Damn it! You bastards!

260
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:59,295
Come on.

261
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:01,547
Beg for your life.

262
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,466
Don't be stubborn,

263
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,260
Thorfinn.

264
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:12,392
Ouch...

265
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:16,354
You'd better hurry, or else your tiny body

266
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:20,108
will become even smaller!

267
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:31,661
He didn't even bat an eye.

268
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:33,246
That's impressive.

269
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,167
If I remember correctly,
he's the master's slave...

270
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:43,881
- Just kill him!
- Do it!

271
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:44,966
Why...

272
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:49,220
do I have to be afraid to die?

273
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:56,394
Are you living
because you don't want to die?

274
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:00,732
Is there anything...

275
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,360
good that comes from being alive?

276
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:12,368
I can't think of anything.

277
00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:20,460
Of all the years I have lived,
I have never once

278
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:23,337
been glad that I was alive.

279
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:46,402
Next, it'll be your eye.

280
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:51,032
Be afraid.

281
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:52,617
Stop, Fox!

282
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:00,708
Huh? Snake?

283
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,472
How terrible.

284
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:22,688
Boss... welcome back. When did you...?

285
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:25,066
- Fox.
- Yes, sir!

286
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:28,861
- Come here.
- Yes, sir!

287
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,922
- Badger.
- Yes, sir!

288
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:54,053
Explain.

289
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:39,408
<i>Awakening.</i>
