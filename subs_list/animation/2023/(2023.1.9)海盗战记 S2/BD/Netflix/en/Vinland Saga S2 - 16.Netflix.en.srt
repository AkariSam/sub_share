1
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:28,482
Be careful.

2
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:31,569
- He's strong.
- Got it.

3
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,074
Wh... What is going on
so early in the morning?

4
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:45,041
It doesn't seem like anyone's here.

5
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:48,252
I can't tell with all this junk.

6
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:51,464
Throw everything out!

7
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,511
Jeez, what is this all about?

8
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,514
He escaped.

9
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:04,143
- What?
- Gardar escaped.

10
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:08,355
Is there any other reason why
they would be ransacking our shed?

11
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:16,322
Arnheid!

12
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,029
Wait, Einar!

13
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:24,283
Stop for a second. Einar!

14
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:26,994
If Gardar escaped,

15
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:29,788
he will definitely
try to find Arnheid again.

16
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,460
What will you do once you're with Arnheid?

17
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:37,129
Are you going to chase Gardar away?

18
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:41,842
I don't know.

19
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:43,886
But...

20
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:46,430
there must be

21
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,807
something that

22
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:51,143
I can do to help Arnheid!

23
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,960
Arnheid!

24
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:23,509
That's not him.

25
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,552
It's not Gardar.

26
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:26,971
It's two slaves.

27
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:31,517
What were their names...?

28
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:34,019
Oh, they work for the master...

29
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,481
Thorfinn and Einar?

30
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:40,109
Yes, that's right.

31
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:42,111
What are they here for?

32
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:46,282
What should we do, Boss?
Should we chase them away?

33
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,244
No, don't mind them.

34
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:52,830
Let them be.

35
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:06,593
Um...

36
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:08,679
Arnheid.

37
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,266
Yes...

38
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:15,686
It's about Gardar, right?

39
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:18,689
You knew?

40
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:23,610
Yes.

41
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,239
I...

42
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,783
let him escape.

43
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:32,661
I cut

44
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,955
Gardar's rope.

45
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,085
Gardar

46
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,254
killed the guard.

47
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,591
And I thought we were

48
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,802
both going to die.

49
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:51,597
I...

50
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:01,398
After that,

51
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:05,235
the other guards

52
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,779
rushed out

53
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:09,490
but Gardar

54
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:11,950
killed them all.

55
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:18,707
<i>The guards again...</i>

56
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,877
<i>This is bad... really bad.</i>

57
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,217
Einar.

58
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,136
The guards are watching us.

59
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:33,263
Act like you're helping with the dishes

60
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,140
and get closer to Arnheid.

61
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:43,649
Stay calm

62
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,485
and tell us what the situation is.

63
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:52,491
During the fight,

64
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:55,536
Gardar also suffered a bad injury.

65
00:06:56,995 --> 00:07:00,374
Then the two of us ran away in the rain

66
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,002
until we got to the old master's house.

67
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:06,588
<i>But</i>

68
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,007
<i>while I was treating his wound,</i>

69
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:11,427
<i>Gardar lost consciousness.</i>

70
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,264
He was so heavy and I couldn't carry him.

71
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:16,723
But

72
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:20,310
I was somehow able to hide him.

73
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:24,398
So Gardar is here?

74
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:25,941
Yes.

75
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:30,487
The old master helped us out.

76
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:34,783
Snake and his men came right after that.

77
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:37,744
They seem to think

78
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,247
that Gardar escaped

79
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:43,584
and is hiding somewhere.

80
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:47,296
They're in the main house

81
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:51,300
waiting for Gardar to come and see me.

82
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,845
Snake and two other men.

83
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,308
Why...?

84
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,603
Why did you do something
so dangerous on your own?

85
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,189
You said you'd let the storm pass

86
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:07,816
for the sake of your child!

87
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:18,035
Why...?

88
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:29,087
A dream...

89
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:31,840
I couldn't help

90
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:35,010
but dream, I guess.

91
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:37,804
About my unborn child,

92
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,765
Gardar,

93
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,726
and our family...

94
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:45,687
I thought

95
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:49,650
that maybe things were back to normal.

96
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:54,321
Back to...

97
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,532
Back to normal.

98
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,206
<i>His eyes</i>

99
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:08,544
<i>used to be filled with so much confidence.</i>

100
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,088
<i>And now...</i>

101
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:20,055
We're absolutely pitiful.

102
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:24,977
We lost Hjalti and yet

103
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,647
the two of us are pitifully

104
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,482
trying to hang on to life.

105
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:34,945
And despite that

106
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,990
we're still dreaming.

107
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:53,297
How are Gardar's wounds?

108
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:55,340
Did he stop bleeding?

109
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,014
The right side of his chest

110
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,100
was bleeding so much.

111
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,853
When I hid him

112
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:10,856
it was still bleeding.

113
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,235
We don't have much time.

114
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,162
Arnheid...

115
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:28,498
Are you ready to

116
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,252
share the same fate as Gardar?

117
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,973
If you want to
spend your life with Gardar,

118
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,434
you'll have to run away with him.

119
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,064
But you are with child.

120
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,233
No doubt, the journey will be difficult.

121
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:59,237
But if you still want to do it,

122
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:02,866
I will help you.

123
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:05,619
At this point,

124
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,996
that is the only way.

125
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:22,094
<i>The only way, huh?</i>

126
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:30,227
I will help too. With two people,

127
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:32,354
maybe we can think of a plan.

128
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:34,815
Thorfinn...

129
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:53,792
Ouch!

130
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:56,461
Don't sleep.

131
00:11:56,461 --> 00:12:00,382
The next time you take your eyes
off of Arnheid, I'll break your nose.

132
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:03,510
Yes, I'm sorry.

133
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:09,808
Who is it?

134
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:15,814
Um, I should start preparing lunch soon.

135
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,361
Take the equipment and make it outside.

136
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:25,574
You're a decoy.
Stay where people can see you.

137
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:30,454
Yes, I understand.

138
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:44,801
What a sad situation they are in.

139
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,929
Don't you think so, Snake?

140
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,934
"Slaves

141
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:56,938
were destined to become slaves
because they were born inferior."

142
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:58,899
That is what people say.

143
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:01,818
As if everyone
was meant to play a certain role.

144
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:06,323
But I don't think so.

145
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:09,493
Slaves were just unlucky.

146
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:12,287
It's as simple as that.

147
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:16,333
If luck wasn't on our side, you and I

148
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,419
may have ended up as slaves ourselves.

149
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:22,339
So what?

150
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,508
That has nothing to do with this.

151
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:27,719
Five of our men were killed.

152
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,639
I won't be satisfied
until I kill that bastard.

153
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:35,477
If I let him get away
with killing my subordinates

154
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:38,563
I'd have no right
to carry a sword anymore.

155
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:46,238
Well then, just get rid of your sword.

156
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,410
That sword

157
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:56,998
is not from around here, that much I know.

158
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:02,170
I assume you have your reasons
for ending up here.

159
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,799
But unless you get rid of your sword,

160
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,261
you won't be able to
eliminate the root of the problem.

161
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:13,390
That's enough talking, Gramps.

162
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,851
It's time for old people to take a nap.

163
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:21,439
<i>I will give you my field.</i>

164
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,317
<i>Cultivate the land</i>

165
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,486
<i>and try growing life.</i>

166
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:30,824
<i>It's much better
than waving around a sword.</i>

167
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:35,871
I can't

168
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,456
stand or walk anymore.

169
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:40,750
I will die soon.

170
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:45,338
Take this chance
to start living a normal life.

171
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,676
I owe you

172
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:53,513
for having you
read the Bible to me, after all.

173
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:00,437
Now is not the time for this nonsense.

174
00:15:00,937 --> 00:15:02,939
As if I'd work on a field...

175
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,735
- Boss!
- Huh?

176
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:08,612
There's somebody there.

177
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:15,243
Over there. The third tree from the back.

178
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:19,372
I think that's him
in the shadow of the tree.

179
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:24,502
All right.

180
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:57,827
They're out.

181
00:15:58,328 --> 00:15:59,245
One horse...

182
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:03,375
two horses, three horses.
Okay, that's all of them.

183
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:10,590
I'm counting on you, Einar.

184
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,693
Spread out.

185
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:32,779
Chase him from different
directions and viewpoints.

186
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,369
Old Master!

187
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:42,664
Sorry, but I'm going to borrow
a horse and wagon.

188
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:46,668
I promise I will work
and pay you back for it.

189
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:49,838
Stop worrying about such trivial things.

190
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:53,133
More importantly,
put me on the wagon as well.

191
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,635
If I'm on it, nobody will question you

192
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:58,054
while you're on this farm.

193
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:00,390
No, but...

194
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,600
I can't get you involved in this.

195
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:06,312
I'm already involved in this.

196
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:10,525
Stop bickering and help me out already.

197
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,030
Yes. Thank you so much.

198
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:23,663
That bastard is trying to
escape into the forest.

199
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:27,459
We can't navigate those woods on horses.

200
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,919
Catch up to him! Don't let him inside.

201
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,468
<i>Damn it! It's so far!</i>

202
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:54,819
<i>He's still alive.</i>

203
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,113
<i>She did a good job.</i>

204
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:00,700
<i>But he's as cold as stone.</i>

205
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:03,870
<i>He lost too much blood.</i>

206
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:07,582
<i>Please hang in there.</i>

207
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:13,880
<i>He's fast.</i>

208
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,927
<i>No matter how you look at it,
he's not running like a wounded person.</i>

209
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,514
Spider, Badger!

210
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:24,474
Keep chasing him.

211
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:26,726
But don't get too close.

212
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:28,895
If he's Gardar,

213
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:31,231
you two won't be able to handle him.

214
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:33,650
I'll send backup later.

215
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:37,987
Until then, keep on chasing him. Got it?

216
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:39,823
I'm counting on you.

217
00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:43,493
What?! Hey, Boss! Where are you...?

218
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,251
The wagon is ready.
Let's rush to the southern border.

219
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,586
Once we're in a different country,

220
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,214
it'll be hard for the guests to chase us.

221
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:59,134
I'll part ways at some point
as a diversion.

222
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:01,177
I'll try to lure as many as I can.

223
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:06,850
Old Master, please accompany us
until the end of the farm.

224
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:09,811
Understood.

225
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:44,470
<i>I didn't hear any horses.</i>

226
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,435
<i>He got off his horse and ran here?</i>

227
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:57,817
I see...

228
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:01,821
He's unconscious, huh?

229
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,575
No wonder I couldn't sense his presence.

230
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:13,708
Thorfinn...

231
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:27,055
Just so you know, Thorfinn.

232
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:29,974
Negotiation is not an option.

233
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:34,938
Hand over Gardar without a fight.

234
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:36,981
Or else

235
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:39,525
I'll cut you down.

236
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,117
<i>There are three pursuers.</i>

237
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:51,120
<i>But right now, Snake is the only one here.</i>

238
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,705
<i>I don't sense the other two.</i>

239
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:55,875
<i>If I can somehow stop him,</i>

240
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,294
<i>we can still run away.</i>

241
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:03,633
<i>Dodge his sword
and land a blow to his chin.</i>

242
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,805
Are you going to fight, Thorfinn?

243
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:12,517
Oh well, I guess it can't be helped
in this situation.

244
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:15,270
You're genuinely trying to help someone.

245
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,773
You're using your fists for a just cause.

246
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,444
That being said,

247
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:27,991
your opponent has his own
just cause as well.

248
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:31,202
What will you do, Thorfinn?

249
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:34,414
Will you uphold nonviolence regardless?

250
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:39,210
Or will you fight for the sake of
helping others?

251
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:45,883
Which one leads to the path
of a true warrior?

252
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:48,511
There's no time to think.

253
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,099
Look, right in front of you.

254
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:00,416
You think you can win against him
with your head in the clouds?

255
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:34,033
<i>What a strange stance.</i>

256
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:36,744
<i>It's not a spear or an axe.</i>

257
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:38,663
<i>A sword?</i>

258
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:42,875
<i>No...</i>

259
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:39,075
<i>''Way Home.''</i>

260
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:40,451
