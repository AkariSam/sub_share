1
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,427
Sixteen!

2
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,515
Hey! He's still standing!

3
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,520
Seventeen!

4
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:49,522
Eighteen!

5
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,360
Nineteen!

6
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:05,079
Twenty!

7
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:08,999
I lost!

8
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,586
He's amazing even though he's so tiny!

9
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:15,965
He's still standing!

10
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:18,634
That's impressive!

11
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:22,346
I lost big money because of you, Drott!

12
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,015
What are you doing!

13
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:27,768
Hurry up and crack his head open!

14
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:29,520
Keep your eyes on him!

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,980
Damn it!

16
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,356
<i>Something is not right.</i>

17
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:35,818
<i>My punches feel light for some reason.</i>

18
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,905
Damn it!

19
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:41,949
<i>Interesting...</i>

20
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,661
<i>That messenger is indeed
used to being punched.</i>

21
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:49,874
<i>Right before he's hit by the fist,
he twists his neck and hips</i>

22
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:52,668
<i>to distribute the impact
throughout his body.</i>

23
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:56,964
<i>But it's so subtle that nobody</i>

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,301
<i>realizes that he is dodging the attack.</i>

25
00:03:02,177 --> 00:03:04,388
<i>However, Drott is also a skilled fighter.</i>

26
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,725
<i>He won't last very long at this rate.</i>

27
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,395
Twenty-three!

28
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:15,774
Twenty-four!

29
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:17,443
Thorfinn...

30
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,488
<i>Even still...</i>

31
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:25,242
<i>violence should be the last resort.</i>

32
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:28,162
<i>I wish...</i>

33
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:33,125
<i>I wish I knew how to choose
the first course of action that's best.</i>

34
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:38,255
<i>Is this it?</i>

35
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:41,884
<i>This is the "first course of action"?</i>

36
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:46,972
<i>Not punching back
and just enduring it all?</i>

37
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:49,975
<i>Is that how</i>

38
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:54,855
<i>you are going to live from now on?</i>

39
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:02,154
What are you going to do?

40
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,572
All right!

41
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:13,123
What's that? Are they fighting?

42
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,585
Hey...

43
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,629
Come on, Drott!

44
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:21,006
Thorfinn!

45
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,260
Stop it!

46
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,636
What's going on?

47
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:30,224
He has nothing to do with this farm!

48
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:33,477
<i>Oh no!</i>

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,623
All right! I felt that one!

50
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:58,168
Thirty-two!

51
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:00,796
That made a crazy sound!

52
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:03,173
Did he die?

53
00:05:05,092 --> 00:05:06,302
Thorfinn!

54
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:15,811
What's going on?

55
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:18,188
I thought you guys left the farm already.

56
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:21,025
How did it turn into this?

57
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:26,864
If he endures 100 strikes from them,

58
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:30,701
they will let him speak
directly with the king.

59
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:34,288
That's what they promised.

60
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:37,541
No way...

61
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,878
He did it for the farm?

62
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,428
That's enough. Stop this.

63
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:53,932
The farm is surrendering.
They've decided already.

64
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,394
You idiot.

65
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,857
You're too nice for your own good.

66
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,027
If a conversation could've solved this,

67
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,820
we would've done that already.

68
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:14,328
Are you sure about that?

69
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:19,833
Did you really,

70
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,045
earnestly,

71
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:27,549
put in the effort to solve this

72
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:31,053
over a conversation?

73
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,268
Just because they took up their swords,

74
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,271
you retaliated with your sword

75
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:44,858
without even thinking about it.

76
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,903
That was 32 punches.

77
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:49,863
- Let's divide the money.
- He got up!

78
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:51,115
Hey, wait a second.

79
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,201
You must be kidding!

80
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,119
No way!

81
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:58,122
He stood up!

82
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,173
What are you relaxing for,
you middle-parted jerk!

83
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:13,554
Your punches are nothing more
than a bug bite to me.

84
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:16,515
You have 68 more punches.

85
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:18,725
Hurry up and get it over with.

86
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:21,311
I don't have all day.

87
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:25,732
I have people waiting for me!

88
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,540
Stop it! This battle is--

89
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:47,087
Einar, he'll die if he continues.

90
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:29,046
Ninety-eight.

91
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:37,012
Ninety-nine.

92
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:44,937
A Hundred.

93
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,344
Thorfinn, son of Thors.

94
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,848
I'm sorry I doubted you.

95
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,768
You are...

96
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:29,773
You are a real warrior.

97
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:37,864
Captain,

98
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,827
this man once served the king

99
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,288
as a royal guard, just like us.

100
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,293
Please grant Thorfinn
a meeting with the king.

101
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:02,848
You're small, but it seems
you are well trained, Thorfinn.

102
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:07,311
But why didn't you punch back?

103
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,688
If you defeated Drott,

104
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:14,067
that would have proved
your skill as a former royal guard.

105
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,031
What kind of question is that?

106
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:23,660
There's no point in a peace negotiation
if you go around punching people.

107
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:28,665
I met you guys for the first time today.

108
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,461
We don't know anything about each other.

109
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:34,796
We hold no grudges.

110
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:38,675
So why do we have to fight each other?

111
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:39,593
It's ridiculous.

112
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,264
Canute and Ketil
are the ones who want to fight.

113
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:47,476
The two leaders should just
play a game of <i>hnefatafl</i>

114
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,728
and settle their issues.

115
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:52,230
There is absolutely no reason

116
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,317
for all these people to gather
and shed blood.

117
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:03,533
We met for the first time today.

118
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,913
You guys are not my enemies.

119
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,805
No one is my enemy.

120
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:36,441
You sure have guts

121
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:40,028
to boldly deny war in front of

122
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:42,823
this many professional warriors.

123
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:45,534
But to think...

124
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,996
Ketil and His Majesty
playing <i>hnefatafl</i>, huh?

125
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:52,582
What's so funny?

126
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,167
Pardon me.

127
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:58,880
Try proposing that idea
to the king himself.

128
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:01,758
His Majesty

129
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:04,719
is not fighting wars because he wants to.

130
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:08,098
If you are allowed to speak with him,

131
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,891
you will come to see his intentions.

132
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,064
Make way.

133
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:19,067
I will take this messenger to the king.

134
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,912
Come on, Einar.

135
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:36,543
We're going to meet
the very person who starts wars.

136
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:39,754
I'm sure you have something to say.

137
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:43,258
Yeah!

138
00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:46,761
I have a whole lot to say.

139
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:26,218
All of them

140
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,346
were killed in this battle?

141
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:32,849
Don't look, Einar.

142
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:35,936
Pater...

143
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,104
Don't look.

144
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:41,816
If you find Pater among them,

145
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,069
you'll become too emotional.

146
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,437
All right, let him through.

147
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,440
I'll respect your decision.

148
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:24,317
Thank you very much.

149
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,154
You may come forward!

150
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:00,020
So you were alive?

151
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:02,981
It's been a while,

152
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:04,649
Thorfinn.

153
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:08,987
After I

154
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,656
turned you into a slave...

155
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:14,576
Or rather,

156
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:17,203
after what I did to Askeladd,

157
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:20,123
you must really hate me.

158
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:28,632
I took up a weapon against
the royal family of Denmark

159
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:31,176
and yet my life was spared.

160
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,680
I am grateful for your consideration.

161
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:38,892
I am sorry

162
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:41,603
about the cut on your face.

163
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:45,482
<i>The man who left a scar
on the king's face...</i>

164
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,526
<i>Thorfinn Karlsefni.</i>

165
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:53,406
<i>He was said to have fought
on par with Thorkell.</i>

166
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:56,701
<i>Who knew he was so small and young.</i>

167
00:15:58,411 --> 00:16:00,914
You cut the king?

168
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,920
I can't recognize you
with your face looking like that,

169
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:10,006
but it seems you really are
the Thorfinn I know.

170
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:12,175
I must say,

171
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,136
you really learned
how to give a model answer.

172
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:20,141
<i>Four years, huh?</i>

173
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:25,897
<i>It has already been four years since then.</i>

174
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:29,192
That is enough time

175
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,611
to change a person.

176
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:43,039
Canute, please leave this farm alone.

177
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,250
I can't.

178
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,254
This all started because of Ketil.

179
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,467
Ketil's son Olmar held a grudge
because he couldn't become a thegn

180
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:57,554
and murdered ten of my men.

181
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:00,223
I heard about that.

182
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,684
But you've done enough.

183
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,937
More than 100 people
from the farm's side died.

184
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:08,732
With this many workers dead,

185
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:12,027
this area may not be able
to get back on its feet.

186
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:17,032
I summoned them to surrender beforehand.

187
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:21,077
It is Ketil's fault for misjudging
the difference in our strength.

188
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:23,079
And that is why

189
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,833
this battle will not end
until the Ketil family is dealt with.

190
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:30,378
More like,

191
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,589
until you make this farm your own.

192
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,469
Your pretense isn't fooling anyone.

193
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:41,848
You call yourself a king,
but you're nothing but a robber.

194
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:45,101
What makes you different from

195
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,771
any other Viking gang lord out there?

196
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:51,441
<i>If you want a field that bad,</i>

197
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,234
<i>try making it yourself.</i>

198
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:57,072
<i>Plow the soil, watch over it,</i>

199
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:58,656
<i>and cultivate it yourself!</i>

200
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,492
<i>Then</i>

201
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:04,996
you will really understand
how horrible it is

202
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:08,166
to take it away.

203
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,379
Canute,

204
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:18,051
<i>remember you told me back in Gainsborough,</i>

205
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,180
<i>that you will make a paradise on earth,</i>

206
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:26,184
<i>a utopia for those who are suffering?</i>

207
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:32,148
Is that still your wish?

208
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:37,070
A gang lord, huh?

209
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,489
Indeed,

210
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:43,451
I am the Viking gang lord
of all Viking gang lords.

211
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,248
I am the emperor.

212
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,543
The strongest Viking of the North Sea.

213
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,422
The ruler of the largest territory
in the Nordic region.

214
00:18:56,923 --> 00:18:58,883
The commander

215
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:01,594
of thousands of ships
and tens of thousands of soldiers.

216
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:04,180
My power exceeds human understanding

217
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,474
and makes the impossible possible.

218
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:11,563
Look!

219
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:15,608
I will calm those waves with my power.

220
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,865
In the name of Canute, the emperor,

221
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:25,076
I order the waves to calm down!

222
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:47,056
Did you see my power?

223
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:51,853
I cannot even stop the rippling waves.

224
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,524
Do you know who is making

225
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:57,692
those waves?

226
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:06,784
It's God.

227
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:11,539
<i>Creating a paradise on earth</i>

228
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,335
<i>means going against the rules he has set.</i>

229
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:18,463
<i>It's a rebellion against God.</i>

230
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:22,675
As long as we abide by his rules,

231
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:25,303
humans cannot find happiness.

232
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:29,224
Rebellion?

233
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,101
Look at us, Thorfinn.

234
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:35,230
Look at us, Vikings.

235
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:39,067
We are the bearers
of chaos and destruction,

236
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:41,527
the plunderers of terror.

237
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,616
Do you think we have the right
to live in paradise?

238
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:51,246
<i>But that is exactly what humans are.</i>

239
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,665
<i>We encompass</i>

240
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:57,252
<i>the very essence of sinning,
wandering humans.</i>

241
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:02,340
I must save these people
who were abandoned by God,

242
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,802
or else building a paradise
will be impossible.

243
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:11,391
Saving the Vikings?

244
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:13,601
That's right.

245
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,146
Subjugating them, controlling them,

246
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,399
unifying their power,

247
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:23,069
and leading them to paradise is something

248
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,405
only I can do.

249
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:28,116
I need power.

250
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:31,494
I will unify the power of humans

251
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:35,915
<i>and fight against God.</i>

252
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,800
<i>You're an incredible man, Canute.</i>

253
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:49,095
<i>I've never even thought about</i>

254
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:51,556
<i>saving the Vikings.</i>

255
00:21:53,808 --> 00:21:56,185
I am going to smack you.

256
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:59,230
I don't give a damn about whatever

257
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,690
big plans you have in mind.

258
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:05,153
But if you are going to kill
people today just for that,

259
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:06,946
who is going to save them?

260
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:10,324
You save Vikings
because they give you power,

261
00:22:10,324 --> 00:22:12,368
but you kill and rob from people

262
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:13,911
who are useless to you?

263
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:17,749
Building paradise? Don't make me laugh!

264
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:20,793
I had

265
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:23,755
my village burned down by King Ethelred

266
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:26,799
and my family killed by King Sweyn.

267
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:31,429
I don't care what kind of ideals they had.

268
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:35,183
I've had enough!

269
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:39,771
I will not be a victim
to you people anymore.

270
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:48,362
Hate me if you want.

271
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:51,616
I don't need your forgiveness.

272
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:54,619
What did you say?

273
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:58,081
Stop it, Einar.

274
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:05,755
Canute, let me ask you again.

275
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:08,883
Do you have any intention
of leaving this farm?

276
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:13,638
No. I need Ketil's wealth for my project.

277
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:19,102
So what will you do, Thorfinn?

278
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:22,730
Will you kill me right here, right now?

279
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:27,443
If you don't kill me,

280
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:30,154
there is no way to stop me.

281
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:38,824
<i>"Two paths."</i>

282
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:40,993
