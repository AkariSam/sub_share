00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,762
Water--

4
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,098
Oh, this place.

5
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,768
If you go a little past
that elevated track,

6
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,687
there's an underground entrance.

7
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,605
Water gets collected over there.

8
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,649
Thanks for the help.

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,111
Hey, do you need a place to sleep?

10
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,195
HOTEL
CLEAN FUTONS

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,573
I have clean rooms
and aired-out futons, you know.

12
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,910
Sorry, but we're just passing through.

13
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,789
I see.

14
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,667
Well,

15
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,672
it'd be good to leave our bags
while we get water.

16
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,716
Since the water will be heavy.

17
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,722
You did that just to give her money.

18
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,017
You're too nice.
What if she steals everything?

19
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,811
We don't have anything worth stealing.

20
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,357
She even told us to take our money
and valuables with us.

21
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,775
<i>Let's trust her.</i>

22
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,860
100% SAFE WATER

23
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,237
Look.

24
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,282
Isn't this it? The underground entrance.

25
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,958
BICYCLE PARKING - OPEN 24 HOURS

26
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,635
It's water.

27
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,097
But isn't it just collecting here?

28
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,016
It doesn't look very clean.

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,396
SUBWAY

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,023
Someone's collapsed over there!

31
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,817
Maru! Don't jump
recklessly into the water!

32
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,126
That looks really bad.

33
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,670
Is he still alive?

34
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,754
My buddy…

35
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,048
Help my buddy.

36
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,678
It was a monster.

37
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:41,180
My buddy…

38
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,765
Help…

39
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,705
-That guy's a goner.
-Sis.

40
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:15,548
Run!

41
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,968
It worked.

42
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,639
It took an extra shot, but…

43
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,351
Look. It's out cold.

44
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:13,022
Once you know it's gonna chase you,
it's easy to come up with a plan.

45
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,067
Your quick thinking is really amazing.

46
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,571
Hurry up and kill it, Maru.

47
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,864
Oh, right.

48
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,200
All right.

49
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,578
Fatal Dive!

50
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:32,708
<i>Fatal Dive! Fatal Dive!</i>
<i>Fatal Dive! Fatal Dive!</i>

51
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,177
Why…

52
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,764
It's not a Hiruko! It's a wild animal!

53
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,975
What? No way!

54
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,060
Over there, Maru!

55
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,978
Sis, wait!

56
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,313
Here. Hurry up!

57
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,564
W-wait!

58
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:56,941
Climb up!

59
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,537
Good thing I managed to get up here.

60
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,710
It's a bear! A bear!

61
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,712
Can you imagine how that felt, Sis?

62
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,131
Just when I was thinking,

63
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,717
"Huh? It's not going in. That's weird."

64
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,720
I met the bear's eyes from this distance!

65
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,555
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

66
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,932
That guy said it was a monster!

67
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,226
Don't blame it on someone else!

68
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,729
That bear basically is a monster!

69
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,027
But it's a good thing it's a bear.
It can't climb up.

70
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,653
We'd be done for if it was a gorilla.

71
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,079
Not good.

72
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,290
It's getting cold.

73
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,710
Wait. Where did the bear go?

74
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,589
It kept walking around, but it's gone now.

75
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,424
Let's take the chance to get away.

76
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,431
If the fourth bullet fires,
I've got one shot left.

77
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,058
Will it shoot?

78
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,436
I'll warm up the battery.

79
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,816
Uh-oh.

80
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,610
What? "Uh-oh"?

81
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:25,946
Three choices.

82
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:29,033
One. I dropped the battery.

83
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,535
Two. Well--

84
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,330
That is--

85
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,165
What are you doing?

86
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,044
Geez, it really fell.

87
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,421
-Go get it.
-Stop joking.

88
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,757
What if the bear is still around?

89
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,677
Maru.

90
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,181
Do you see me as a woman? Or a man?

91
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,934
What? What's with that question?

92
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,481
Well, you look like a woman, so--

93
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:04,110
I guess that's probably
not what you want to hear, but…

94
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,194
Okay!

95
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,614
I'll let you touch my boobs
if you get it--

96
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,826
He jumped!

97
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,828
That idiot!

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,376
Maru!

99
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,003
There it is!

100
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,930
It was hiding and waiting
for us to come down.

101
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,890
It's definitely targeting us.

102
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,476
We can wait it out forever up here

103
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,396
or get down and shoot it
when it's in range.

104
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,772
Damn it.

105
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,191
Maru,

106
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:48,487
I managed to climb up
from the adrenaline rush,

107
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:51,032
but I can't climb down from here.

108
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,868
-What?
-No, see.

109
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,370
It's not normal to be as tough as you.

110
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,414
Normal people can't handle this height!

111
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,416
So Maru,

112
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,587
this time, go down with the Kiru-Beam
and kill the bear.

113
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,549
Then I'll use the dead bear as a cushion
and get down.

114
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,638
As long as it's not a Man-eater,
all you need is one shot to the head.

115
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,309
Let me tell you one thing, Sis.

116
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:23,230
Even if you give me the gun,
I can't shoot as accurately as you.

117
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:26,233
Am I that good of a shot?

118
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,027
Yeah, you're really good.

119
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,738
Normally, you can't shoot a power pole
while climbing a fence

120
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,783
or aim for the enemy's arm while running.

121
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,577
Am I helpful?

122
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,870
Of course you are.

123
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,081
I would've died five times already
without you.

124
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,169
Sis?

125
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,715
I'm help--

126
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,884
<i>I want to be helpful to Robin.</i>

127
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,638
<i>I'm not playing around!</i>
<i>I told you not to come. It's dangerous!</i>

128
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,889
<i>I'll drive it away.</i>

129
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,140
<i>I know I can do it.</i>

130
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,477
Okay!

131
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:03,854
Let's make a new plan.

132
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:11,570
<i>First, wait for the bear to get far away</i>
<i>while warming up our bodies.</i>

133
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,155
<i>And once it's far away?</i>

134
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:16,033
<i>Maru, you use that chance to get down.</i>

135
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,623
<i>I'll come down as soon as I hear you land.</i>

136
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,760
<i>Then you run as fast as you can</i>
<i>after catching me.</i>

137
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,806
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>What if the fourth shot doesn't fire?</i>

138
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,561
<i>If that happens…</i>

139
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,941
<i>I'll hold it off until you get away.</i>

140
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,137
Why didn't you get away?

141
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:23,309
You actually thought
I'd run away alone? That hurts.

142
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,478
And it was a flaw in your plan.

143
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:32,401
I was confident
the fourth shot would fire.

144
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,569
What?

145
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,573
The battery was charged
with your horny energy!

146
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,825
What the hell? Stop that!

147
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,162
Hey!

148
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,542
Iwata! Hang in there! Iwata!

149
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,505
-Boss.
-Shimomoto didn't make it.

150
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,589
Totori.

151
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,509
What about the people who saved Iwata?

152
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:01,180
They said their names weren't worth it
and left like the wind.

153
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,556
For real?

154
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,810
Who were they? The bear's head
was completely blown away.

155
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,436
HOTEL

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,481
-I wanted to meet them.
-Yeah.

157
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,067
To think there'd be a bear around here--

158
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,944
It's so nice animals aren't like Hiruko.

159
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,905
Their carcasses don't disappear
and we can eat them.

160
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:22,368
I'll tell you how we got tricked,
so you can keep it in mind.

161
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,661
We got tricked?

162
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:28,290
The vigilantes in the tent city
were also bandits.

163
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,670
We were completely lured
into their hunting grounds.

164
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,381
Lured?

165
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,758
100% safe water.

166
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,137
<i>I'm sure their plan was to block</i>

167
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,848
<i>the underground entrance</i>
<i>once we got close.</i>

168
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,643
That map-seller must've been in on it too.

169
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:51,355
Then we can't trust anything on the map.

170
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,191
It might not all be fake.

171
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,611
That's enough regretting. Let's sleep.

172
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,406
We're stuck here anyway.

173
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:02,992
What's wrong?

174
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:07,246
She gave us two rooms, so let's sleep
comfortably on our own.

175
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,708
Did you forget something?

176
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:16,672
Did you forget about your promise, Sis?

177
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,053
I risked my life, you know.

178
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,098
Let me touch your boobs.

179
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:29,435
{\an8}HOTEL

180
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:33,189
{\an8}My sister's hair was originally
black and straight.

181
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:37,068
It seems your hair can change

182
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,195
after undergoing surgery
for a major injury.

183
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:45,785
That's probably why I started growing
this red, dry hair.

184
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,788
But I think it's a curse from my sister.

185
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,417
Saying "Don't mess with my body!"

186
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,002
I see.

187
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:57,797
Now take off your jacket.

188
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:05,179
You sure?
Touching my boobs means this, you know.

189
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,516
If you still say it doesn't matter,
then I'll keep my promise.

190
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,477
Because it's a promise between men!

191
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,441
Wai-- Rules! Let's set some rules.

192
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:18,609
Like how many sec--

193
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,530
<i>That sounded just like a girl.</i>

194
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,616
Hey, you two.

195
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,454
PLEASE KEEP THE ROOMS CLEAN

196
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,041
{\an8}PLEASE DON'T DIRTY THE FUTON

197
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,545
This is not the place for doing that!

198
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,297
-You, come this way.
-Wait.

199
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,053
Sir,

200
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,932
how about me?

201
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:53,769
Eight hundred thousand.

202
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:56,188
Or that solar-powered light!

203
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:57,273
That will be enough.

204
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,900
So you did go through our stuff.

205
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,403
I didn't take anything,
so what's the problem?

206
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,321
So how about it?

207
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,532
Should I keep the bandana on?

208
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,953
Call me Totori. I don't know my last name.

209
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:12,788
Hey, I'm good.

210
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,915
Do you know what "no, thank you" means?

211
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,292
I prefer older girls--

212
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,184
You--

213
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,728
Sis! Get over here!

214
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,937
What're you doing?

215
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,814
Don't move.

216
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,191
Sis!

217
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,360
What's wrong, Maru?

218
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,112
-I got in!
-Ouch! It hurts!

219
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:50,201
What went in where?

220
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,418
What did you do?

221
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,962
No…

222
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,050
<i>After realizing</i>
<i>the difficulties of having to explain</i>

223
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,928
<i>the various misunderstandings</i>
<i>of this situation,</i>

224
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:13,432
<i>all Maru could see was</i>
<i>the dark depths of his despair.</i>

225
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,937
<i>There are no signs of an illness.</i>

226
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,191
Really? What a relief.

227
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:26,779
<i>You show signs of fatigue.</i>
<i>Please take a nap here.</i>

228
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,005
Who's there?

229
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,342
What?

230
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,395
Asura?

231
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,651
What are you good at, Tokio?

232
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,946
What do you mean?

233
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:15,828
It disappeared.

234
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,461
What? My leg is--

235
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,380
Doctor! Doctor!

236
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,555
A dream?

237
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:40,936
How are you feeling?

238
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:43,147
I'm fine.

239
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:49,070
DON'T COME IN

240
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,447
We are really sorry!

241
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,699
My heaven is right here.

242
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,744
I will take full responsibility.
Please forgive me.

243
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:01,040
Well, I don't mind
if we continue chatting like this.

244
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,250
But you look so pitiful,
so let's stop here.

245
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,213
You didn't do anything wrong.
I was the one who came on to you.

246
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,590
Thank you!

247
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:11,217
TOTORI'S HOTEL

248
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,346
Even if you ask me what I am,
I'm just your average orphan.

249
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:20,101
I can only remember being raised
by those vigilantes.

250
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:24,021
So you were born after the Great Disaster,
and raised as an orphan?

251
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,857
But your parents could be alive somewhere.

252
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,277
It's not like I want to look for them.
Or meet them.

253
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,115
I've realized something.

254
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,450
Anything that feels good makes money.

255
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,413
I'll earn money by getting
more clean rooms and futons.

256
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:43,666
I'll have sex with the customers I like,

257
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,168
and become the King of Hotels!

258
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,259
I don't get why I can enter a human.

259
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,637
But good thing I cleared up
that misunderstanding.

260
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:01,100
I thought the only way
I was gonna get you to believe me,

261
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,269
was by killing her with the Maru-Touch.

262
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,397
Oh, yeah?
Wasn't it the Whatchamacallit Dive?

263
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,607
Forget that ever happened!

264
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:12,778
I knew it was bad the second I said it.

265
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:15,281
I remember now. Fatal Dive.

266
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,033
I told you to forget it!

267
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,077
HOTEL

268
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,080
Well, see ya.

269
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:24,874
The futon was really comfortable.

270
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,377
What's up? You don't look too good.

271
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,463
What happened to all that energy
from last night?

272
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,799
They said the Boss didn't make it.

273
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,261
He died early in the morning.

274
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,764
Even though you saved him.

275
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,769
He was so tough.
I didn't think he would die.

276
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,856
He was a good boss. So kind to us.

277
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:53,361
Well, dying is a part of life.

278
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,574
Want to join us?

279
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:05,206
Okay.

280
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:12,797
Then be the King of Hotels.

281
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,557
Even a guy like that
was important to somebody.

282
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:28,938
If I was born and raised in this area,

283
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,941
I might've been one of his guys.

284
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,233
You look better today.

285
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,112
I was worried about something,
but it's all better now.

286
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:43,406
That's good.

287
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,334
DETECTING DETAILED POINTS

288
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,586
COMPARISON IN PROGRESS
INSPECTION COMPLETE

289
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,213
FEATURES - 92% MATCH
OBJECTS APPEAR IDENTICAL

290
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:01,674
I found it. This is it.

291
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,511
The footprint in this room is…

292
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,513
Tokio's.

293
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,017
But how? Without anyone noticing?

294
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:16,814
I saw Asura's ghost today.

295
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,108
Ghost?

296
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,318
But it might have been a dream.

297
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,739
You liked Asura, right?

298
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:26,407
Yeah.

299
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:32,955
But it's different to my love for you.

300
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,082
You know that, right?

301
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:38,753
Yeah.

302
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:39,837
