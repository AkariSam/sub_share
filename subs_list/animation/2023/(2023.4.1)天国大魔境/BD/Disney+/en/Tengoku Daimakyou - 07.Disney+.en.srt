00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,165

EDION

4
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,726
Hey, is this how you spell "Man-eaters"?

5
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,852
WEE KIL MANN-EETERS

6
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,606
You're asking as if
the rest of the words are spelled right.

7
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,484
Let me write it.

8
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,902
{\an8}CREDIT CARD LOAN - PARKING LOT

9
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,655
{\an8}Why can I never write
even though I can read fine?

10
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,240
I know, right?

11
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,741
WE KILL

12
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,826
There.

13
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,621
You have to put "Man-eaters"
on a new line, or it'll look bad.

14
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,331
How come?

15
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,416
HANDY

16
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,209
<i>On my office door in Nakano,</i>

17
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>it looked as if I killed and ate men.</i>

18
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,130
I KILL MAN-EATERS

19
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,549
<i>Then there was actually a murder in town.</i>

20
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,884
<i>Everyone suspected me</i>
<i>and came storming over.</i>

21
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,015
Seems to me people get blindly aggressive
about stuff they don't understand.

22
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,183
WE KILL MAN-EATS

23
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,103
I messed up because I was talking!

24
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,106
Now it says "Man-eats."

25
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,942
You're making it sound like it's my fault.

26
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,862
I'll rewrite it on the other side.

27
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:38,324
You should include the other names
so it's easy to understand. Like Hiruko.

28
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,326
You're the only one who calls them that!

29
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,704
Mikura called them that too.

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,583
THE IMMORTAL ORDER

31
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,796
WE KILL MAN-EATERS, MONSTERS,
MUTANT BEASTS (AND HIRUKO)

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,214
{\an8}TWO MILLION YEN EACH

00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,216
{\an8}FOR BEGINNERS!
INTRO TO RIVER FISHING

34
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,970
I hope someone snaps up our offer quickly.

35
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,724
Since they call themselves an order,

36
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:07,645
I thought once we got to the area, there'd
be a flag or sign on an obvious building.

37
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,608
If it's this quiet,
how are we supposed to find them?

38
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,905
I got one! Maru, the net!

39
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,239
Wait a sec!

40
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,629
What's with the mysterious face?
Thinking about something?

41
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,255
The King of Hotels?

42
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,883
No.

43
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,137
There's an odd number of fish,
and they're all different sizes.

44
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,598
I was wondering how
we're gonna divide them up.

45
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,143
What's wrong, Sis?

46
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,149
You look so good when you're quiet.

47
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,235
But you ruin it
as soon as you open your mouth.

48
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,320
Wait! Let me try again.

49
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,074
-Ready.
-No, it's totally different.

50
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,784
Wait, one more try!

51
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,370
No way, you blew your chance!

52
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,379
Hey, there's a weird pair
at the end of the road.

53
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,131
They're not from that group, are they?

54
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,925
You should probably report it.

55
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,521
Dr. Usami.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,941
What is it?

57
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:40,071
A couple of people
are loitering around with a strange sign.

58
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:44,034
It says something about being able to kill
Man-eaters and monsters.

59
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,244
They might be roaming bodyguards.

60
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,208
Bring them to me.

61
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,920
Right, of course.

62
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,306
Looks like we've made another catch.

63
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,644
This way, please.

64
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,897
{\an8}Watch your step.

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,317
STOP HUMAN EXPERIMENTS

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,735
FREE THE PATIENTS

67
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,285
This place…

68
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,624
So, we have some business
with the Immortal Order.

69
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,542
What kind of business?

70
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,044
If you've come for treatment,

71
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,880
you shouldn't think of it
as any ordinary hospital.

72
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,510
I'm here to see the doctor
who offers the treatment.

73
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,595
He's an old acquaintance of mine.

74
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,973
That's not Dr. Usami.

75
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,351
Maybe he's a new doctor.

76
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,523
Are you people
not from the Immortal Order?

77
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,025
What? No!

78
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,194
What?

79
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,988
Where'd they go?

80
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,116
We lost them.

81
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,369
-This is a waste of time.
-Wait, don't go!

82
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,579
At least hear us out!

83
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,460
Our group is opposed to the ways
of the Immortal Order.

84
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,670
We are called Liviuman.

85
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,380
I am their leader, Mizuhashi.

86
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,717
We saw the sign that you made.

87
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,053
So we brought you here to discuss it.

88
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,847
Hold on a second.

89
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,392
First things first, we basically have
no idea what the Immortal Order is.

90
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,477
Are they running
some kind of free hospital?

91
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,897
It may look like a hospital,

92
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,817
but, please, take a look.

93
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,612
It must have been about a year ago.

94
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,575
I had an injury and went to
the Order for treatment.

95
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,911
But, in the end, they restrained me
and amputated my leg.

96
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,624
Then they attached this metal leg.

97
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,503
We thought it was one
of Dr. Usami's human experiments.

98
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,050
Even now, people come from all over
to have their injuries cured.

99
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,510
But, instead, they are
subjected to the work of the devil,

100
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,596
and their body parts
are replaced with machines.

101
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,724
That's what the Immortal Order is.

102
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,311
But since it's called an order,
they must have followers

103
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,855
and people who don't complain
about the treatments, right?

104
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,732
Even before the Collapse,

105
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,903
machines were used to replace
body parts that had deteriorated.

106
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,783
This led to the idea that the brain,
or its memory data,

107
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,370
could be transplanted into a robot's body,
thus transcending mortality itself.

108
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,663
From an ethical viewpoint,

109
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,958
it wasn't possible to actually
carry out anything that radical.

110
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,252
But now we live in a lawless world.

111
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,798
If there are doctors
willing to take their research that far,

112
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,301
then there are probably people
who would happily become machines.

113
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,053
I bet you're thinking,

114
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,139
"Why not let those
who want to be involved get on with it?"

115
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,352
Or, "Isn't it your fault for going there
without knowing what you were in for?"

116
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,271
I suppose that's what you think.

117
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,273
It's not that…

118
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,526
I understand.

119
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,821
You're probably wondering why
I speak out against their ways.

120
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,950
But I have seen it.

121
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,578
<i>The repulsive reality.</i>

122
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,435
Behind a curtain,

123
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,770
I saw a body completely chopped to pieces,

124
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,815
hacked up to a point
that ought to be beyond survival.

125
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,944
A human being kept alive
by an impossible number of machines.

126
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,656
<i>When it noticed my presence,</i>

127
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,075
<i>it spoke to me.</i>

128
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,078
Let…

129
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,331
Let me die.

130
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,293
Even more shockingly,

131
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:08,089
that mass of machines, which has trampled
on any remaining human dignity,

132
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,551
appears to be
an object of worship for them.

133
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,430
So we decided to do something about it.

134
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,309
<i>Dr. Usami has gained followers</i>

135
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,520
<i>from the knowledge he has acquired</i>
<i>with his inhumane acts.</i>

136
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,482
<i>It's possible that in this era,</i>

137
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,610
<i>their way of doing things</i>
<i>will become the dominant one.</i>

138
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,363
So this guy isn't Dr. Usami?

139
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,947
That's not him.

140
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,991
Usami is younger.

141
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,577
Right.

142
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,081
We heard that the Immortal Order

143
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,792
are transplanting parts of the Man-eaters
onto human bodies.

144
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,168
What?

145
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,129
Really? So that's what they're doing.

146
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,510
That's connected to
what I wanted to discuss with you.

147
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,681
<i>It seems that the Immortal Order</i>

148
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,726
<i>is keeping a Man-eater in the basement</i>
<i>of their building.</i>

149
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,280
What are we going to do, Sis?
Shall we do it?

150
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,408
Let's do it.

151
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,493
They said they'd pay us.

152
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,955
If a Man-eater can be killed, we kill it.

153
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,957
People are going to get eaten if we don't.

154
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,333
That much is certain.

155
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,670
If you say so, then I will, but…

156
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,132
But what?

157
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,176
You're not as coolheaded as usual.

158
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,346
You're turning into Haruki again.

159
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,889
What's that supposed to mean?

160
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,726
I've always been Haruki in my head.

161
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,060
I am coolheaded.

162
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,824
She was naked.

163
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,327
No, no, stop it.

164
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,039
<i>From Sis's point of view,</i>

165
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,460
<i>it's possible the doctor we're chasing</i>
<i>is part of the Immortal Order,</i>

166
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,088
<i>which might bring us closer to the reason</i>
<i>why the woman she loved died.</i>

167
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,924
<i>No wonder it's hard to keep cool.</i>

168
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,596
<i>But something doesn't feel right.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>

169
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,725
<i>I need to figure it out.</i>

170
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:32,067
<i>Perfect. Being squished so close,</i>
<i>I can only think of irrelevant stuff.</i>

171
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,655
As many of you already know,

172
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,201
this morning
another large building collapsed.

173
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:46,247
Day by day, the civilization that we knew
is returning to the earth.

174
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,708
It is useless to us now.

175
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,796
Those of us who remain don't have
the power to rebuild what is left.

176
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,132
What did machines bring to humanity?

177
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,009
Tanks! Bombs!

178
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,511
Fighter planes!

179
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,807
What did we get in return for this poison?
Electricity! Convenience!

180
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,227
What we are left with, as a result,
is an endless winter

181
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,563
and a mountain of debris
just rotting away.

182
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,565
-Yeah!
-Exactly!

183
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,984
This kind of thing

184
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,903
is not needed!

185
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,031
-Our leader!
-Ms. Mizuhashi!

186
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,116
Are you okay?

187
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,952
We don't need machines.

188
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,955
We don't need machines!

189
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,540
-No machines!
-No machines!

190
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,291
BANK OF JAPAN NOTE
TEN-THOUSAND YEN

191
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,548
It's getting really crazy out there.

192
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,177
All we can do right now
is rant and rave outside their building.

193
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,723
But if we get rid of that monster,
we can have a discussion on equal terms.

194
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,058
A discussion, huh?

195
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,146
They could release that monster anytime.
While they have that secret weapon,

196
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,524
the Order is not going to listen to us.

197
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,945
Well, we're only being paid to kill it.

198
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,197
After that, you can do what you like.

199
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,326
<i>Fine. So, as for today's plans…</i>

200
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:10,957
{\an8}RESTORE HUMAN RIGHTS

201
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,710
{\an8}Stop human experiments!

202
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,794
{\an8}FREE THE PATIENTS!!

203
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,547
{\an8}<i>Now, they're demonstrating</i>
<i>against human experimentation</i>

204
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,175
<i>outside the Immortal Order's building.</i>

205
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,136
<i>But it's a diversion.</i>

206
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,973
<i>We'll use it to get you to the basement</i>
<i>through another entrance.</i>

207
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,850
<i>There's no guard?</i>

208
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,062
<i>The guard to the basement</i>
<i>is one of our own.</i>

209
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,147
I've heard the plan.

210
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,613
We're counting on you.

211
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,182
It's so bright.

212
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,725
The lights are on.

213
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,145
They must have
some serious power generators.

214
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,900
All that talk of life-support systems
is starting to sound more credible.

215
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,030
But it's weird, isn't it?

216
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:28,576
There's no sign of a Man-eater here.
Not a single sound.

217
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,622
Sis?

218
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,544
I've had a weird feeling for a while.

219
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,879
I think I just got what it is.

220
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,635
It feels like we're being set up.
Just like when we went to find the water.

221
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,638
What if there are no Hiruko here?

222
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,808
If there were Hiruko in this basement,

223
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,603
<i>then why would that old guy</i>
<i>who wanted a transplant</i>

224
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,314
<i>go to all that trouble</i>
<i>looking for Hiruko parts?</i>

225
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,150
No, but…

226
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,737
No, wait.

227
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,155
What you're saying makes sense,

228
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,034
but that guy probably
has never been to the Immortal Order.

229
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,328
It's pretty likely
he was on a wild chase after some rumor.

230
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,042
If they just wanted to lock us up in here,
that plan seems way over-the-top.

231
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,002
Why would they do all this?

232
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,670
To use us for experiments!

233
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,341
If we don't escape, they'll chop us up
and keep us alive like that forever!

234
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,430
<i>They could use</i>
<i>a gas heavier than air to put us to sleep.</i>

235
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,682
<i>Is that why we're in the basement?</i>

236
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,560
This is way too risky, Sis.
Let's get outta here!

237
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,270
Wait!

238
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,483
What is that?

239
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:51,451
Is it a dormant Man-eater?

240
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,581
Yeah, it's a Hiruko.

241
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,167
Crushed it.

242
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,632
It's weird that I'm glad
there was a Man-eater here,

243
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,676
but looks like
you were worried about nothing.

244
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,511
Right.

245
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,930
Wha-- Sis!

246
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,140
Isn't that one down there too?

247
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,935
Another? What the hell?

248
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,770
I thought there was only one.

249
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,231
There could be more.
We need to cover every corner.

250
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,824
The fact that they're not moving

251
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,119
is actually more annoying.

252
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,001
Got you.

253
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,211
Is this guy the big boss?

254
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,714
Gross.

255
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,217
Did those little ones
multiply from this guy?

256
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,220
But why are they frozen stiff?

257
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,182
When a Man-eater is on the verge of death,
it enters a state of suspended animation.

258
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,309
They survive by playing dead.

259
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:03,023
These ones probably haven't had any food
since being trapped down here.

260
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,067
Right. Food…

261
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,112
And now that two humans have shown up,

262
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,656
I guess they'll start to wake up?

263
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,040
There!

264
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,250
Sis!

265
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,002
There's a little one that's moving!

266
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,837
I don't know if I got it.

267
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,714
Where'd you go?

268
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,677
No.

269
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,930
They've got quick moves. Watch out!

270
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,184
No way.

271
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,103
They're slipping through the walls.

272
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,736
Damn it, get off!

273
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,363
Maru, run!

274
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,031
Maru!

275
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,873
Go to hell!

276
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:10,757
This can't be happening.

277
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,218
Die!

278
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,345
Just die already!

279
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,223
Let me go!

280
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,209
Help.

281
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,628
Help me, Robin!

282
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,470
<i>It's over.</i>

283
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,681
<i>I can't…</i>

284
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,476
<i>breathe.</i>

285
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,409
You're okay.

286
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,703
There's nothing here. Nothing happened!

287
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,624
Was I dreaming?

288
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,836
That's impossible.
Did it make me hallucinate?

289
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,672
Thank God. You're back to reality.

290
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,176
I don't know what I'd have done
if you'd stayed like that.

291
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,472
You just started shooting at nothing
and flailing violently out of nowhere.

292
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,350
Just rest like that for a bit.

293
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,769
I'll deal with the rest of the Hiruko.

294
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,023
Hey, Sis?

295
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,027
I guess you wanted Robin to save you.

296
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,612
What?

297
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,492
Sorry, I thought they'd already got you.

298
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,377
<i>Damn it.</i>

299
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,296
<i>What kind of guy says something so stupid?</i>

300
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,132
<i>Why exactly should I be apologizing?</i>

301
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,729
I think that's all of them.

302
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,148
Are you feeling better, Sis?

303
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,733
Yeah.

304
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,445
When you were staring at that huge Hiruko,

305
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,906
it must have hypnotized you.
I'm sure of it.

306
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,910
That's why I told you
you weren't as coolheaded as usual.

307
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,790
I'll try and focus more.

308
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,967
-Hey!
-Ouch.

309
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,469
As if you're trying
to sneak another one in!

310
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,971
Are you stupid?

311
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,224
Someone's coming.

312
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,074
Is it dead?

313
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,868
Really?

314
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,291
This guy's clearly bad news.

315
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,924
There's someone else I want you to kill.

316
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,638
Someone I want you to help.

317
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,684
If we can.

318
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,729
I mean, it depends on what you're asking.

319
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,398
Aren't you from the Immortal Order?

320
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,485
I don't remember
ever referring to it that way,

321
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,779
but I've heard it called that before.

322
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,073
Right.

323
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,659
So, is Dr. Usami here? We want to see him.

324
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,079
Usami?

325
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,455
That's me.
