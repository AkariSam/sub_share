{\an8}TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,165
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

3
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:40,935
No more human experiments!

4
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,771
Cutting off a leg
just for your experiments

5
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,356
isn't something a human would do!

6
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,649
{\an8}FREE THE PATIENTS
STOP HUMAN EXPERIMENTS

7
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,068
-No more human experiments!
-That's right!

8
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,245
That bastard!
Well, let's do it right here!

9
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,340
Miss Mizuhashi!

10
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,011
That's foul! Violence is wrong!

11
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,097
-Violence is wrong!
-No violence!

12
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,850
One rock, and all hell breaks loose.

13
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,894
They are just a group
of revelers with no beliefs.

14
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,648
No, they are acting strangely today.

15
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,943
I thought they'd be emotional for a while.

16
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,237
I can't believe
they left after just one rock.

17
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,533
It's like it served another purpose.

18
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,162
Yeah. They're going to use this rock
as an excuse to do anything.

19
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,539
They may demand something.

20
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,250
Even though they threw the stone first?

21
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,294
Hmm?

22
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:52,381
They're the ones who think
"what we do is an expression of what we do

23
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,508
and what others do is an attack."

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,137
-Leader!
-Are you okay?

25
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,140
-Leader!
-Leader!

26
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,516
Excuse me.

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,809
Let me through!

28
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,655
I was able to confirm
from the guard on watch.

29
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,159
He said the monsters
in the basement are really dead.

30
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:25,498
We must not miss this chance!

31
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,834
Listen up, everyone.

32
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,088
The leader

33
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,714
is dead.

34
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,724
The leader was subjected
to inhumane experimentation

35
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,309
and had her leg cut off.

36
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,021
And yet, she still stood up
to save the test subject

37
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,691
held captive by the Immortal Order.

38
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,236
Defeat the enemies of the leader!

39
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,154
Grab your weapons!

40
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,034
Hey, hey.

41
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,173
Doctor!

42
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:19,301
Doctor, my prosthetic hand
is making strange noises.

43
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:27,143
You can ask someone
to spray it with oil or silicone spray.

44
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,396
Just this one place is enough.

45
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:36,444
Doctor, this child doesn't know
how to control the strength.

46
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,320
Can't you do something about it?

47
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,948
You get used to it.
You just have to get used to it.

48
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,117
-Doctor!
-Dr. Usami.

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,201
Let's go.

50
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,245
Is it okay?

51
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,205
There is no end to it.

52
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,667
In here.

53
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:57,089
I want you to see if you can make her die
using the same method you used

54
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,008
to kill the monsters in the basement.

55
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,639
This is…

56
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,102
the curtain that Mizuhashi mentioned.

57
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,025
Th-They say

58
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,780
it's the cornerstone
of their patients' treatment.

59
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,208
Why don't you just turn off the machines
if you want to let her die?

60
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,796
If I did, she'll become a monster
like the ones in the basement.

61
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:41,801
She's going to become a Man-eater?

62
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,304
Are Man-eaters human?

63
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:50,351
If you ask me if they are human,
they are a little different.

64
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,937
They are former humans
who died from a disease

65
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,064
that turns them into monsters.

66
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:59,944
The facilities here were created
to prolong her life as a human

67
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,196
after she developed that disease.

68
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,241
To slow the progression,

69
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:09,745
you have to cut out
the part of the body that is diseased.

70
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,501
Still, once it develops,

71
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,045
you will eventually relapse.

72
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,923
And the diseased parts
will need to be removed again.

73
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,593
If the body can no longer function,
it is supplemented by the machines.

74
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,514
I've been doing all this for a long time.

75
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:33,310
But her body has reached its limit.

76
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,399
She may be able to die as a human

77
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,486
with the method you used
to kill the monsters in the basement.

78
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,326
It's our only hope.

79
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,106
I can do it.

80
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,818
You can?

81
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,987
But what does she want?

82
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,366
She can communicate through that tablet.

83
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,869
And she can hear us.

84
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,632
I WANT

85
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,134
I WANT TO SEE

86
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:50,388
THE SKY ONE LAST TIME

87
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,436
Can she be taken outside?

88
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,855
She can't be removed from the machines.

89
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,613
From here.

90
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:13,911
To here.

91
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,247
It's only this far.

92
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,293
We'll help you.

93
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,380
If you can't do that,
I won't do it either.

94
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,055
Good. That's right. Softly.

95
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,390
Softly.

96
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,854
-Place that close to her.
-Got it.

97
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,315
Put this by her side as well.

98
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:47,737
Looks like I need to extend this.

99
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,698
I need you to get into her line of sight

100
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,784
because she won't be able
to hear anything for a moment.

101
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,392
THAT HURTS! YOU IDIOT!

102
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,186
Sorry, sorry.

103
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,688
Calling me an idiot…

104
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,948
All the stairs are blocked!

105
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:34,742
-Go around!
-Let's go!

106
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:35,826
Geez.

107
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,455
<i>The time has come.</i>

108
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:41,957
Hey!

109
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,169
The gen--

110
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:01,519
It's retribution
for killing Miss Mizuhashi!

111
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,938
Yeah!

112
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,273
Gotta do what must be done!

113
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,192
Rush in through here!

114
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:10,736
This is bad!

115
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,365
The Whiteshirts just showed up,
armed to the teeth!

116
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,244
Damn. I thought
they weren't going to be violent.

117
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:24,083
Everyone move upstairs!
Those who can move, assist the wounded!

118
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,402
Hey, it's kind of noisy.

119
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,279
Just leave it alone.

120
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,075
That room's a decoy! Watch out for it!

121
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,525
It might've been easier
just to let her turn into a monster.

122
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,949
I've made her suffer for a long time.

123
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,713
Maru, Maru. Look at this.

124
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:24,055
Usami, look at this.

125
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:42,323
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME DIE
AS A HUMAN

126
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,703
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME YOUR EYE

127
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,997
{\an8}THANK YOU

128
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:57,004
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

129
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:05,596
I LOVE YOU

130
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:42,633
Is everyone here? Anyone else hurt?

131
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:45,553
Naito was the first to jump out at them.

132
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,054
Damn it.

133
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,766
Doctor!

134
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:53,019
You're unharmed.

135
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,647
They said something
about Mizuhashi's death and broke in.

136
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,399
We need to regain power immediately.

137
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,859
Or Miss Hoshio will…

138
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,907
She's already dead.

139
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:07,992
Oh.

140
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,997
Don't tell me they…

141
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:18,461
No, she died a natural death.

142
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,801
There should be a settlement here.

143
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,763
Can you make it there
before the sun goes down?

144
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,140
What about you, Doctor?
You're not coming with us?

145
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:36,020
I'll follow you with the guards
after giving her a burial.

146
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,855
Go first without me.

147
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,904
Why do we have to get chased out
of where we live?

148
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,741
Because I killed monsters in the basement.

149
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,452
That's why this happened, isn't it?

150
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,081
-Maru--
-It doesn't matter.

151
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:02,046
Almost all the facilities
in that building were made for her.

152
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,215
They're no longer necessary.

153
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,341
There are still wounded.

154
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,678
There's a lot of people
who want to be treated by you.

155
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,557
We were originally
two people living together.

156
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,227
An injured man wandered into the house.

157
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,063
I made him a prosthetic hand on a whim.

158
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,816
Before I knew it,
more and more people arrived.

159
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,070
Oh, yes.

160
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:32,743
<i>It makes her happy when I make things.</i>

161
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,206
That's why I made it.

162
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,042
That's why.

163
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,921
I am not a doctor.

164
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,804
Wonderful.

165
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:55,016
I've got the future in my hands.

166
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,643
With this many power generators,

167
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:59,478
we can build a city here.

168
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:03,357
A new culture

169
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,693
in this broken world!

170
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:11,532
<i>All we need now is</i>
<i>one order and leadership.</i>

171
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,367
<i>A nation.</i>

172
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,287
<i>This is the end of childish factions.</i>

173
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,789
<i>We start here!</i>

174
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,555
Excuse me, everyone.

175
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,351
Sorry to bother you
at this difficult time.

176
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,394
Have you seen these two?

177
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,605
This one is a doctor.

178
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,857
I don't know.

179
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,028
This forehead scar is something
I'd remember if I saw it once.

180
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:52,448
In the three years I've been
with the Doctor, I've never seen him.

181
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:57,703
This good-looking guy?
Isn't this Dr. Inazaki?

182
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:00,039
What?

183
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,834
Oh, yes! This is Dr. Inazaki.

184
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:07,838
It was long before the Whiteshirts
started messing around.

185
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,632
So, about two years ago.

186
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,467
One day, without saying a word,

187
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,928
he was just gone.

188
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,848
He had surgical knowledge
and was studying Dr. Usami's technique.

189
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,018
He said he's not going
to let anyone else die.

190
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,895
He was an enthusiastic man.

191
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,481
It's Robin.

192
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,611
<i>It's definitely Robin.</i>
<i>I knew you were alive.</i>

193
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:32,780
<i>I want to see you!</i>

194
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,573
<i>I have to!</i>

195
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,159
Sis.

196
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,040
Are you going to guard Usami?

197
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,458
Oh.

198
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:48,879
Oh, it's just the way things went.

199
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,467
-You also want to know about Robin.
-Wha--

200
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:55,970
Of course I'll ask about him.

201
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,179
Okay, okay.

202
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,105
Isn't Usami done yet?

203
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,036
What--

204
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,623
Damn it.

205
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,503
Maru?

206
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,260
{\an8}I'm the total opposite of Usami and Robin.

207
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:02,847
My hands…

208
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:06,767
bring only death!

209
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,188
Idiot!

210
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,775
Don't say that.

211
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:18,362
{\an8}Don't you dare say that.

212
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,324
When you kill Man-eaters,

213
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:24,076
people won't be eaten anymore.

214
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:26,704
You're saving everyone's life!

215
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,463
THEIR CHOICES

216
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,727
I wonder where I am.

217
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:34,647
It's dark.

218
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:38,859
Somehow

219
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:41,195
I hate it.

220
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:49,620
It's scary.

221
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,174
You came!

222
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:06,345
Well, then.

223
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:09,056
It's not scary.

224
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,070
Why are you grinning all by yourself?

225
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:27,366
I don't know.

226
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,453
I had a dream that made me happy.

227
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,663
What kind?

228
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,878
I don't remember anymore.
