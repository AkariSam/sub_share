1
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,215
A Man-eater.

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,552
Great. Better tell everyone quickly!

3
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,305
-Captain!
-Don't barge in--

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:15,850
A Man-eater's attacking the ship!
We need to go faster!

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,184
What'd you say?

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,603
Sis, it's here!

7
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,233
Eat this!

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,156
Take that!

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,538
Seriously?

10
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,161
{\an8}TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

11
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,205
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

12
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,182
No one saw you, right?

13
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,767
Yup.

14
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,062
Then let's go! To see the babies!

15
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,365
Here it is!

16
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,075
Here?

17
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:40,327
-Follow me.
-Huh?

18
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,871
What?

19
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,588
We're going in through here!

20
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,267
How am I supposed to do that?

21
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,643
KUKU

22
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,863
Hey, did you hear that noise?

23
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,074
I think so.

24
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,868
-Okay, watch this!
-Quit it, you'll get hurt.

25
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,495
Here goes.

26
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,499
<i>Abnormal behavior detected.</i>

27
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,126
Taka's always full of energy.

28
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,924
<i>Close contact</i>
<i>of more than ten seconds confirmed.</i>

29
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,884
Nanaki and Iwa again?

30
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,096
I wonder what possessed them
to kiss each other.

31
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,014
It's quite strange.

32
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,684
We've never taught them that behavior.

33
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:45,893
-Huh?
-Huh?

34
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,896
<i>Possible deterioration in health detected.</i>

35
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,774
Medical team,
confirm Tarao's condition immediately.

36
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,110
<i>The nurse is currently with him.</i>

37
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,528
We're on our way.

38
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,321
Here, stick onto the wall.

39
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,741
Okay. Go up.

40
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,495
What a good idea, Tokio!

41
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,997
This was Taka's idea.

42
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,088
Let's go, Tokio!

43
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,386
Let's look for it.

44
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,847
Okay then…

45
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,266
Tokio!

46
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,976
Hurry up.

47
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,060
Right.

48
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,608
<i>Am I going outside of the outside?</i>

49
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,159
We're dead if it gets inside!

50
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,620
Can't you shoot it away again?

51
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:50,249
Then we can go and close all of the doors.

52
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,044
I can't. I'm out of bullets.

53
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:56,756
Don't know if the ship's
lopsided or rusted,

54
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,966
but there's a door that won't budge.

55
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,470
Then the only thing we can do
is barricade ourselves in here.

56
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,555
How long until we reach the shore?

57
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,640
Thirty minutes at top speed.

58
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,434
Will it hold?

59
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,315
Probably not.

60
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,360
Sis.

61
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:22,782
From what I've seen,
the fish uses those suction cup hands

62
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:27,661
and a suit of water covering its body
as a lubricant to move on land.

63
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,082
It relies on the water suit to attack
and move around.

64
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,168
Where's the best place to fight it?

65
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,296
Somewhere it can't get water. On land?

66
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,341
Better if it's somewhere like a maze.

67
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,927
Since it attacks and moves
only in straight lines.

68
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,346
We'll fight it inside the ship.

69
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,847
Inside the ship?

70
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,351
Hey! There's a door downstairs, right?

71
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,019
Give me the key.

72
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,020
DO NOT ENTER

73
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,146
Why?

74
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,940
If you don't want to die, give it to me!

75
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,025
-It ain't locked!
-Eh?

76
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,861
Ain't never been locked.

77
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,905
He said it ain't locked.

78
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,199
Okay.

79
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,411
Sis, wait!

80
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,496
How are we going to fight
without the Kiru-Beam?

81
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,289
We have the Maru-Touch.

82
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,043
And that is?

83
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,463
-You're going to kill it by touching it.
-What?

84
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,052
Wait, you got no plan?

85
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:33,185
Hey! Over here! Come and get me!

86
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,445
Here-- Here it comes!

87
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,031
Scary!

88
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,244
Damn, the boxes!

89
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,746
Hurry and climb over!

90
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,136
What an idiot! Dumb shot!

91
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,222
Sis, it's open!

92
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,727
If you don't open both sides,
the fish can't get in!

93
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,687
It doesn't need to come in!

94
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,190
-Yes, it does!
-Huh?

95
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,818
It's all boxes here too.

96
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,195
Just get over there!

97
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,282
Damn! This isn't the best situation
to come up with a plan!

98
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,584
A door!

99
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,923
The door won't open. No way!

100
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,557
Maru, you don't need to open it.

101
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,269
Sis, it's no good. It won't open.

102
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,314
-I said it's okay.
-Why?

103
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,239
What's happening to it?

104
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,035
There should've been a ton of marijuana
on this ship,

105
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,205
but there were only vegetables upstairs.

106
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:22,378
I thought there'd be
boxes of marijuana in this locked room.

107
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:27,425
With all the boxes and dried marijuana
sucking up the water,

108
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,303
this guy's just a fish out of water.

109
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:37,935
We won.

110
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,651
Looks fine. Go kill it.

111
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,821
Beating it without the Kiru-Beam…

112
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,907
You can't just look at the opponent
in these situations.

113
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,787
You'll win if you stay calm
and look at your surroundings.

114
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,250
That's how I've survived.

115
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,087
Anyway, it's horrible.

116
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:10,634
I can live with "Kiru-Beam,"
but "Maru-Touch" is just awful.

117
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:14,638
-What're you talking about?
-The stupid way you name things!

118
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,436
It's pitch black now.

119
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,521
We're almost there. See?

120
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,778
Okay. Nobody's around.

121
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,446
Someone's in there sometimes?

122
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,533
The Director, and adults I've never met.

123
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,795
Are we outside the school? Inside?

124
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:46,879
Look!

125
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,507
Real live babies.

126
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:57,973
Those are…

127
00:09:58,974 --> 00:09:59,975
babies?

128
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,794
<i>Intruder detected.</i>

129
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,213
-<i>Intruder detected.</i>
-Tokio!

130
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,882
<i>The sanctum. The sanctum.</i>

131
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,978
<i>Intruder detected. Intruder detected.</i>

132
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,062
INCUBATOR ROOM 1

133
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,272
<i>The sanctum.</i>

134
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,315
What is this alert?

135
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,400
SANCTUM

136
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,235
I'm not sure.
It's my first time hearing it.

137
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,571
-It said intruder.
-First, let's go in and see.

138
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:13,758
What is this fuss?

139
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,094
There was an intruder alert here!

140
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,389
I also heard it.

141
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,475
We will confirm it right now.

142
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,479
-<i>Monitor Room.</i>
-We're looking into it, but…

143
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,106
There's no sign of any intruder.

144
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:33,611
We'll continue our search,
but it's most likely an error.

145
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,948
They didn't find us?

146
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,534
Tokio! Come on!

147
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,464
Hurry.

148
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,760
Tokio!

149
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,605
To-ki-o.

150
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,568
Okay, Mina.

151
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:17,530
<i>Yes.</i>

152
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:22,034
Do you know anything about that alert?

153
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:24,537
Isn't this place like a part of your body?

154
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:29,375
<i>If a human had a health inspection,</i>

155
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,586
<i>and received a report</i>
<i>for "further examination required,"</i>

156
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,341
<i>could that human identify where there was</i>
<i>something wrong in their body?</i>

157
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,178
I surrender, Mina. You win.

158
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,396
Hold up!

159
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:57,028
You buggers! Where are you going
after messing up our cargo?

160
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,284
If you hadn't been there,
the whole ship would've been lost.

161
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,704
You're our saviors. Thank you!

162
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:10,124
This is payment
for the monster extermination.

163
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,294
We would've been killed
if we hadn't fought back,

164
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,755
so we can't take this.

165
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:19,884
In exchange, tell us about this area.

166
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,469
Well…

167
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,975
If you keep walking down this big road,

168
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,227
you'll see a kind of town.

169
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,854
Really?

170
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:35,566
Oh, yeah. Do you know anything
about this logo?

171
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,822
Logos using birds
have been around for ages,

172
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,950
so they all look the same to me.

173
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,036
-I see.
-That logo!

174
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,245
You know it?

175
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:49,872
It's…

176
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:52,792
Mitsuba's logo.

177
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,001
Mitsuba?

178
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,003
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

179
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:59,632
You'll find a destroyed Mitsuba
along this road.

180
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,051
Thanks!

181
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,056
Hey, do you want to be our bodyguards?

182
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,975
We're busy right now, but one day!

183
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:15,147
Damn brats, turning down my bro's offer.

184
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:17,817
They've got skills and character.

185
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,111
I'd like to see them again
if the chance comes.

186
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,530
They're good kids.

187
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,454
HOME CENTER

188
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:36,627
Geez, that gangster. Getting my hopes up.

189
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,547
There's nothing here.

190
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,216
-Sis!
-Huh?

191
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,593
I found something we could eat!

192
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:48,389
Good job! Where was it?

193
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,017
It was in a bag under some shelves.

194
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,478
I also found an umbrella.
Should we go find the town?

195
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:59,025
Nah, there's still time until sunrise.
Let's sleep here.

196
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,027
HAYASE YOUKAN

197
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,111
Youkan.

198
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,573
Is this edible?

199
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,453
It's sweet!

200
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:13,372
You-kan! So you-can eat it!

201
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,133
So good! This is so good!

202
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,259
It's hot!

203
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,137
We still have the ingredients,
so I can make it again.

204
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,472
Let's give it a name.

205
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,143
Since it's made with youkan and bread,

206
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,436
how about "Bread-Kan Soup"?

207
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,773
Right, the way you name things
is the worst.

208
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,985
You're the one who said
"you-can eat" the youkan!

209
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:46,614
Whatever its name, it's so good!
How many more times can you make it?

210
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:47,782
Just once.

211
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,492
Only once…

212
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,749
But that was unexpected.

213
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,752
The rain? Yeah, it came out of nowhere.

214
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,128
No.

215
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:03,881
Mitsuba.

216
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,759
You're right.

217
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,470
What did he mean "I'm sure of it"?

218
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:13,599
It doesn't look like it at all.
Idiot gangsters.

219
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:14,892
MITSUBA
HOME CENTER

220
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,155
It's gone.

221
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:32,618
It should be here between these two dates.

222
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:35,538
I can't even remember it clearly.

223
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,291
I should've burned it

224
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:43,379
into the memory of my eyelids.

225
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:49,218
-Okay! Let's play my new game!
-Mimihime.

226
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,095
The only one who can play it is Taka.

227
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,013
Hey.

228
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:53,764
-Just try it.
-I'm going to the pool.

229
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,017
Picture?

230
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,812
I don't remember sending you
any messages recently.

231
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,106
I'd talk to you directly
if I needed anything.

232
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,859
-I see.
-What kind of picture was it?

233
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,486
No-- That's not important.

234
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:08,988
Actually…

235
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:14,410
You might think I'm weird for saying this.

236
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,998
Every time I look at you,

237
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,876
I get these wild urges.

238
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,919
What do you mean?

239
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,380
Can you be more specific?

240
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:28,924
Specific…

241
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,761
I want to…

242
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,765
keep you in my room.

243
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,601
I don't mind if it's for a short while.

244
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,102
And what else?

245
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:46,609
Take off your clothes and touch you.

246
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:48,194
To touch you,

247
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:52,448
and lick… lick you.

248
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,618
You want to eat me?

249
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:59,121
No! It's different from eating.

250
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,165
You'll disappear if I eat you.

251
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,709
Do you want to cut me up
and stab me with needles?

252
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,211
No way!

253
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,071
Hurry and get better, Tarao.

254
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,365
Let's play together again.

255
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:35,991
Tokio…

256
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,873
It's okay. It's not an infectious disease.

257
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:45,251
That's not what I meant.

258
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:47,837
Sorry.

259
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:50,965
Tokio.

260
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:00,975
Tokio!

261
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,742
Tokio!

262
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:20,578
What's wrong?

263
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,204
Kona.

264
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:29,086
Have you calmed down?

265
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:30,755
Yeah.

266
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,718
Everyone's acting weird these days.

267
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,223
It's so scary.

268
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,395
It's not something to be scared of.

269
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:52,068
It's natural to fall in love with someone.

270
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:59,075
One day, you'll also want to touch,
and be touched by someone.

271
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,869
There's no need to be confused by that.

272
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,333
Then--

273
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,045
If that's the case…

274
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,966
I'd like it to be Kona.

275
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,143
I want it to be you too.

276
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,876
<i>Tokio.</i>

277
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:55,715
<i>This announcement is made</i>
<i>only to your room.</i>

278
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:00,094
-<i>Tarao's condition has suddenly changed.</i>
-What?

279
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,471
<i>Tarao wants to speak with you.</i>

280
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,808
<i>Come to the treatment room</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

281
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:08,936
Tarao!

282
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:13,607
Leave us alone.

283
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,819
Are you okay? Hang in there, Tarao!

284
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:20,698
We'll be outside.
Call us if anything happens.

285
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:24,744
Tarao.

286
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:27,079
Sorry.

287
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:31,417
It's okay. Hold my hand.

288
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,673
I'm sorry about earlier.

289
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:40,968
I didn't think about your feelings.

290
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,762
Forget about that.

291
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,018
I'm not going to get better.

292
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,270
Don't say that!

293
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,149
Listen to me, Tokio.

294
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,401
You need to…

295
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:00,488
run away.

296
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,492
This place is…

297
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:07,328
dangerous.
