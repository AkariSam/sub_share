1
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,719
Of course there's an outside beyond here.

2
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:38,224
We don't know what happens
behind the teachers' doors,

3
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,811
or where our food comes from,
or what's inside the vents.

4
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:45,481
All these gaps
make me think of an "outside."

5
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,402
Why would Mimihime want to go outside?

6
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,988
Do you like Mimihime?

7
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,865
Well, yeah.

8
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,118
I see.

9
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,079
Are you okay?

10
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,626
I'm going back to my room.

11
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,461
-I'll come with you.
-It's okay.

12
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,923
Don't worry. I'll use the auto-drive.

13
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,426
TWO CONFESSIONS

14
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:30,735
Kuku, that drawing!

15
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,820
Kona gave it to me. Isn't it nice?

16
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,280
Give it here.

17
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,074
Why? He gave it to me.

18
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,535
Kona promised to give it to me.

19
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,953
No fair! You get them all!

20
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:45,416
I like Kona's drawings, too.
Why can't I get one?

21
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,044
-You're right.
-Huh?

22
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,087
Sorry, Kuku.

23
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,807
Hey! What's that for?

24
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,810
Why did you give it to Kuku?

25
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,313
You promised me.

26
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,107
I'll draw the next one for you.

27
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:11,817
Really?

28
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,488
I like the things you imagine.

29
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,241
Geez. Tokio is such a crybaby.

30
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,243
Just because Kuku got that drawing.

31
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,420
1 NEW MESSAGE

32
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,256
A message from Mimihime?

33
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,032
So sweaty.

34
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,879
Wake up, Maru. It's the Man-eater, Hiruko!

35
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,341
No good. It's locked.

36
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,759
I'll go out through the bathroom.

37
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,432
Wake up.

38
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,728
She fed us some sort of drug
to put us to sleep.

39
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,487
You two! It's dangerous. Get back inside!

40
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:41,449
I told you we can kill it.

41
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:45,828
The Kiru-Beam?

42
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,455
Fully charged.

43
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,335
-There!
-Huh?

44
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,062
Whoa!

45
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,689
I'm okay. Just tripped.

46
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,119
What was that?

47
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,372
Maru, try throwing something.

48
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,040
Okay!

49
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,209
An ultrasonic blast?

50
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,544
No, I see something flickering.

51
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,464
That's not the sound of its voice.

52
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,510
That's the sound of its whip things!

53
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,942
There are three whips on each arm.

54
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,028
I can't get close unless we destroy them.

55
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,489
Three? Gotta get the wings, too.

56
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,616
Are there enough bullets?

57
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,161
No, three and three makes six.

58
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,329
I know that.

59
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,248
Wait…

60
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,500
Where is it?

61
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,713
This way!

62
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,388
Yes!

63
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,640
I hit an arm and a wing!

64
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,891
What a sniper.

65
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,310
The gun's range
is a bit longer than the whips.

66
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:37,898
If I can get a bit closer,
I can hit the other arm.

67
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,692
Then you can go after it, Maru.

68
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,153
-Okay.
-Here goes.

69
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,364
You'll lose an arm if you get too close.
Be careful.

70
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,826
I was trying not to think about that…

71
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:16,896
Here!

72
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,067
The manager?

73
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,943
Run! Get away!

74
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,573
Stop! That's my son.

75
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,993
So your son was eaten by that thing.

76
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:36,207
No. Yuto went inside it,
and it became Yuto!

77
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,962
You drugged us to protect the Man-eater.

78
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,591
I was almost eaten by one, so I know…

79
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,845
It cuts up its prey and absorbs them.

80
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,099
But I'm sorry, I don't think those
who are eaten take over its body.

81
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,975
But that is Yuto!

82
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,852
He protects me.

83
00:07:56,936 --> 00:08:01,399
He even rescued me when I was attacked.

84
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,152
Fine. I get it.

85
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,446
Sis.

86
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,824
I'm out of shots.

87
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,827
If it's not a threat,
there's no reason to kill it.

88
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,746
Yuto!

89
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,832
They understand.

90
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,251
I'm safe.

91
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,839
They can communicate?

92
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,675
See?

93
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,731
Damn it!

94
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,274
Did you see?

95
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,319
The whip only swings in one direction.

96
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:50,656
So there's a pause between attacks.

97
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,201
How can you think like that?
Someone just died!

98
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,707
If I don't, we won't survive.

99
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,753
Sorry.

100
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,882
I'll kill it.

101
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,160
I got in!

102
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:01,352
Why didn't Hiruko attack
the manager until yesterday?

103
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:06,190
Maybe it was her son's consciousness,

104
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,901
or it instinctively kept her alive.

105
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:12,154
Since its prey gathers around this place…

106
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:17,535
Maybe she fed the guests to her son…

107
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,121
Let's stop.

108
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,997
The truth can stay hidden.

109
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,251
{\an8}We already have enough on our hands.

110
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,087
{\an8}Looking for "Heaven."

111
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,507
Oh, the batteries. Want to take them?

112
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,593
Didn't you give them to the manager?

113
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,142
Hey, stop that!

114
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:47,064
Sis, have you ever ridden a moving train?

115
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,984
I was three during the Great Disaster.

116
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,403
I wouldn't remember even if I had.

117
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,904
Wait.

118
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,949
If you're 20, then you were five--

119
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,034
Hey!

120
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:00,161
Is that water safe?

121
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,580
It's okay, I'm just rinsing my mouth.

122
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,373
Plus, it doesn't taste weird.

123
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,876
It's such a nice day.

124
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,295
Perfect for sailing.

125
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,132
KIRUKO-MARU

126
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,177
Okay.

127
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,845
Let's go down.

128
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,065
It's shakier than I thought!

129
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,317
Get on gently!

130
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,902
Step like a feather.

131
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,487
That's impossible!

132
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,739
All right!

133
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,991
It's floating somehow.

134
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,663
If those old guys were telling the truth,
Tomato Heaven is right in front of us.

135
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:50,670
Kind of late to ask, but there aren't
any sharks or crocodiles, right?

136
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:55,257
-Don't know.
-Hey!

137
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,927
The only thing I can kill is Hiruko!

138
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,138
You gotta do something if a croc shows up.

139
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,266
I-- I'll think of something
before you get eaten up.

140
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,977
You can't let it bite me.
You're the bodyguard!

141
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:12,024
If I was a crocodile, I'd eat you first.

142
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,778
Row! Go all out!

143
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,322
It's not that far.

144
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:21,742
Just keep praying
that a carnivore doesn't show up!

145
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:25,955
Sorry.

146
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,207
It's okay. I'll go get it.

147
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,507
<i>The teachers-only door.</i>

148
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,428
<i>Is the outside behind it?</i>

149
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,182
The ball went over there…

150
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,351
<i>Go ahead and take it.</i>

151
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,613
There it is.

152
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,242
Okay, stick there.

153
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,537
Are you really going to do it?
It's dangerous!

154
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,542
I'm going to test how strong this is.

155
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,919
They'll get mad if you break it.

156
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,088
I said it'll be fine.

157
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,051
Now, I'll begin the great experiment!

158
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,015
Wow!

159
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,475
Amazing.

160
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,518
It's going so high.

161
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,855
At this rate, it'll go all the way up.

162
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,733
Whoa! Hold--

163
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,453
Ouch.

164
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,711
Why is Shiro the one bleeding?

165
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,882
What's wrong?

166
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:04,136
I get the feeling
something else is going to fall.

167
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,226
If this is "Heaven,"
then my job ends here.

168
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,728
KUSAKABE FARM TRESPASSERS
WILL BE MERCILESSLY KILLED

169
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:19,443
But you don't know where "Heaven" is,
or what you'll do when you get there.

170
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,736
Yup.

171
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,366
So my job doesn't end
until you're satisfied with the results.

172
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:30,663
I'll do everything I can,
so don't keep any secrets from me.

173
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,624
I'm not hiding anything, but…

174
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:35,876
This.

175
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,132
There's a needle and a drug
inside this cylinder.

176
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,679
There's a guy with the same face as me
out there somewhere.

177
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:51,183
I was told to inject him with this drug
when I find him.

178
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,771
I believe that the person I'm looking for,
is in this place called "Heaven."

179
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,898
And after the shot?

180
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,193
Don't know. He'll get better?

181
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:05,364
Anyway, I was told it would help everyone.

182
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,659
I don't know anything else.

183
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,662
Did she tell you anything?

184
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:15,791
You were the last one to see Mikura.

185
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:19,545
Pull it down.

186
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,927
Protect Maru with this.

187
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,264
I will. Where should I take him?

188
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:33,392
Hea…

189
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:38,814
She only told me to take you to "Heaven."

190
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:41,108
What're you guys doing?

191
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,778
Hello.

192
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,364
You don't look like bandits.

193
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:47,740
Are you locals?

194
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:51,744
No, we walked all the way from Tokyo.

195
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,621
And you found us?

196
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,248
Someone told us about this place.

197
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,334
It's like "Heaven."

198
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,211
So you came here on purpose.

199
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:02,296
You want to join us?

200
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,465
You see, this kid is--

201
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,593
Let's take them to the Leader.

202
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,346
This way. Come on in.

203
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,057
-Taisuke!
-Yeah!

204
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,853
If you're from Tokyo,
then you climbed down the big fault?

205
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,439
Oh, that huge cliff?

206
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:24,860
It was so tiring.
We made a raft and crossed over.

207
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,863
That's dangerous!

208
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,782
Saltwater crocs swim in those waters.

209
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:31,951
What?

210
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,704
There were crocs. Crocs!

211
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:37,915
You weren't eaten so don't think about it.

212
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,712
I'm Kusakabe, the leader of this village.

213
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,922
This is my wife, Momoko.

214
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:49,802
As you see, we're just a rag-tag bunch.

215
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:56,058
<i>We tried to cling to the past,</i>
<i>and dreamt of reviving our society,</i>

216
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,811
<i>but many people grew tired</i>
<i>of such futile hopes.</i>

217
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,568
<i>So we chose a simple life,</i>
<i>living off the fruits of the earth.</i>

218
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:09,572
<i>It was just my father and a few farmers,</i>

219
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,824
<i>but we soon became this large family.</i>

220
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,869
Wow. That's awesome.

221
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:19,457
I heard this is "Tomato Heaven,"
is that right?

222
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,419
It used to be full of tomatoes.

223
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,964
Now we can grow all kinds of local crops.

224
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,972
Tomato Heaven is such a nice place.

225
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:41,187
A farm this size is amazing,
but something feels off.

226
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,273
They are nice enough to feed us, though.

227
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,818
Well, if you think so, Sis.

228
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,779
Make your own opinions.

229
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:57,286
Since no one's reacting to your face,
I guess that look-alike guy isn't here.

230
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:00,915
Right, that's one way to find out.

231
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:04,752
As if, did you not realize that
this entire time?

232
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,213
That face!

233
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,549
You're Kiriko Takehaya!

234
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,510
The electro-kart racer!

235
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,054
No, you got it wrong.

236
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:20,184
I was a huge fan.
Look, I still have your photo.

237
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:24,772
How long since you disappeared?

238
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,733
Five years? I was so worried.

239
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,780
There were rumors that you lost it
after killing your brother in a race.

240
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:33,864
Hey!

241
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,450
She doesn't look--

242
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:44,333
They might look alike, but that's not her.

243
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,503
-But--
-I said you got the wrong person!

244
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,755
So sorry.

245
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,632
Wait!

246
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,093
I just…

247
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:59,598
This! Sis, doesn't this look familiar?

248
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,352
Maybe, maybe not…

249
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:04,770
I got it! It's here!

250
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,774
Don't go around groping someone's leg.

251
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,652
No, this.

252
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,909
Where did you get this box?

253
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,745
Not sure.

254
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,791
We're always taking vegetables
and stuff to Tokyo on the ship.

255
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,628
Boxes like this can come from anywhere.

256
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:32,298
You can get to Tokyo by ship?

257
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,507
Wow.

258
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:37,762
If we look into this logo,
won't we find a connection to you, Maru?

259
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,974
At least, we'll find out what it is.

260
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,021
By the way, do you know
of a place called "Heaven"?

261
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,939
-Right here.
-Other than here!

262
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:57,823
Asakusa during Kiriko Takehaya's era.

263
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,286
Thanks a lot.

264
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,121
That helps.

265
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,128
If we don't get any more information,
let's get on the ship back to Tokyo.

266
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:12,213
Okay.

267
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,632
Japan is much bigger than I thought.

268
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,761
We'll never find "Heaven" this way.

269
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,056
It's a waste to go back,

270
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:26,477
but if we investigate your background,
I think we'll get to Heaven faster.

271
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:33,025
Found some potatoes! Want one?

272
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,194
They won't know if one is missing.

273
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:39,490
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>You don't look good. Seasick?</i>

274
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,827
Forget about Heaven.

275
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,079
We won't find it.

276
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:49,041
I want to live on the farm with you.

277
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,002
Not me.

278
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:55,715
Farming all day and getting high at night…

279
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:58,801
What nature? It's just a bunch of idiots.

280
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,511
That's not what I mean.

281
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,723
I could help you with your job.

282
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:07,810
I-- I like you, Sis!

283
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,940
DO NOT ENTER

284
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:17,945
Hey! Confessing in such a place
doesn't do either of us any good.

285
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:19,739
I'm serious!

286
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,282
Give me a serious answer.

287
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,372
Wait, stop! Get off!

288
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:29,832
Forcing is--

289
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,711
I'm so, so, sorry.

290
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,839
It's okay. Thanks, though.

291
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:42,428
Hey, I'm going to tell you something.
So listen.

292
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:49,894
It might be crazy, but I'm being serious,
so I want you to understand.

293
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,482
My body is a woman's,

294
00:21:55,524 --> 00:22:00,237
but in here, my mind is a man's.

295
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,118
So… I'm a man.

296
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,872
What?
