1
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,430
Ouch, that hurts!

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,890
Get off already!

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,852
Run!

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,438
Honestly…

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,440
Kona is amazing!

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,400
You're so good at drawing.

7
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,862
I bet Tokio wouldn't like that.

8
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,866
I wonder how Tokio is doing.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,950
Yeah…

10
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,495
I heard Kona is communicating with Tokio.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,751
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

12
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,379
It's okay, keep going.

13
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,468
It hurts so much!

14
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,011
I'm dying! I'm dying!

15
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:56,140
-You can do it.
-It hurts! I'm dying! I'm going to die!

16
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,725
<i>Kona!</i>

17
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,522
Tokio.

18
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>The baby will be born.</i>

19
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,110
{\an8}TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

20
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,153
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

21
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,628
Hey.

22
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,424
-Morning.
-Don't climb on the car. You'll dent it.

23
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,469
You've climbed up here plenty.

24
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,763
It's my car, so I can do what I want.

25
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,182
It's our car, by the way.

26
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,267
Wrong, it's mine.

27
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,644
KIRUKO-NINE

28
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,480
Kiruko-nine?

29
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,192
I was wondering
what you were doing all morning.

30
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,445
Pay attention,
the character for Maru is like this.

31
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,989
At least write it correctly.

32
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,367
Oh, well.

33
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,412
While we're at it,
let's add Juichi's name.

34
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:24,497
Good idea.

35
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,958
KIRUKO MARU JUICHI

36
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,627
I know we've already written it,

37
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,589
but I just realized Juichi's name
makes it look like our 11th car.

38
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:34,965
So what if it does?

39
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,135
Trust is everything in my job.

40
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,222
I don't want people to think
it's just some meaningless front.

41
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,892
Well, at least
the first Kirukomaru really existed.

42
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,477
You mean, the raft?

43
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:51,065
Wait, if you read Juichi's name
as Roman numerals, it's Kirukomaru II!

44
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,858
So it makes perfect sense!

45
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,569
But then we're leaving Juichi out.

46
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,700
Hey, stop nit-picking
and give me directions.

47
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,702
You're the nitpicker.

48
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,537
TAKAHARA ACADEMY
(IBARAKI FACILITY)

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,871
Right…

50
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,166
I don't get how you know the way
with this information.

51
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,672
If you wanna know about
the old civilization, ask someone older.

52
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,977
So, tell me the status of the combatants.

53
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,731
It appears that after transportation,
all eight awoke from suspended animation.

54
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:38,029
The prototype of their Super-Beam
is also ready.

55
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,699
My next concern is the children's illness.

56
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,412
Will the 5th year students fall ill too?

57
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,497
Well, they could.

58
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,543
I'm not in a position to say that
there's no possibility of that.

59
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,129
It's never straightforward with you,
is it?

60
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,881
It's a possibility.

61
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:01,635
At present, we don't know the cause.
We don't have a cure either.

62
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,471
Just as I feared.

63
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,807
We will just have to wager on it.

64
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:09,393
Wager? Wager on what?

65
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,689
Tokio's child.

66
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:16,275
The child of two children.

67
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:20,321
Not a child birthed by Mina,
but a child of two children.

68
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,157
This is far from what was planned.

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,659
This is something else altogether!

70
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,663
We will have to wager everything
on Tokio's child.

71
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,957
You'll do it, won't you?

72
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,712
It's up to me to ensure with my own eyes

73
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:40,716
that Heaven blooms
in this utterly broken world.

74
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,054
But, unless the shackles
of human mortality are broken,

75
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,931
I cannot do so.

76
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,434
Takahara Academy will break them.

77
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,395
B-But…

78
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,773
But for brain transplants,
the container must be 15 years old.

79
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,151
They should be 13 at the very least.
Otherwise it is impossible.

80
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:02,780
And I won't live another 13 years?

81
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,990
I see how it is.

82
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:08,911
I'm just some dried up 80-year-old lady?

83
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,746
That level of agitation will only--

84
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,915
Only what?

85
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,001
Shorten my life-span?

86
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,463
Director!

87
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,010
I lost my composure.

88
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,305
I understand that
my remaining years are limited.

89
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,350
You must have realized it

90
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,145
if your panic in the meeting earlier
is anything to go by.

91
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,773
First, I'll become Miss Aoshima.

92
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:43,446
Then I will wait patiently
for the container to mature.

93
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,533
I can withstand a second transplant
if I wait that long, right?

94
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:52,663
So that's why you increased
Aoshima's access rights?

95
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,249
Has Aoshima given her consent?

96
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,211
When you agree
to become the assistant director,

97
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,174
you also agree to eventually
become the director, right?

98
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,302
You expect this kind of absurdity
to be permitted?

99
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,221
Permitted? By who?

100
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,723
Permitted by law?

101
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,933
Or by international public opinion?

102
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,852
Those things are long gone.

103
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,438
Or, could you mean…

104
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,440
God?

105
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,278
You must know that, in the end,

106
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:28,616
those are just different names
to call the pressure to conform.

107
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:34,538
Aren't you at Takahara Academy
to avoid being tied down by such things?

108
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,124
That is why we created Heaven.

109
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:41,087
There's already no turning back for us.

110
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,131
We either continue, or fail entirely.

111
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:48,969
Make sure Tokio's child

112
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,347
<i>is delivered as safely as possible.</i>

113
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,604
So cute.

114
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,691
{\an8}KIRUKOMARU II

115
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,151
Hey, are you okay?

116
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,613
So he can fight well
and put up with the cold,

117
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,657
but is useless with car sickness.

118
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,451
I made some food,
do you think you can eat some?

119
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,328
Food?

120
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,375
What's this? Bread! Amazing.

121
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,293
I found it in Kirukomaru II.

122
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,378
LONG-LASTING BREAD

123
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:27,341
It expired seven years ago,
so I toasted it over a fire, just in case.

124
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,512
It's tasty, this old civilization food.

125
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,891
I had a quick look around
while you were sleeping,

126
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:39,186
but this whole area has already
been scavenged clean of stuff.

127
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,982
There isn't a single window in this house,
let alone resources.

128
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:44,817
You're right.

129
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:49,155
And also,
there are pros and cons to having a car.

130
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,533
It's taking forever
to get to our destination.

131
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,453
All because of some bumps
we could easily get over on foot.

132
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,497
ON THE BEACH: MANKIND'S
FINAL DAYS - NEVIL SHUTE

133
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,208
Maru, turn off the light already.

134
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,337
Sorry, was it shining in your eyes?

135
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,671
No, not that.

136
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:09,300
This house is so bare,
anyone would see a light straightaway.

137
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,677
We should be extra careful.

138
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,429
Okay then.

139
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:21,896
I shouldn't have napped earlier.
Now I'm so awake…

140
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,316
Wait, Sis!

141
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,194
She's already asleep.

142
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,572
Must be nice to fall asleep so fast.

143
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,784
Sis. I can see some smoke in the distance.

144
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,370
Sure you're not dreaming?

145
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,955
There's no way
you could see smoke far away at night.

146
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,374
I'm not dreaming.

147
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,042
I didn't even go to sleep yet.

148
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,380
-Oh, wow. You're right.
-See?

149
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,801
If we can see that from this distance,
there must be some light source below it.

150
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,303
So, let's get the map.

151
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,222
And the compass.

152
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,643
It's definitely coming from the direction
of the Ibaraki facility.

153
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,396
Sh-Shall we go over there?

154
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,774
No, it's dangerous to move at night.

155
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:10,236
Let's leave the car here
and walk there tomorrow.

156
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,821
Okay.

157
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,073
So, are you…

158
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,827
Ohma? Was that it?

159
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,166
Don't you want to play with the others?

160
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,919
I…

161
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,630
I'll just annoy them.

162
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:46,832
Ouch.

163
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,626
So painful!

164
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,962
I can't bear it. Stop it.

165
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,800
Wait! Stop!

166
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,427
Wait, stop it, stop it! Stop!

167
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,796
Sounded like you had a nightmare.

168
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,383
Why are you in here?

169
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,928
Are you sick?

170
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,555
There's nothing wrong with my body,

171
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:46,058
but I seem to have
synchronized up with Tokio.

172
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,936
So is Tokio sick, then?

173
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,647
No, no. Tokio is fine.

174
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,860
It's just me who can't seem to get up.

175
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:01,240
Well, I guess it's good
you're both okay then.

176
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,617
Why are you here?

177
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,869
I…

178
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,872
Do you know Ohma?

179
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,791
Yeah, the one with the black glasses?

180
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,876
Yes, that one.

181
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,629
When I looked directly into Ohma's eyes,
it made me hallucinate.

182
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,760
I don't know how to say it.
It was like my worst fears became real.

183
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,928
I mean, it was only a hallucination,

184
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,892
but sharp objects
like blades and other things

185
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,394
seem to really scare me, for some reason.

186
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:35,399
It's not like I have a scary memory
of anything involving things like that.

187
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,569
I understand. It's a phobia.

188
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:43,199
I'm really scared
of being trapped in small spaces.

189
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,369
If I had a hallucination like that,
I think I would faint.

190
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,537
I…

191
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:53,292
Quite often I see things
that others don't.

192
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:55,795
Like what?

193
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,630
Like…

194
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,800
I see figures floating in the sky,

195
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,678
or I see something
that's about to happen, before it does.

196
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,764
But it's a little vague.

197
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,849
And I'm not sure when
what I see will happen.

198
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:13,604
It might feel like it'll happen tomorrow,
but then it never does.

199
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:18,067
Or like it'll happen way in the future,
but then it happens ten seconds later.

200
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,153
<i>I-It's happening now.</i>

201
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:23,739
<i>I see.</i>

202
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,827
<i>So it's like a premonition,</i>
<i>or an intuition of the future.</i>

203
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,788
<i>Everyone probably gets those feelings</i>
<i>to a certain degree,</i>

204
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,082
<i>but it seems like yours are much stronger.</i>

205
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,585
<i>Go away, go away.</i>

206
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,088
<i>Go away, go away.</i>

207
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,715
<i>Go away, go away!</i>

208
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,354
I'm gonna go back to my room.

209
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,815
Okay, rest up.

210
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:04,447
Ohma?

211
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,909
-Why are you out here at this time?
-Here.

212
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,747
You were waiting this whole time
just to return my handkerchief?

213
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,831
Yes.

214
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,460
Mimihime, I'm…

215
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,504
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,977
Don't do that!

217
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,282
<i>Go away, go away.</i>

218
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,951
<i>Go away, go away.</i>

219
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,119
<i>Go away.</i>

220
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,621
Go away!

221
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,296
See? I'm fine.

222
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:07,635
The thing that annoys everyone else
has no effect on me.

223
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:12,098
So you don't need to cry
or apologize anymore.

224
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,238
What a mess.

225
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:29,824
There's barely any space left to walk.

226
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,327
My head's a total mess too.

227
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:37,206
<i>That's the correct one. Please continue.</i>

228
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,625
<i>Plug C23 into Y7, and…</i>

229
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:42,920
-What exactly are we building?
-<i>…F18 into Z11.</i>

230
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,923
If the head of the Tech Department
doesn't know, no one does.

231
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,927
No, I don't just mean these machines.

232
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:54,557
<i>I know the goal is to create a pure Heaven</i>
<i>in a broken world.</i>

233
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,892
<i>That much is clear.</i>

234
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,312
But beyond that,

235
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,524
after the main goal of creating Heaven,

236
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,111
the information we're being given
is too fragmented.

237
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:11,365
After that, aren't we going to expand
Heaven into the outside?

238
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,869
That plan seems pretty clear to me.

239
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:19,248
Plus, Director said "soon,"
so it must be true.

240
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:21,876
I guess so.

241
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,005
Plus, we've already
crossed so many taboos.

242
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,175
<i>Please continue with the task.</i>

243
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,636
<i>B44 into A16.</i>

244
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,765
<i>H5 into Q31.</i>

245
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,769
God is telling us to go!

246
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,146
Let's execute the plan.

247
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:45,232
Now's our chance,
while the director isn't here.

248
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,778
I've made the preliminary arrangements.

249
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,155
Then when can we start? Specifically?

250
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:55,618
If the gate to the outside
were to accidentally open, then anytime.

251
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:58,371
I wouldn't call that specific.

252
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,125
-Oops. It's time for the milk.
-What?

253
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,670
-Please excuse me.
-Wait, Dr. Sawatari!

254
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,464
Hey, wait!

255
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:13,552
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

256
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:18,099
<i>Today is Saturday, July 20th. Ten'ei 18.</i>

257
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,770
<i>For first period,</i>
<i>please gather at the pool.</i>

258
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,567
<i>There will be no swimming,</i>
<i>so you may attend in your uniforms.</i>

259
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,612
-Want to compete today?
-Yeah, sounds good.

260
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:35,574
Why are you in your swimsuit?

261
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:40,788
I guess some people didn't listen properly
and came in their swimsuits.

262
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,915
Right, Anzu?

263
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,921
Don't fall in.

264
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,507
Mimihime.

265
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:57,555
It's Tokio!

266
00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,306
Tokio.

267
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,267
You look fine!

268
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,435
Your hair got longer.

269
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,354
They said I can come back to school soon.

270
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:06,439
Really?

271
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,734
-We can play with Tokio again!
-That's great!

272
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:12,653
<i>Okay, everyone,</i>

273
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,948
<i>please stop talking</i>
<i>and give me your full attention.</i>

274
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,326
What? What lesson is that?

275
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,454
All the students are gathered together.

276
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,372
Is it a school assembly?

277
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,126
<i>We will be having a test shortly.</i>

278
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:32,006
<i>It will be a long test,</i>
<i>but you will have plenty of time.</i>

279
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,716
-A test?
-What kind of test?

280
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:36,302
<i>When you are lost</i>
<i>and cannot find the answer,</i>

281
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:40,222
<i>please proceed in the direction</i>
<i>that you believe to be the correct one.</i>

282
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,352
<i>To reach the outside of the outside</i>

283
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:47,271
<i>is your role, as Hiruko.</i>

284
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,068
<i>The first problem will appear momentarily.</i>

285
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:56,364
<i>I wish you all the best of luck.</i>

286
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,702
That was some weird lesson.

287
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,081
Anzu, let's go for a swim!

288
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,874
I think I'll pass.

289
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,877
Hey, Taka.

290
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:12,672
What is it?

291
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,883
What do you think the test is?

292
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:21,263
It's sudden, but they did give us notice.
At least it's not totally out of the blue.

293
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:26,477
I'm not sure why, but I'm worried.

294
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,855
Anzu, you're smart. You'll be fine!

295
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:31,941
It should be me who's worried.

296
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,986
That's not really what I meant.

297
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:40,199
Did you hear? They mentioned Hiruko.

298
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:42,618
Did they?

299
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:45,329
I felt like
I was being called by my real name.

300
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:48,082
One that I had completely forgotten.

301
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,084
Me too.

302
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,129
I had the same feeling.

303
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,810
{\an8}TOKIO JR. - JR. C

304
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:14,984
Sleep tight.

305
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,543
I thought you were studying,
but it's a game isn't it?

306
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:37,089
What's the point of studying
if we don't know what the test is about?

307
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:38,799
Yeah, good point.

308
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:09,872
THE TEST BEGINS
