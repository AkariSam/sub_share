You found a rare one.

11
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,487
If it still plays, it's worth 400,000.

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,656
No way!

13
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,835
Oh, man! I really wanted to hear it!

00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,551

What have we here?

18
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,231
Crocodile Quest, right?

19
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,193
Why are you only using two people,
when you could use four?

20
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,112
Not from around here, are ya?

21
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:14,200
If you're gonna play here,
you better speak when spoken to.

22
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,284
Hi.

23
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,455
Ever had a girl you like
turn out to be a guy? Can you imagine?

24
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,375
Can't say I've come across that--

25
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,003
What's that got to do with anything?

26
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:31,592
Don't just say "Hi." Insolent brat!

27
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,100
Hey.

28
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,687
Wasn't one whack enough?

29
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,148
What was the kick for? Say sorry!

30
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,192
Guess you're right.

31
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,654
Sorry.

32
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,703
Take it outside, will you?
You're tearing the place up.

33
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,205
Ouch.

34
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,290
Oops, look at you now.

35
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,335
Why are you looking away
in the middle of fight?

36
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,671
Is he stupid or what? Moron.

37
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,564
Wait, stop.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,441
You brat!

39
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,114
What the hell is this guy?

40
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,211
-Sis?
-Are you okay, Maru?

41
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:53,549
Whoa, why did you bulldoze in
with no clue what's going on?

42
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,593
What if it was my fault?

43
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,095
We've been hanging out for ages.

44
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:01,349
I think I'd know if you were the type
who looks for fights.

45
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,103
And anyway,
who knows if he was about to call backup.

46
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,064
If you attack, you've got to get them all.

47
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,232
-Guess so.
-It's not just "guess so."

48
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,193
Wait, your tooth!

49
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,195
Your tooth broke off.

50
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,197
Hey, let me see.

51
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,407
It'll grow back.

52
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,618
It won't grow back. It's an adult tooth!

53
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:22,870
Let's get out of here.

54
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,539
Let's get further away
then sleep somewhere.

TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

57
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,473
<i>I was born the same year</i>
<i>as the Great Disaster, apparently.</i>

58
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:11,228
<i>The first memories I have</i>
<i>are from three or four years old.</i>

59
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:16,484
<i>I lived in a spacious room</i>
<i>with other kids about my age.</i>

60
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,236
<i>I was cold and hungry,</i>

61
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:23,866
<i>but there were adults to take care of me,</i>
<i>so it wasn't so bad.</i>

62
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,996
<i>I think I was about seven</i>
<i>when the place closed down, I guess.</i>

63
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,541
<i>The adults took us all</i>
<i>to different locations.</i>

64
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,503
<i>There were others like me,</i>

65
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,797
<i>without any relatives, I suppose.</i>

66
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,383
<i>We were all put in a separate group</i>

67
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,803
<i>and somehow</i>
<i>survived on scraps for three years.</i>

68
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:48,849
<i>The adult who led our group,</i>
<i>was killed over some sort of turf war.</i>

69
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,019
<i>We went with the killer,</i>

70
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:55,147
<i>and became part of their gang.</i>

71
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,733
<i>I was still working with them</i>
<i>until recently.</i>

72
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:04,865
<i>Then Mikura turned up and took me in.</i>

73
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,746
<i>She was the one who taught me</i>
<i>how to kill Hiruko.</i>

74
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,831
DAY OF FATE

75
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,668
Did you think of Mikura as a woman?

76
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,504
Not really.

77
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:22,091
She was just the next person
I had to listen to.

78
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,137
You don't fall in love easily, then?

79
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,680
What are you talking about?

80
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,476
Anyway, whenever she looked at me,
she always had this coldness in her eyes.

81
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,854
She didn't really treat me like a human.

82
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,152
Can't you at least remember
where the town is, or the name of it?

83
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,280
Until I started traveling with Mikura,

84
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,824
I didn't know how big Japan was.

85
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:52,038
I didn't even have any idea
where I was in Japan.

86
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:56,292
My life has basically consisted
of nothing but following adults around.

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,376
Don't be dramatic.

88
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,005
Especially if you're not offering
any new information.

89
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,758
I've told you the story a thousand times.
What did you expect?

90
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,010
Not the point.
If you tell it over and over,

91
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,096
you might remember something,
or notice something.

92
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,766
I read that somewhere.

93
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,894
Oh, yeah. Speaking of books,
have you seen the next room?

94
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,688
There are so many books! Let's sell them.

95
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,692
I packed as many novels and comics
as I could while you were sleeping.

96
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:26,530
I'm going to burn any books
that seem useful after I've read them.

97
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,660
Knowledge has more value
if you keep it to yourself.

98
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:32,912
Oh, got it.

99
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,205
MORNING STAR GRAPH NO. 336

100
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,540
Oh, that's a newspaper from the town.

101
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,793
Why don't you read it while waiting?

102
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,545
Aren't we going shopping together?

103
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,798
Your face will get us busted.

104
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,009
We'll be in a total mess
if the guys from yesterday recognize you.

105
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,182
It's fine!

106
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,892
It's a bit swollen, but it's not busted.

107
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,020
Oh, boy.

108
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,106
Try to understand, okay?

109
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,942
I'm not saying your face is busted.

110
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,194
I'm saying your face will get us busted.

111
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,742
So, if Mikura taught you everything,

112
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,828
does that mean she has the Maru-Touch too?

113
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,539
No, she said only I could do it.

114
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,792
And that's why I need to go to Heaven.

115
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:25,214
By the way, the poster at your office
said you could kill Man-eaters.

116
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,758
That was just advertising.

117
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,515
CHARGING SHOP

118
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:40,980
Where'd he disappear to?
The stupid kid with the disheveled hair.

119
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,275
That brat doesn't bother me.

120
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,861
We should be focusing
on the Ministry of Reconstruction.

121
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,738
You think they're nearby?

122
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,741
No idea.
That rumor is always flying about.

123
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,160
<i>Ministry of Reconstruction.</i>

124
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,370
<i>That rumor is still being passed around?</i>

125
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,667
There's a group abducting people
with the right skills and expertise

126
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,796
to get civilization back to how it was.

127
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,965
Are they going to come to Asakusa?

128
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,677
It's just a rumor, but they might.

129
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,348
Sis said that's just a fantasy
that old people believe.

130
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,224
That's an alternative explanation.

131
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,642
Wait a sec.

132
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:22,897
Does this have something to do
with all those disappearances?

133
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,276
Well, you guys have pretty special skills
fixing all those electro-karts.

134
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,322
Better to act stupid
if someone you don't know comes along.

135
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,533
How would you act stupid? Ran?

136
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,453
Oh, you're good at it.

137
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,288
I didn't do anything yet!

138
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:49,840
We've searched all over the place
and he's not here. Must have left.

139
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,927
But what if he's still here?

140
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,304
We'll just grab him.

141
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:58,474
Iwata said he wants another round.
One on one.

142
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:02,186
You wouldn't say that
if you were there yesterday.

143
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,856
There were eight of us
and he completely destroyed us.

144
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,234
He's like an explosive.

145
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,860
No way I want a second round.

146
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,698
My little Maru is strong, huh?

147
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,328
My Maru?

148
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,874
Why am I proud of him?

149
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,087
<i>I'm just his bodyguard.</i>

150
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:32,174
<i>Once he finds what he's looking for,</i>
<i>I'll be alone again.</i>

151
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:41,726
What…

152
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:44,687
Maru?

153
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,860
Hey, Maru.

154
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,832
Ma-- Maru!

155
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,586
Maru!

156
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:13,799
Maru.

157
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,762
Where is he?

158
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,222
Be quiet!

159
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:22,099
Why are you yelling like that?

160
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,185
I was hiding like I'm meant to be.

161
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,440
What were you doing in the next room?

162
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:33,319
What? I was just…

163
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:37,031
I was looking to see
if there are any useful books in there.

164
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,617
Hey, wait! There's nothing to see.

165
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,410
YOUNG LADY'S SPECIAL LESSON

166
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,913
I get it.

167
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,998
You were just using those porno magazines.

168
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,292
Using? I was just look--

169
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,252
Wait, I wasn't looking either!

170
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,590
Sis! What happened?

171
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:55,675
You seem weird.

172
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,221
I never thought I would panic like that.

173
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,142
I got back and you weren't here.
Please don't do that again.

174
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,144
I told you before.

175
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,231
I might not always
be exactly where you left me.

176
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,782
Sorry, I was wrong.

177
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,284
I think?

178
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:27,832
When I was telling you
about my upbringing,

179
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:33,170
I was wondering
whether yours had been even worse.

180
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:37,591
Hey.

181
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,679
I-- I can feel something hard.

182
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,599
You can't blame me!
I was already halfway--

183
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:49,437
Wait, I wasn't halfway anywhere,
but even so!

184
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,776
I was reading something in the newspaper.

185
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,031
Before the Great Disaster,
humans made robots to make life easier.

186
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,869
But they started to get nervous
that the robots were monitoring them.

187
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:07,371
But the truth is,

188
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,751
humans had too much spare time
and ended up monitoring each other.

189
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,878
They started to push their own rules
onto each other,

190
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,964
and slaughtered one another
until everything perished.

191
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,884
That's the War Collapse Theory.

192
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,552
Sounds made-up to me.

193
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,554
It's too much like an old fable.

194
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,724
The story just means that life before
wasn't just like Heaven.

195
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,102
Besides, if Heaven existed
before the Great Disaster,

196
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:33,981
I'd have to go into the past,
which is impossible.

197
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:38,986
But everyone who knows about life before,
wants to go back.

198
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:45,451
What if, somewhere out there,
civilization has already been restored?

199
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,217
Is that…

200
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,345
a footprint?

201
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,475
Why would there be a footprint here?

202
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,086
What are you doing?

203
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,548
If Tarao hears some fun sounds,
he might wake up.

204
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,594
And over there?

205
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:48,597
When Tarao was well,
apparently he could pick up that rock.

206
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,975
He didn't just pick it up.

207
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,227
He could throw it all the way over there.

208
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,313
Tarao was really strong.

209
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,526
I can do it too!

210
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:15,374
Ten'ei 17, October 16th, 11:34 p.m.

211
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,377
I'm so sorry.

212
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,886
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

213
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,974
<i>Once dressed please come to the square</i>
<i>before going to breakfast.</i>

214
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:36,270
<i>Tarao passed away last night.</i>

215
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,278
Did Asura have the same disease?

216
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,034
Asura.

217
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,872
Yeah.

218
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,917
Maybe, yes.

219
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:48,009
Mina, may we cremate Tarao's body?

220
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:52,304
<i>Yes, we've already taken</i>
<i>the samples we need.</i>

221
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,433
It's desperately sad.

222
00:16:56,267 --> 00:17:00,438
This is the second death
among the children.

223
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,108
No one could have predicted
Asura's suicide.

224
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,192
That's not true.

225
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,530
Asura was born into a body
that could not bear its own mind.

226
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,157
ASURA - TEN'EI 12, MAY 7TH

227
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,868
We are the ones responsible
for Asura's death.

228
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:18,039
Too many cruel ideas
were forced upon Asura.

229
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,959
Asura's birth itself was a sin.

230
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,213
Put Tarao's grave next to Asura's.

231
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,972
Was Tarao's illness a strange one? Or…

232
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,935
If an illness developed within a body
built with immunity to everything,

233
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,938
then it's possible that all the children
could fall ill.

234
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:45,066
Then we have a big problem!

235
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,735
The Day of Fate is the only thing
that can't be changed.

236
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:52,073
Until then,
figure out what it is and how to cure it!

237
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,749
Me too?

238
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,835
Am I sick too?

239
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:07,838
What do you think?

240
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:12,093
I sold all the books in my backpack
and bought this map.

241
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:14,679
That's the value of information.

242
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,431
Yeah, right.

243
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,685
"Water safety level, 50%."

244
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,063
What are these numbers based on?

245
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,441
The guy at the map store said it's
based on taste and how clear it looks.

246
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,276
That's subjective, isn't it?

247
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,823
"Water safety level, 100%."

248
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:34,990
100%?

249
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:39,120
A place where the water is
100% safe would be Heaven, right?

250
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,663
That's subjective.

251
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,250
I guess we could stop by, though.

252
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:47,962
Quiet! I hear footsteps.

253
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,633
Someone's in the building.

254
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,474
They're coming straight for us.

255
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,476
Do you think that gang has found us?

256
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,647
Sounds like just one guy.
We can probably handle it if we need to.

257
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:09,775
What are you gonna do if he's mega strong?

258
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:11,318
I know you're in there!

259
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,488
I was on the ship with you. Let me in.

260
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:20,911
I spotted you in the tent city
and followed you here.

261
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,664
I'll get straight to the point.

262
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,292
Will you protect me?

263
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,837
Well, if we're heading the same way,
I'll think about it.

264
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,048
I'm not going too far.

265
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,299
Just to the Immortal Order.

266
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:36,010
-Immortal Order?
-What's that?

267
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,971
Well, at least, that's what it's called.

268
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,640
But maybe it has a different name.

269
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,770
I heard there is a doctor
who can keep you alive forever.

270
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,022
A doctor. A doctor?

271
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,441
The doctor, is it this man?

272
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:54,987
Wait. I haven't been there, or met him.

273
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:56,197
Where is it?

274
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,202
If you don't tell me,
I won't be your bodyguard.

275
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,496
I can't take on the job
if you don't trust me.

276
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,208
I've trusted you since
I saw what you did on the ship.

277
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:11,712
I need you to protect me,
and the contents of this bag.

278
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:14,131
Those things that appeared
after the Great Disaster,

279
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:17,051
like that indestructible monstrosity
that attacked the ship--

280
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,845
If you transplant part of a monster
onto a human,

281
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,556
they become extremely powerful
and have immortal life.

282
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,350
Had you heard that before?

283
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:28,354
Don't tell me that bag you're carrying…

284
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:31,607
Don't take it from me.

285
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,818
Don't dare take it.

286
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:41,117
Isn't it rotting? It's all sloppy.

287
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:42,785
What?

288
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,831
It wasn't like this
before I got on the ship.

289
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:48,916
Don't chuck it everywhere!

290
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,504
Why?

291
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,008
After I finally got my hands on it.

292
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:01,429
Hey, pops.

293
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,931
Where is this Indestructible Order,
or whatever?

294
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,975
Wasn't it the Immortal Order?

295
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:09,395
I'll buy the information from you.

296
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:13,733
You can use the money
to find more Man-eater parts.

297
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,490
Let's get some of that 100% safe water,
then off to the Immortal Order.

298
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:23,826
Sorry, it's a bit of a detour.

299
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,494
Doesn't matter to me.

300
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:29,498
There's a chance the Immortal Order
could be where Heaven is too.

301
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,252
But, there's something a bit dodgy
about the location.

302
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:37,590
On the map, it just says "strange people."

303
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,345
Director! It's urgent!

304
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:44,305
Why are you crashing about like that?

305
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,515
Tarao has been cremated, but--

306
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,809
Deal with the rest yourself.

307
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,811
But you need to see this!

308
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,985
What on earth is going on?

309
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,496
What is it?
