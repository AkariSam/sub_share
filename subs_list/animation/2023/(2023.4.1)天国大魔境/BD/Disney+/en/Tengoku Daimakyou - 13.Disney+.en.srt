00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,121
{\an8}TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

2
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,165
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

3
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,849
The air is so hot, it's hard to breathe.

4
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,479
So this is the outside of the outside

5
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,897
the teacher was talking about?

6
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,067
Is this the test?

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,276
If it is,

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,155
at least the teachers can't be mad
at us for coming here.

9
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,240
You're right.

10
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,367
Should we go get the others?

11
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,203
No. Let's take a look first.

12
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,163
If this really is the test,

13
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,833
who goes first will probably
count towards our grades.

14
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:07,003
So what are we looking for?

15
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:10,423
Look. The wire fence is broken over there.

16
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,759
That means there must be
another outside beyond there.

17
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,303
Outside the outside of…

18
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,598
If we get as far as possible
to the final "outside", we'll win.

19
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,144
Win? Win what?

20
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,647
Well, I don't know.

21
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:34,822
Why did they have to
make it so hot in here?

22
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,660
What? There are big, flying bugs!

23
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,038
-Yikes!
-It's so hard to walk!

24
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,205
I get it!

25
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,166
Now it really feels like a test.

26
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,009
That's it,
I'm going back to tell everyone.

27
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,053
Anyway, I'm worried about Tokio.

28
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,637
Fine.

29
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,182
But I'm gonna keep going.

30
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:02,808
Okay.

31
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,727
What about you, Shiro?

32
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,442
There we go.

33
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,443
TOKIO Jr. - Jr. C

34
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:17,531
These two also agree
we should return the child to Tokio.

35
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,991
Thank you.

36
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,785
What?

37
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,703
How? There are two?

38
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,873
Tokio had twins?

39
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,792
It would seem so.

40
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,879
Dr. Sawatari, which one
are we returning to Tokio?

41
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,549
It's all under control. I know which one.

42
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,511
I put a mark on one of the feet.

43
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,929
I see.

44
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,847
Then, the one with the mark is…

45
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,727
That's the one we're returning to Tokio.

46
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,146
-All right, then--
-Wait, not that one!

47
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,690
What?

48
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,858
So which one is it?

49
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:59,740
The baby without the mark
is the one going back to Tokio!

50
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,536
Okay, got it.

51
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,373
-Are you okay?
-What do you mean?

52
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,500
There's no way I'd mix them up!

53
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,293
Of course everything is fine!

54
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,338
No. I just meant--
You're bleeding quite a lot.

55
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,008
-It's only a scratch!
-It is?

56
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,802
No, I mean-- Everything is fine!

57
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:24,348
Then can I leave
the one going back to Tokio with you?

58
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,683
Yes.

59
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,437
After I've checked
that the children are safe,

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,314
if possible, I'll use this situation

61
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,526
to execute the Noah Project.

62
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,737
The Noah Project?

63
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:43,492
What is it? Why is it called that?

64
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,244
Does nobody know about it?

65
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,746
I apologize.

66
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,498
I named it in the spur of the moment.

67
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,878
<i>It's the plan to protect the children.</i>

68
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,048
MITA CONDO

69
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:03,679
<i>It's not as if we agreed</i>
<i>exactly what day she'd be back.</i>

70
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,017
<i>If I finally found the guy</i>
<i>I'd been searching for for five years,</i>

71
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,062
<i>we'd probably</i>
<i>spend the whole night talking.</i>

72
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,190
<i>I guess we'd have a few drinks--</i>

73
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,733
<i>Well, I can't drink, but anyway.</i>

74
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,196
<i>We'd probably end up</i>
<i>sleeping all the next day.</i>

75
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,076
<i>But not coming back for another night</i>

76
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,328
<i>is a little…</i>

77
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,249
<i>Oops. The bottom's burnt.</i>

78
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,944
-Hey you!
-You there! Stop!

79
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,196
You can't go in there
without authorization.

80
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,991
A woman came this way two nights ago.

81
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,452
She hasn't returned,
so I've come to get her.

82
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:13,541
What? Isn't she Inazaki's old flame?

83
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,918
He told us not to let anyone in.

84
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,254
Go get authorization from the Ministry.

85
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,841
They must've rekindled their passion!

86
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,302
I was in the plant all day yesterday,

87
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,264
and they were just too much for me.

88
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:32,351
She'll come back eventually.
Just wait a bit--

89
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:35,187
Hey, you! We said no!

90
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,026
Hey, wait…

91
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,320
Wait!

92
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,208
LARGE FILTRATION PLANT

93
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,710
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

94
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,964
Who are you? You got authorization?

95
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,260
A bandit?

96
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,748
<i>Since Haruki's a deep sleeper.</i>

97
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,003
<i>What was that?</i>

98
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,967
<i>They can't possibly be my own memories</i>
<i>of seeing myself sleeping.</i>

99
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,136
<i>But…</i>

100
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:53,849
<i>I can recall all of those memories of Sis.</i>

101
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:01,774
<i>Was that one of my sister's memories</i>
<i>lingering in her body?</i>

102
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,902
<i>She could still be alive</i>

103
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,780
<i>somewhere in this body.</i>

104
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,284
<i>Maybe my mind is syncing with her body</i>

105
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,538
<i>and I'm slowly turning into my sister.</i>

106
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:20,918
<i>That would be great. I'd love that.</i>

107
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,423
It hurts.

108
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,468
<i>What was that look on Robin's face?</i>

109
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,887
<i>Something feels off.</i>

110
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,434
<i>That expression he had when he saw me.</i>
<i>What did it…</i>

111
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,644
<i>Stop.</i>

112
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,188
<i>I don't want to think about anything.</i>

113
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,775
<i>I just want to follow orders.</i>

114
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,653
Like Maru.

115
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,282
Maru!

116
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,950
Save me!

117
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,666
Sis?

118
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:03,961
Maru!

119
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,854
Hey! Somebody!

120
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,446
Maru! Maru!

121
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,969
What? You're alone?

122
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,597
You underestimate me!

123
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,519
I heard all about you.

124
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,815
Aren't you the guy Haruki's guarding?

125
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,901
Did Haruki also take care of you
down there?

126
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,365
What the hell are you looking at?

127
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,600
Don't mess with me, you damn kid!

128
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,963
THE JOURNEY CONTINUES AND BEGINS

129
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,013
Tokio? Tokio!

130
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:20,765
Let me.

131
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,143
Tokio! I'm opening the door!

132
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,730
Tokio!

133
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,814
Are you hurt?

134
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,066
No.

135
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,609
What happened?

136
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,652
We're trying to find out.

137
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,322
But there is something more important
I have to tell you.

138
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,075
This baby is your child.

139
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:40,159
What?

140
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,870
This baby grew inside you.

141
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,955
You gave birth to it, Tokio.

142
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:48,167
This baby is yours and Kona's.

143
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,798
We'll all think together
about how to raise the child,

144
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,218
but we thought we should
at least tell you the facts.

145
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:58,928
This is

146
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,554
a baby?

147
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,184
That thing you took out of me!

148
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,519
Exactly.

149
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,729
That's what all the hard work was for.

150
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:15,695
So cute.

151
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,572
Does Kona know?

152
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,492
-We need to show Kona.
-That's right.

153
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,994
Let's go and find him.

154
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:33,337
I won't give up. Not until I win!

155
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,672
Director!

156
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,507
You've returned?

157
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,385
As you can see, my timing is spot on.

158
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:43,222
But wait… You can walk?

159
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,182
Tokio!

160
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:48,310
Give the baby here.

161
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,479
Director!

162
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,565
Let's treat your wounds first.

163
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,650
Then I'll give you the baby.

164
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:55,943
What? Never!

165
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:57,695
No, Tokio!

166
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,321
Hey, Mina!

167
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:02,491
Take the baby away!

168
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,118
<i>Understood.</i>

169
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,750
-Please stop!
-Do it!

170
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,299
<i>What is this?</i>

171
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,135
<i>One of their faces is the same as yours.</i>

172
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,220
<i>Outside of the outside?</i>

173
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,972
There is an outside beyond here.

174
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:26,891
-What are you good at?
-Run away.

175
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:29,894
<i>What's happening?</i>

176
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,611
Stay away! Nobody come near me!

177
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,197
No, wait!

178
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,281
<i>Kona.</i>

179
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,033
<i>You</i>

180
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:45,618
<i>and I,</i>

181
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,454
<i>what exactly are we?</i>

182
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:03,094
I thought we'd be back
at the wire fence by now.

183
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,054
I don't see it anywhere.

184
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,722
That's weird.

185
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,601
We went straight ahead
and walked straight coming back, right?

186
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:13,104
I thought so too.

187
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,773
Let's keep going straight a bit more.

188
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,317
Even if we're going
in the wrong direction…

189
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,319
OUTSIDE OF THE OUTSIDE
WIRE FENCE - OUTSIDE - SCHOOL

190
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:23,489
…if we keep going straight,
we should reach it eventually.

191
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:26,492
Then we can follow the fence to get back.

192
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,576
You're right!

193
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:32,707
You're really talkative
when it's just the two of us.

194
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,458
Am I?

195
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:46,637
Hey, did we walk past a place this steep?

196
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,392
I can hear water.

197
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,645
I don't hear anything.

198
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:55,771
Let's go see.

199
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:59,567
Yeah. Anything but another tree
would make a good landmark.

200
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,447
That's so much water.

201
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,742
If it's flowing away from the school,

202
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,910
then the school must be upstream.

203
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,037
Makes sense.

204
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:13,622
Mimihime!

205
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,643
Shiro! Shiro!

206
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,941
Stop! Don't move!

207
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,860
Why?

208
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,987
Why did you do that just to save me?

209
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:53,704
Because I…

210
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:57,416
When I think about you--

211
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,252
Wait, no.

212
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,131
When I think about your body--

213
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,758
No, that's not it.

214
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:13,808
I really love you, Mimihime.

215
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,436
If it means I can save you,

216
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:22,525
I don't care how many times
I get cut to shreds.

217
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:26,404
If that's what you want.

218
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,656
Or rather,

219
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,991
if you'll let me.

220
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:02,898
Stop!

221
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:06,777
That's enough. Stop it.

222
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,405
Please.

223
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:11,907
Don't kill Robin.

224
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:40,936
Sorry.

225
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,689
I'm so weak.

226
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,901
Everything I believed in was all a lie.

227
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:52,823
I don't even know who I really am anymore.

228
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,536
If you took me apart
and put me back together again,

229
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,080
I'd probably disappear

230
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,416
and turn into my sister instead.

231
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:07,672
Sis.

232
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,549
You've already--

233
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:13,427
It feels like you've already dumped me
three or four times,

234
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:15,012
but let me say it again.

235
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:19,308
If you don't like it, just throw that rock
into the river and I'll stop.

236
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,979
I'm kinda--

237
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:27,692
I'm into girls.

238
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,444
If I'd have met the real Haruki,

239
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,239
we probably would've been friends,

240
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,492
but I don't think
I'd have fallen for him in that way.

241
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,953
And since you really like Kiriko,

242
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:42,498
she must be a really great person.

243
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,582
Yeah.

244
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,918
That's one thing I'm certain of.

245
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:51,215
But I don't know
if I'd have fallen for Kiriko either.

246
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:55,678
Hey…

247
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,765
you're the one I'm in love with!

248
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,645
Not Haruki or Kiriko. It's you!

249
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,522
You're strong!

250
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:10,526
You always take care of me! And the way
you see things is always right.

251
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,778
Without your help,

252
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:17,158
<i>I wouldn't be able to drive, cook</i>
<i>or even reheat food.</i>

253
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,535
<i>I can't do anything right without you.</i>

254
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,999
But if you're ever in danger,

255
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,418
I'll protect you!

256
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,004
I'll make sure

257
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:32,965
to always keep you safe.

258
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,344
What?

259
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,556
What's the point of my existence

260
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,933
if I'm the one getting protected?

261
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,101
I know, I know!

262
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:45,978
You're my guard.

263
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:48,564
Hey! Your snot is getting on me!

264
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,863
When I was a kid…

265
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,742
…I used to hiccup like this
every time I cried.

266
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,495
It takes me back.

267
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,963
Now I've met him
and finished what I set out to do,

268
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,632
I don't need this.

269
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,309
<i>Robin Inazaki,</i>

270
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:29,105
<i>if I ever see you again,</i>

271
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:30,898
<i>I'm going to</i>

272
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:32,900
<i>kill you!</i>

273
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:38,406
What do you mean nobody's here?

274
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:40,241
Not sure.

275
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,993
I couldn't get in contact
with anyone at the plant.

276
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:45,830
When I came to see what was going on,
it was deserted.

277
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,916
Is this coffee?

278
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,710
What a waste.

279
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,546
Sir! I found a set of keys.

280
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,841
And those are bloodstains?

281
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,051
What happened here?

282
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,179
This is the only locked room.

283
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,764
Open it.

284
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:08,853
It's dark.

285
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,609
What is that?

286
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:18,654
A monster is attached to a human?

287
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:19,905
That woman!

288
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:23,951
I remember she registered as a resident
about three months ago.

289
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:27,288
Her mind is completely gone.

290
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:37,381
What the hell was Inazaki doing here?

291
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,521
-Okay. Shall we go?
-You sure?

292
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:55,566
I can't stay depressed forever.

293
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,693
Our goal is Heaven.

294
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:59,236
Our mission hasn't changed.

295
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,740
Besides, you'll protect me
when it's dangerous, right?

296
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,201
I will.

297
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:08,996
And you'll save me when I'm in trouble.

298
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:17,838
Again?

299
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:21,092
It's so embarrassing to stall
just when we're making a dramatic exit!

300
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:23,636
There's no one here, so it doesn't count!

301
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:24,970
It's not my fault!

302
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:27,014
Go complain to the Kirukomaru!
