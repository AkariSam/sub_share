1
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,121
{\an8}TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO
Push Start!

2
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,165
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

3
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,554
What? It floats into the sky
and shoots out light?

4
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:38,015
What kind of face does it have?

5
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,811
Don't ask me everything.
Imagine for yourself, Kona.

6
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,771
Close your eyes,

7
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,357
and focus on what comes to mind.
Look at it closely.

8
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,654
It might be something you think
you saw out of the corner of your eye,

9
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,781
or an optical illusion.

10
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,491
But let it fill your senses. Follow it.

11
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,416
Did you see something?

12
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,252
A sword of light?

13
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,214
-Michika?
-Blood.

14
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,300
What's happened?

15
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,886
-Michika suddenly started bleeding.
-Get the teacher!

16
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,596
It's a deep cut.

17
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,891
No one even touched Michika.
It came out of nowhere.

18
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,311
Michika, please stay still.

19
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:34,155
It's not perfect, so please rest, okay?

20
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,211
Kona? Kona.

21
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,716
What? Asura?

22
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,844
When did you come in?

23
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,767
-Oh, no!
-A power outage?

24
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,936
No, wait. It's just the camera monitors.

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,396
Restart them!

26
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,523
CAMERAS ARE NOT RESPONDING

27
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:13,778
Now I understand why I was born.

28
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,655
So I have come to say goodbye.

29
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,823
What?

30
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,076
Asura?

31
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,160
Asura!

32
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,913
Asura, where are you?

33
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,581
Asura.

34
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,947
Asura!

35
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,963
<i>The adults are on their way.</i>

36
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,382
<i>Go back to your room, Kona.</i>

37
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,634
Asura, don't go!

38
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,137
I'll be all alone!

39
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,556
<i>You are not alone.</i>

40
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:28,019
<i>You have Anzu, Tokio and Mimihime.</i>

41
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,604
<i>Even Nanaki, Iwa and the others.</i>

42
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,815
<i>You will find more and more friends.</i>

43
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,193
<i>Kona, find someone that you love.</i>

44
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,446
But I love you, Asura!

45
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:42,616
<i>It's a different kind of love.</i>
<i>An even more special feeling.</i>

46
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,494
<i>Open your heart to it.</i>

47
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,048
Kona seems lonely.

48
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,968
Kona is the only one left in his year now.

49
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,679
I'll be right back.

50
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,348
Tokio!

51
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,691
What is it, Tokio?

52
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:18,444
It's nothing important…

53
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,032
but I just thought I'd come over here.

54
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,161
You're so good at drawing.

55
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,336
Thank you.

56
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,935
Whoever killed Asura,

57
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,604
is coming to take Tokio away next.

58
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,107
CHILDREN OF THE NURSERY

59
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,283
That was so close.

60
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:10,413
{\an8}They are the group of 14-year-olds.

61
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,664
{\an8}That's great.

62
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,836
<i>Tokio? Could it be?</i>

63
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,424
And a group of 15 five-year-olds
will join the nursery.

64
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,926
They will probably be the last.

65
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,305
Oh, Miss Aoshima, what are you doing?

66
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,640
I need you to interpret.

67
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,308
Sorry.

68
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:37,523
Usami was holding this button.
It has the same logo as Kiru-Beam.

69
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,526
It can't just be a coincidence.

70
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,572
<i>Since you only have a vague idea</i>
<i>of where you're trying to go,</i>

71
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,949
<i>I think tracking down this logo</i>
<i>is a good idea.</i>

72
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,411
So the next place we need to go is--

73
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,122
The town where Usami used to live?

74
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,457
That's the one.

75
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,543
I thought we'd be going that way
with Usami,

76
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,129
so I didn't see
where he pointed on the map.

77
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:03,632
Everyone else went off that way.

78
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:06,719
Yeah, but if they turned off
here or there…

79
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,723
If they did that,
then there are endless possibilities.

80
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,476
Don't make it sound like a good thing.

81
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,228
Well, either way,
we've just got to try to get there.

82
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,856
Oh, and by the way, look.

83
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,984
The tooth that fell out.
It's growing back.

84
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,570
What's going on with your body?

85
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,994
-An earthquake.
-It's a big one.

86
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,163
Whoa!

87
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,749
Careful! If the ground swallows you up,
you're done for.

88
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,092
There hasn't been an earthquake in ages.

89
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,346
That must be a building falling nearby.

90
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,972
-Let's go.
-What for?

91
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,433
When a building falls down,

92
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,936
you can get into any room.
It's a total jackpot.

93
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,731
If it's near the town we're looking for,
resource collectors might show up.

94
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,984
You wanna grab anything worth stealing
before those guys?

95
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,821
You idiot. They can take us
to the place we're looking for.

96
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,870
It didn't collapse completely.
It'll be dangerous.

97
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,667
We can get in this way.

98
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,836
Give it up. If it caves in, we'll die.

99
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,010
What the hell? Someone's living in there!

100
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,053
Oh, wow, are you okay?

101
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,180
You did well to survive.

102
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,183
No, no. I don't live there.

103
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,811
I came to have a look
to see if there are any resources.

104
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,855
Looks like you beat us to it.

105
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:41,981
Sorry.

106
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:47,028
I couldn't get in at all,
and I don't have anything either.

107
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,779
Can you let it slide?

108
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,573
What are you so nervous for?

109
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,993
Well, from the look of you,
aren't you guys bandits?

110
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,705
Who you calling bandits?

111
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,124
You stink of bandits way more than us!

112
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,250
I-I'm sorr…

113
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,586
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

114
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,255
Please excuse me
for calling you here so suddenly.

115
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,134
It's okay. I've been anxious
about my health recently too.

116
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,719
Thank you for checking up on me.

117
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,264
Everything seems perfectly okay,
so no need to worry.

118
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,309
For now, just try not to catch a chill.

119
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,603
And don't do any strenuous activity.

120
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,106
Okay. I won't.

121
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,153
Mimihime.

122
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,322
You made me jump.

123
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,157
Don't sneak up on me like that.

124
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:37,286
You're always
looking at something up there.

125
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,622
And you're always looking at me.

126
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,960
Is it the ceiling?

127
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,630
It's something floating
in front of the ceiling.

128
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:49,340
Dust?

129
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,051
If you're talking about
specks of light floating about,

130
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,136
they're particles
in your eyes' vitreous fluid.

131
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,556
Anyway, let's go. Class is about to start.

132
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,061
I see.

133
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,771
Just as I thought.

134
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,982
I'm the only one who can see it.

135
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,111
It's creepy.

136
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,738
Really? Can no one else see that?

137
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,034
<i>Is everyone present?</i>

138
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,953
Tokio isn't here yet.

139
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,539
<i>Before class begins,</i>

140
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,208
<i>I need to inform you</i>
<i>of something about Tokio.</i>

141
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,629
-<i>You may not see Tokio for some time.</i>
-What?

142
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,299
<i>But, of course, you will meet again.</i>

143
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,803
<i>Please don't worry.</i>

144
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,017
<i>Let's begin the class.</i>

145
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,311
There.

146
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:50,484
Must be nice to have a car that works.

147
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:54,739
It's not as useful as you might think,
when the roads are such a mess.

148
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:56,699
Well, I'm all set then.

149
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,534
Isn't it dangerous by yourself?

150
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,623
Worst-case scenario, I've got this.

151
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,377
You had something that dangerous
hidden under your raincoat?

152
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,796
Well, isn't that a gun?

153
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,881
Something like that.

154
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:14,925
Hey, is there a town somewhere round here?

155
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:18,012
Information is a commodity, you know.

156
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,056
If it's money you want, we'll pay.

157
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,850
In any case,
do either of these guys, this logo,

158
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:27,021
or the word "heaven" mean anything to you?

159
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,109
Wait there a minute.

160
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:36,072
I just need to move the car a bit.
Can you step back?

161
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,870
A bit further! A bit more!

162
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,174
There. Now we can talk properly.

163
00:11:55,257 --> 00:12:00,137
I get the feeling
I might know where that logo comes from.

164
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,597
Oh, really?

165
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:04,141
I'll tell you in exchange for the gun.

166
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,685
It's not for sale.

167
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,436
In that case, money will do.

168
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,146
That was easy.

169
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,149
Well, there's no point complaining
and getting myself killed.

170
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:17,029
But it may
take me a little while to remember.

171
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,617
{\an8}I make a living
selling the information I have.

172
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,286
{\an8}I'm sure once I get talking
it'll jog my memory.

173
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,622
This guy is really milking it.

174
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,125
Just tell us
whichever one you think is best.

175
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:33,838
Good evening, everyone.

176
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,257
I have returned once more.

177
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,260
I, Juichi, am here to tell you

178
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,929
stories that may have really happened.

179
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:43,848
It's still daytime.

180
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,102
There are various rumors
about what caused the Great Disaster.

181
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,855
But why does the cause remain so unclear?

182
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,983
Because the subsequent earthquakes,
the abnormally long winters,

183
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:57,153
the famine and disease, led humanity
towards the edge of extinction,

184
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:00,448
<i>making it impossible to trace back</i>
<i>to what originally happened.</i>

185
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,366
<i>These three theories persist.</i>

186
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,201
1 ASTEROID IMPACT
2 ALIEN INVASION - 3 WAR THEORY

187
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,704
<i>First is the asteroid impact theory.</i>

188
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,791
<i>Before the Great Disaster,</i>
<i>people were making a lot of noise</i>

189
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,294
<i>about the discovery</i>
<i>of an asteroid drawing closer to Earth.</i>

190
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,297
<i>The sheer scale of the disaster</i>
<i>makes this theory a strong one.</i>

191
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,550
Next, the alien invasion theory.

192
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:23,804
It may seem absurd at first,
but some people think

193
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,475
that those man-eating life-forms
came to Earth from space.

194
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:29,685
<i>Before the Great Disaster occurred,</i>

195
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,564
<i>many people witnessed</i>
<i>mysterious figures floating in the sky.</i>

196
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:37,693
I managed to get hold
of this precious image from back then.

197
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:38,861
That's a bird.

198
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,238
Finally, the war theory.

199
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,199
<i>There is a rumor</i>
<i>that before the Great Disaster,</i>

200
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,452
<i>there was a terrorist attack</i>
<i>somewhere in Japan.</i>

201
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,163
<i>The theory goes that</i>
<i>this caused an outbreak of war</i>

202
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,583
<i>and the use</i>
<i>of some sort of special weapon.</i>

203
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,711
So, how was the story?

204
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,214
Well, let's meet again sometime
for another story.

205
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,424
See you. Bye-bye.

206
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,426
It's not "See you. Bye-bye"!

207
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,804
Did you remember anything
about the logo or not?

208
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:08,557
Oops. Maybe if I keep talking
it'll come back to me.

209
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,643
I knew you'd say that!

210
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:14,063
Cool it, Sis.
Let's just hear one more, at least.

211
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,523
MENU - GREAT DISASTER
TRUE GHOST STORIES

212
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,817
Tell us one of the true ghost stories.
"The Walled Town."

213
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,276
Thank you.

214
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:22,113
Then let's get back to it.

215
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,616
This story is one of my own,
experienced firsthand.

216
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,160
For ten years, from the age of 12,

217
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:32,456
<i>I was shut up in a school</i>
<i>surrounded by walls.</i>

218
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,877
I apologize for calling
an emergency meeting with everyone.

219
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:41,382
Mina will send out meeting minutes
to the departments who cannot attend.

220
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,803
First, in regards to the ongoing
search for an assistant director,

221
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,806
I would like to ask Miss Aoshima
to take up the position.

222
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:58,274
Miss Aoshima will be given
level-four access rights.

223
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,734
Hold on one second.

224
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,361
Why is Aoshima being promoted?

225
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:06,574
Because Miss Aoshima
is the one I can trust the most.

226
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:14,373
But Dr. Sawatari was supposed to be
the most likely future director.

227
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:16,751
This is not going to go down well.

228
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,836
Madame Takeuchi too.

229
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:24,842
That town was a place where women ruled.

230
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:29,930
There were around 30 women,
mostly between the ages of 20 and 40.

231
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:34,435
<i>The school was their stronghold,</i>
<i>and they barricaded it in.</i>

232
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,356
<i>Any man who accidentally approached it</i>
<i>would be killed.</i>

233
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,233
<i>However, in rare cases,</i>

234
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,694
<i>if they thought the man was healthy</i>
<i>and liked his face,</i>

235
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:47,198
<i>they would imprison him in the town,</i>
<i>keeping him as a "breeding pig."</i>

236
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,828
I spent ten years
in that town, as Boar #11.

237
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:57,833
<i>The breeding pigs would perform tasks</i>
<i>and provide the women with sperm.</i>

238
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:03,339
<i>When it was my turn,</i>
<i>one couple kept asking for me.</i>

239
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,842
<i>Eventually, one of them fell pregnant.</i>

240
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:11,347
<i>If a girl was born, she would be accepted</i>
<i>into the town as a human.</i>

241
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,809
<i>But if it was a boy,</i>
<i>he would be taken from his mother</i>

242
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,353
<i>and raised by us as a breeding pig.</i>

243
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,649
<i>It was a boy.</i>

244
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,570
<i>One night, about six months later,</i>
<i>that couple hatched a plan.</i>

245
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,865
<i>The four of us</i>
<i>would flee the town together.</i>

246
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:31,617
Yeah! Good for you!

247
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:34,870
<i>But they found us…</i>

248
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,709
<i>and only I barely managed to escape.</i>

249
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,504
<i>The next day,</i>

250
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,842
<i>the couple's slaughtered corpses</i>
<i>had been strung up outside the town walls.</i>

251
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,469
<i>About one year has passed since then.</i>

252
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,932
<i>That such a terrifying place</i>
<i>can even exist in this world, is…</i>

253
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,936
So let's meet again sometime
for another story.

254
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,564
See you. Bye-bye.

255
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,566
It's not "See you. Bye bye"!

256
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,693
What happened to the baby?

257
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:06,819
I don't know.

258
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,113
What a gruesome story.

259
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:13,951
Sis, can't you go check somehow?
To see if the baby is at least alive?

260
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,828
If the story is even true…

261
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:25,880
I suppose you did tell us a story,
so I won't take the money back.

262
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,924
But you better get lost before I kill you.

263
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,885
I-I'm sorry!

264
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:33,346
What was that for?

265
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:34,889
He didn't tell us about the logo yet.

266
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,432
He didn't need to.

267
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,809
That guy was acting really strange.

268
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,395
<i>Even though</i>
<i>the driver's seat is on the right,</i>

269
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,647
<i>he went to the effort</i>
<i>to repark his car to the right.</i>

270
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:45,149
In the first place,

271
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:50,237
why park your car so close to the wall,
when there's no one around here?

272
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,409
There was a reason
he needed to move it so quickly.

273
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,245
He spotted something
that he wanted to hide.

274
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,207
2F - TAKA

275
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,126
TAKAHARA ACADEMY

276
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,836
It's the logo on the Kiru-Beam.

277
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,841
We nearly wasted all our time
and money on that endless storytelling.

278
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,594
But we found it.

279
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,097
The origin of the symbol.

280
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,602
TAKAHARA ACADEMY

281
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,154
That box!

282
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,825
You found it.

283
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,702
You really are an odd-job girl.

284
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:44,542
We found the Kiru-Beam logo,

285
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:48,129
but if this is heaven,
isn't it really just a normal building?

286
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:50,214
Let's look around some more.

287
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:58,472
Someone's already
scavenged through all this stuff.

288
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,864
"Welcome message from the Director.

289
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:20,578
At Takahara Academy, there is a space
where you can rest both body and mind.

290
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,914
There is time
to immerse yourself in your hobbies,

291
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,043
and people who will listen to you
in times of stress."

292
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:28,127
HELL OF PATIENCE

293
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:32,381
Just one more thing I don't understand
about life before the Great Disaster.

294
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:36,886
Seems like an orphanage you can go to
even if you have a family and home…

295
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,471
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION
TAKAHARA ACADEMY

296
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,431
{\an8}…and it's also a cram school?

297
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,937
The heaven-like civilization
of that period sounds like hard work.

298
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,860
Well, maybe not all that bad.

299
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:56,614
With a few friends,
maybe I'd have the patience for it.

300
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,285
Sis! Will you come here?

301
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,246
TAKAHARA ACADEMY

302
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,250
Was this floor
part of Takahara Academy too?

303
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,171
Over here.

304
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,136
Another weird bird mark.

305
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,474
But it just looks like someone
made a graffiti version of the other one.

306
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,518
I bet bandits lived here at some point.

307
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,395
I'm not sure how,

308
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,731
but I get the feeling this place
isn't the one I've been searching for.

309
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,942
And there's no one here who looks like me.

310
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:37,863
I got all excited after we traced the logo
on the gun to this place,

311
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,283
but there's also the possibility

312
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:44,078
that the gun and the place I'm looking for
never had any connection.

313
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,331
What's this?

314
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:52,044
It seems that Takahara Academy
was some kind of orphanage.

315
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:57,049
And in that guide, it describes the world
as a "Hell of Patience."

316
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,969
And what's the opposite of hell, Maru?

317
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,721
Heaven.

318
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,933
So if the symbol
and this academy are related to heaven,

319
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:08,352
I still think
it's worth following this lead.

320
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:09,437
CONTACT NUMBERS

321
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,604
According to the leaflet,

322
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:13,441
Takahara Academy has two facilities
and 18 branches.

323
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,069
I guess the other branches
could be similar to this one.

324
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,739
I'm more curious about the two facilities.

325
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,075
Ibaraki and Nara?

326
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,787
It seems like an okay place to sleep.
Should we stay here tonight?

327
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:29,832
No. Let's find somewhere else.

328
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,043
This place gives me the shivers.

329
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,007
Let's get onto the main topic.

330
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,510
We have discovered that Tokio is pregnant.

331
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,097
-What?
-B-B-But that's outrageous!

332
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:46,849
At that young age!

333
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,017
That's not the issue.

334
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:50,269
The real question is the father!

335
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,980
-Who is the father?
-Director?

336
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,482
It's under investigation!

337
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,028
We never taught them the concept of sex,

338
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,113
or the distinction
between male and female.

339
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:02,907
And now, in these crucial final moments…

340
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,869
This could shake up
the entire Takahara Academy!

341
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,455
<i>We are in a state of crisis!</i>
