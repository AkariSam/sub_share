1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:02,378
What?

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,463
Where are my pants? Where did they go?

3
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:07,383
Better get a move on.
I'm gonna be late for the test!

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,467
I give up.

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,097
What? My pajama pants are gone too.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,224
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

7
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,062
<i>Today is Friday, July 26. Ten'ei 18.</i>

8
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:23,107
Oh, right! I'll just borrow
them from Mimihime!

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,362
What?

10
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:37,288
<i>Everyone! Do you want to go</i>
<i>outside of the outside?</i>

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,707
-Yes! I do!
-What?

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,585
-I want to.
-Then, I do too!

13
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,045
Me too.

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,381
<i>Then we will begin the test.</i>

15
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:01,687
What a weird dream.

16
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,399
My hair is so short!

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,403
Oh, right. I had it cut yesterday.

18
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,322
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:16,118
<i>Today is Friday, July 26. Ten'ei 18.</i>

20
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,540
<i>The same date as in my dream.</i>

21
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,461
Hey, why are you so depressed lately?

22
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,506
We still don't know anything
about the test.

23
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,967
Yeah, but Tokio's coming back today!

24
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:35,012
Yeah, we get to hang out with Tokio again.

25
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,305
Danger.

26
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,516
-What?
-Danger.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,143
-Danger.
-Danger.

28
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,978
Danger. Danger.

29
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,398
<i>Access failed.</i>

30
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,859
Most of Mina's systems are down.

31
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,861
Looks like the terminal still works.

32
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,072
Can't we use that instead?

33
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,033
I've been trying that, but…

34
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,118
SANCTUM

-Hello? Can you hear me?
-<i>Access failed.</i>

42
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,681
Hey! Hello?

43
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,944
It really is dangerous!

00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,151

TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

46
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,308
Wait, this area…

47
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,186
It kind of smells like food.

48
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,653
FISH - MEAT - SAKE

49
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,948
-For real?
-It's a market!

50
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,993
{\an8}It's way bigger than just a "settlement."

51
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,370
Why have so many people come
to this place?

52
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,455
FUEL - FISH - FOOD GRADE MEAT

53
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,499
It's as booming as the Asakusa Racecourse.

54
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,667
FOOD GRADE MEAT - DRIED MEAT

55
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,298
{\an8}SALTED MEAT AND POTATO SOUP

56
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,384
Since we're here, wanna eat? Sis?

57
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:03,387
-Come and look!
-Please come again!

58
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:04,722
Good idea.

59
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,350
If this is a dream,
better eat before we wake up.

60
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,353
Excuse me,
two portions of this one, please.

61
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,437
Sure.

{\an8}ASAKUSA OKONOMIYAKI

63
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,859
It's illegal to use
the old paper money here.

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,570
Don't you have any chips?

65
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,821
Chips?

66
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,782
It's the town's currency.

67
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,035
If you register as a visitor,
you'll get five chips each.

68
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,119
For free?

69
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,413
-Where do we need to go?
-The Ministry of Reconstruction.

70
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,998
The Ministry of Reconstruction?

71
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,833
There's really
a Ministry of Reconstruction?

72
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,504
MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION

73
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,589
<i>So it really exists.</i>

74
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,008
<i>What's the Ministry of Reconstruction?</i>

75
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,426
<i>You've never heard of it?</i>

76
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,511

JOB BOARD

79
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,352
<i>They're hiring engineers</i>

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,523

RESIDENTS ONLY - RECEPTION

83
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,192
<i>That might be true.</i>

84
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,986
<i>But this town has actually been restored.</i>

85
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,823
<i>Maybe it's not a shady organization, then.</i>

86
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>Well, rumors always get exaggerated.</i>

87
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,995
Are you travelers?

88
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,080
Yes, exactly.

89
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,248
Can we have some chips?

90
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,885

Okay, you're all set.

93
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,401
This is the currency for the town.

94
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,571
Don't take notice of the different colors.

95
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,864
They're all the same.

96
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,158
-Let's take this and go eat!
-And this is--

97
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,617
Actually, I've got a question.

98
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,163
You have every resident's face
on record, right?

99
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,540
Do you know the man in this picture?

100
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,834
Or this face?

101
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,170
Oh, my.

102
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,382
This man. What's his name?

103
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,512
Robin Inazaki.

104
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,643
How do you know him?

105
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,229
I-Is Robin here?

106
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,648
Let me see him!

107
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,317
We're friends! No, we're family!

108
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,280
<i>Do you mind calling to ask?</i>

109
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:27,948
Sure.

110
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,452
This is the Ministry of Reconstruction.

111
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,372
Please tell the chief he has a guest.

112
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,501
She has his photo
and says she's a family member.

113
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,378
She didn't leave a last name,

114
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,047
but it's a young woman called Kiruko.

115
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,219
Yes, thank you.

116
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,179
I'll let her know.

117
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,183
I made an appointment for you.

118
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,353
It's in two hours
at the Large Filtration Plant.

119
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,566
But, where's the Large Filtration Plant?

120
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,405
That's the Large Filtration Plant
across the river.

121
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,783
That's exactly where
Takahara Academy's Ibaraki Facility is.

122
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,663
The appointment's not for two hours,
so we'll have to sleep round here tonight.

123
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:17,707
RENTAL 0021

124
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,625
Oh, I see.

125
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:23,879
We need to hang this up outside
wherever we decide to sleep.

126
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:28,342
So if you see one of these,
there's already someone living there.

127
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,681
Let's stay here!
Looks like no one's using it.

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,436
How sophisticated.

129
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,104
It feels so civilized.

130
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,356
When people gather together in one place,

131
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,609
it creates a totally different lifestyle
to scavenging around.

132
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,321
I guess people are gonna gather
in one place like this more and more,

133
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:53,784
fixing and rebuilding stuff,
rather than squandering all the resources.

134
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:59,373
Sis, you're talking to yourself a lot.
You're being weird.

135
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,587
It's okay. You want to go alone, right?

136
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,591
Sorry. I'm supposed to be your bodyguard.

137
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,054
And you're the reason
we were heading to that place.

138
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:17,016
The guy you've been looking for
all these years could be there.

139
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,726
It's not your fault.

140
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,979
Go and take a look first.

141
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:25,775
I'll be back,
so make sure you wait for me.

00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,235
Robin.

145
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:10,820
Robin.

146
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,246
Robin!

147
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,773
What? What happened?

148
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:53,946
Is this the "Spear of Heaven"
the Director spoke of?

149
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,824
What is this?

150
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,576
Did a plane fall on us?

151
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,703
I'm sure I saw it for a split second.

152
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,622
It's an attack on Takahara!

153
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,541
To the back of the building! Hurry!

154
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:10,212
It's as if they were
waiting for me to return!

155
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,513
Shiro!

156
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,558
It's nothing.

157
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,393
Hey, you okay?

158
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,020
Let's get out of here.

159
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,673
Hey, nobody from Michika's year is here!

160
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,508
They should've been in swim class.

161
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,551
That's right.

162
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,429
Everyone, take cover at the pool!

163
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,682
That's probably the safest spot.

164
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,767
You're not coming with us, Mimihime?

165
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,689
There's something I want to check out.

166
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,107
The wall, right?

167
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,068
Right. There was a hole in the wall.

168
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,029
You all saw it too?

169
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,197
Let's go together.

170
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,199
Okay.

171
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:24,495
I'm gonna look for Tokio
after taking them to safety.

172
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,579
Okay.

173
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,540
Then I'll see you at the pool.

174
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:38,300
Push the chair! Quickly!

175
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,012
Geez.

176
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,597
You're so useless!

177
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,767
<i>You can run?</i>

178
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:00,823
Which one's which? I can't tell!

179
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,826
Wait. Wait.

180
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:08,914
I can just test them
when the system comes back online.

181
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:16,422
All right.

182
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,633
What's going on?

183
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,345
We're investigating it!

184
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,265
Is it over?

185
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,394
Look at this mess.

186
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,355
Maybe something exploded?

187
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,607
Let's ask the teachers later.

188
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,026
Let's take a look at that hole first.

189
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:41,572
I've always wondered if there
was something beyond the wall.

190
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,657
Me too.

191
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,161
TAKAHARA ACADEMY
IBARAKI FACILITY

192
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,459
Sorry for the wait.

193
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:56,712
Robin!

194
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,381
What are you doing here, Robin?

195
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,590
Why haven't--

196
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:00,925
What about the orphanage?

197
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,218
Calm down.

198
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,345
Let's take our time talking.

199
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:07,348
We both have a lot of questions.

200
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:17,358
Still, I can't just believe
something like that immediately.

201
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,946
How could your mind be in Kiriko's body?

202
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm looking at Kiriko
when I'm talking to you like this.

203
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,494
But your expressions
are just like Haruki's.

204
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,621
They're Haruki's facial tics.

205
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:35,084
You've got Kiriko's voice.
But the way you speak is like Haruki.

206
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:39,588
I see. Your mind, huh?

207
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,384
But Sakota could definitely do it.

208
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,803
Sakota? Is that the Doc?

209
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,638
Do you know where he is?

210
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,224
Nope. No clue.

211
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:55,104
I left Asakusa looking for him.
But I lost him.

212
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,275
And Funayama Orphanage was gone
by the time I came back to Asakusa.

213
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,277
Then a bunch of other things happened.

214
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,989
-I met Usami.
-Really?

215
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,659
Is the person
who was with Usami still alive?

216
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,247
She was when we first met.

217
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,843
I was staying at Usami's place
until two years ago.

218
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,887
Then I found this place.

219
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,431
What is this place?

220
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,768
There's a bunch of documents
that look like plant research.

221
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,978
You're pretty smart.

222
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:39,440
It seems that, before the Great Disaster,
they genetically engineered plants

223
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,152
to make them edible
and resistant to harsh climates.

224
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:45,780
Look.

225
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,700
They started growing like crazy
once we fixed up the fields.

226
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,952
Then people started settling here.

227
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:55,664
And among those people--
You saw them, right?

228
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,875
Some guys from
the Ministry of Reconstruction.

229
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,878
After that,
it quickly turned into a real town.

230
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:03,756
{\an8}AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

231
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,425
{\an8}This place is called
the Large Filtration Plant

232
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:11,847
{\an8}because we fixed it up so that we can
manually filter the water from the river.

233
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:17,103
The Ministry also got the plant
to boil water and generate power.

234
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,648
That's where all the electricity
used in this facility comes from.

235
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,528
It's getting cold.

236
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:27,822
HOT BATH

237
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,491
Take a bath before you go.
I already filled the tub.

238
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:31,742
I still have questions!

239
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:32,952
I know.

240
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:35,788
It's been five years.

241
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,665
Let's take our time.

242
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,297
O-Okay.

243
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,592
Let's play rock, paper, scissors
to choose who goes to look.

244
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,927
Mimihime!

245
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:09,780
When you shower, run the cold water,
then add hot water slowly.

246
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:12,825
You'll burn yourself if you
start with the hot water.

247
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:14,577
Got it.

248
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,707
<i>I knew Robin was amazing.</i>

249
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:31,010
<i>He was able to make a town</i>
<i>that has both water and food.</i>

250
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,346
<i>It's like heaven.</i>

251
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,519
<i>I was afraid.</i>

252
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:42,772
<i>I was so scared.</i>

253
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,274
<i>But it's fine now.</i>

254
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:48,194
<i>Now…</i>

255
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,739
<i>I'll have Robin.</i>

256
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:59,330
Will Sis be okay without this?

257
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,008
Wow! There are two hair dryers!

258
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:12,760
I'm dual wielding!

259
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,388
What?

260
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,558
Robin! My clothes are gone!

261
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,771
Hey! I've warmed up the room.
Just come like that.

262
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,417
Kiriko.

263
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,419
No, you're Haruki.

264
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,047
You're both really interesting kids.

265
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:01,726
From the bottom of my heart,

266
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,811
I'm truly happy I picked you both up.

267
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,619
What is this place?

268
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,291
Inside the school's outer wall

269
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,626
is another outside!

270
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,172
Oh, wow!

271
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,549
The ceiling is

272
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,384
so high!

273
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,140
I thought I was falling up.

274
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,771
Thanks for your business!

275
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,607
{\an8}SALTED MEAT AND POTATO SOUP
YUMMY DELICIOUS SOUP

276
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,941
PLEASURE BAR

277
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,569
Hey, handsome, how about a drink?

278
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,489
You can bring that in with you.

279
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,493
No, thanks. I'm gonna eat at home.

280
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,083
Can I even eat all this by myself?

281
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:16,384
You've grown so much
since we last saw each other.

282
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:21,514
You're covered in scars.
It must've been hard.

283
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,517
Robin! What is this? Stop it!

284
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,270
What? I'm just conducting
a small experiment.

285
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:32,650
Who's inside this head of yours?

286
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,652
I said. It's me!

287
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,487
Say your name.

288
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,031
It's Haruki!

289
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:41,409
Really?

290
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,829
All right. Take a look in the mirror.

291
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,879
Who's on the bed with me?

292
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,883
Who is that girl?

293
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,845
S-Sis.

294
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:04,181
Right! It's the sister you love so much.

295
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:07,351
She's about to be held by another man.

296
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,437
Shouldn't you save her?

297
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,772
Stop it.

298
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,441
Robin, why are you…

299
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:19,280
Now, whose body am I touching?

300
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:21,073
Tell me, Haruki.

301
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,868
Robin…

302
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,286
Haruki.

303
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,455
HARUKI TAKEHAYA - GENDER
AGE: 18 - BLOOD TYPE

304
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,832
Robin!

305
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:35,629
No.

306
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,383
Not me. Look in the mirror, Haruki.

307
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:43,846
Watch what I'm gonna do to your sister.

308
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:02,365
It's so blue and dazzling.

309
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,746
<i>It's so pretty.</i>

310
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:09,830
OUTSIDE OF THE OUTSIDE
