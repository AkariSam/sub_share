-Come back!
-Stop there!

00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,499
Takehaya?

12
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,669
Damn it.

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,881
Don't chase them too far! Haruki!

14
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,854
Let's get the hell outta here.

15
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:04,982
But that little brat has seen our faces.

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,365
What?

17
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,706
Looks like you've been looking after
our young lad, huh?

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,251

Did you think you could kill me
with a tiny scrap of metal?

22
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:14,653
Haruki, when you fight your enemies,
you don't need to stare into their eyes.

23
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,239
Glaring is just something cowards do

24
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:20,951
when they want to get away
with only intimidating their opponents.

25
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,955
Avoid the eyes,
and concentrate on the collar instead.

26
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,460
Then focus on the ground,
check how it feels beneath your feet.

27
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,383
Those who do nothing
but look at their opponents, lose.

28
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,511
Let's hand these guys over to the boss.

29
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,430
Nice going, Haruki.

30
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,683
If you want something, just ask me.

31
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,648
We're back!

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,525
What meat is that?

33
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,778
Monkey, crow and mouse. I think.

34
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,408
Wow, cool jacket!

35
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,701
Robin gave it to me.

36
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,619
It's a little baggy.

37
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,996
He'll grow into it quickly, though!

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,667
Now I want something too.

39
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,087
How about trousers?
Bet they'll fit if you cut them in half.

40
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,965
My legs are not that short!

41
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,968
I'm hungry.

42
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,137
Sis, you're back!

43
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,347
Where did you finish?

44
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,308
Didn't you see? I was disqualified.
I fell out of my kart.

45
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,269
What? Did you hurt yourself?

46
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,980
No, I'm okay.
The other drivers went around me.

47
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,940
Right, Doc?

48
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,401
That's so dangerous.
You gotta be more careful!

49
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,945
You really should drive more safely.

50
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,530
I get it, I get it.

00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:43,284
Oh, yeah, Kiriko.

53
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,205
I attached a flash to my camera.

54
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,583
Let's take some new photos to sell.

55
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,419
Take one of me and Doc, then.

56
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,837
I'm good, thanks.

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,005
Ready!

58
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,968
-Time to go.
-Okay.

59
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,678
Thanks, Doc.

60
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:07,308
Haruki, I heard the doc
is researching "Man-eaters,"

61
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,560
and even experimenting on humans.

62
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,770
What?

63
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,772
Robin's investigating at the moment.

64
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,108
But it'd be better if Kiriko
didn't get too close to him.

00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,003

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,721
What's happening?

73
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,224
There's a Man-eater in the third district!

74
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,726
It's not coming this way,
so go back to sleep.

75
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,437
-Let's go, Robin!
-Coming!

76
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:57,983
Are you going?

77
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,320
It's okay, I have the gun that I made,

78
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,281
and I want to be helpful to Robin.

Not bad.

83
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,679
You killed a Man-eater
with that weapon last week?

84
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,305
Yeah.

85
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,768
I'm not playing around!
I told you not to come. It's dangerous!

86
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,312
I made Robin angry, though.

87
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,192
Ten years ago, Robin had a sister my age.

88
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,945
He lost her in the Great Disaster.

89
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,783
Since then, he's been overprotective.

90
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,537
Wait! What time is it?

91
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,791
Which watch is right again?

92
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,711
-That one.
-Twenty after two.

93
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,714
I have to go! Sis's race starts at three!

94
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,798
See you later!

95
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,468
Robin might be overprotective,

96
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,803
but that guy is obsessed with his sister.

Help!

101
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,391
There's a Man-eater
at the end of the track!

102
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,851
It can turn invisible,
same as the one before!

Sis.

106
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,618
<i>The Man-eater's gone into the arcade.</i>

107
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:15,329
<i>It's probably seven or eight minutes</i>
<i>until the karts get there.</i>

108
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,124
<i>I'll drive it away.</i>

109
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,044
<i>I know I can do it.</i>

110
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,507
<i>After the long straight,</i>

111
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,593
<i>karts eight, three and four</i>
<i>round the second corner.</i>

112
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:33,389
<i>It's a crash for two and five,</i>
<i>a spin that will set them way back!</i>

113
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,766
The rest are off towards Sensoji.

114
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,269
<i>Number four, Takehaya,</i>
<i>you pulled that off well!</i>

115
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,271
-Goddamn it!
-Nice one, Kiriko!

116
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:44,942
<i>Where is it?</i>

117
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,194
<i>Has it left the course?</i>

118
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,114
Got it!

119
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,583
<i>Unbelievable, it barely hurt it.</i>

120
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,616
Finally, got a hit.

121
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,206
My arm!

122
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,459
Let me go!

123
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,759

Call the race off!

132
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,618
Go back and tell the headquarters.

133
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:18,703

136
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:52,945

Takehaya has regained consciousness!

154

Apparently,
there's another Man-eater in the area,

I think that
the shock of her brother's death

169
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:07,992
has led her to believe
that she is her brother.

170

00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:44,945
<i>I don't understand.</i>

183
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,366
<i>Last time I saw her,</i>

184
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,661
<i>she was crying, but definitely alive.</i>

185
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:58,626
<i>Was she eaten by the Man-eater?</i>

186
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,587
<i>One thing is undeniable.</i>

187
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,340
<i>I am definitely still Haruki.</i>

188
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:06,509
<i>The proof of that</i>

189
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:11,013
<i>is the sorrow splintering through me</i>
<i>at the news of my sister's death,</i>

190
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,934
<i>and the occasional faint solace</i>

191
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,022
<i>of having inherited</i>
<i>the body of someone I love.</i>

192
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:26,529
<i>By the time my sister's wounds had healed,</i>
<i>and I could start to move her body again,</i>

193
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,532
<i>nearly four months had passed.</i>

194
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,039
<i>Robin must be investigating</i>
<i>what that doctor was up to.</i>

195
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,792
<i>I'm sure he will be able to figure it out.</i>

196
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,628
<i>He'll be able to tell me</i>
<i>why I have become my sister,</i>

197
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,880
<i>and why she had to die.</i>

198
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,132
ASAKUSA RACE ASSOCIATION
HEADQUARTERS

199
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:47,967
Excuse me.

200
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,555
I'm hoping to see Robin Inazaki
from the Asakusa Race Association--

201
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,433
That's not possible.

202
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,812
Sometime around September last year,

203
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,107
I'm pretty sure he was murdered.

204
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,903
<i>There was an increase in disappearances</i>
<i>around here last year.</i>

205
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:11,157
<i>Seems he got tangled up</i>
<i>in trying to investigate.</i>

206
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:15,202
<i>Then, just like that,</i>
<i>he ended up disappearing too.</i>

207
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,292
Ken! Ran!

208
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:22,835
Director!

209
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,795
Anyone!

210
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:34,430
Please! What happened to
the orphanage that was here?

211
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:37,600
-It was moved elsewhere.
-What?

212
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:40,895
Their highest earning racer died…

213
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,396
REPORTS OF SPECTATORS
GOING MISSING

214
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,523
…and the leader went missing.

215
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:49,070
I expect with all the bad luck,
they gave up on this town.

216
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,132
Sis.

217
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:12,718
Robin.

218
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:20,935
<i>Then, just like that,</i>
<i>he ended up disappearing too.</i>

219
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,729
<i>The leader went missing.</i>

220
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:26,774
"Missing"?

221
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,067
"Disappeared"?

222
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,445
There isn't actually any proof
that Robin is dead.

223
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,451
There's no way Robin can be dead.

224
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,538
He must be alive somewhere.

225
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:43,833
The doctor.

226
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,335
The doctor has the answer to everything.

227
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,214
Where Robin is, why my sister is dead

228
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,760
and why I'm living inside her body!

229
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,470
TRIP GUARD

230
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,055
PROTECTION FROM WILD ANIMALS,
BANDITS AND MAN-EATERS - KIRUKO

231
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:02,560
<i>After that, I lived in various towns,</i>
<i>searching for the two of them,</i>

232
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:06,522
<i>accepting requests,</i>
<i>and doing everything by myself.</i>

233
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:13,070
Four years later, I met you in Nakano.

234
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:14,155
DO NOT ENTER

235
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,414
It's the first time I've told anyone that.

236
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,251
I want to check something with you.

237
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:31,589
Would it be better
if I stopped calling you "Sis"?

238
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:32,923
That?

239
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,592
Don't worry about it.

240
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:38,304
You've been calling me that for a month,
pretty sure we're both used to it now.

241
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:43,184
Well, there you go.
You'll have to think of me as a man now.

242
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,644
I can't wrap my mind around it
just like that!

243
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,860
Anyway,
you're getting pretty good looking.

244
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,112
I'm sure you'll meet someone
more appropriate soon.

245
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:58,491
I won't find a girl
I get along with this well.

246
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,993
That's because we're both guys.

247
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:05,539
So the photo of Jane Inamura, right?

248
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:06,999
It's Robin Inazaki.

249
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,211
What do you think about him?

250
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,589
Well,

251
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:17,468
we grew up in the same house,
so I guess he's like family.

252
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,512
But he's also a close friend.

253
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:22,014
I suppose I admire him.

254
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,060
Because we're both guys! I look up to him.

255
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,937
You still don't get it, do you?

256
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,315
What do you expect
when you tell someone something like that?

257
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:35,236
Maybe a good night's sleep
will sort your head out.

258
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:36,987
Fine.

259
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:39,824
Maybe when I wake up
this will all turn out to be a dream.

260
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,786
What now? What's the racket for?

261
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,163
What is it?

262
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,958
There was a huge fish outside the window.

263
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,042
A fish?

264
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:56,257
The window is wet,
even though it's not raining.

265
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:57,842
Strange.

266
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,804
Maru, go and tell the captain
to keep an eye--

267
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:12,440
A Man-eater.

268
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,291
Is it a baby?

269
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,711
Can I have it?

270
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,756
I promised to give this one to Tokio.
You can have the next.

271
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,258
Sounds good to me!

272
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,301
I like your weird drawing.

273
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:05,886
You think it's weird?

274
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,265
Obviously! Proper babies--

275
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,352
<i>Climbing on tables is forbidden, Kuku.</i>

276
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:16,355
Stop annoying Kona and come with me.

277
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,523
Hey--

278
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:24,613
If you're going to be nasty about them,
then stop asking for Kona's drawings!

279
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,240
I was saying they were good!

280
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:29,910
Besides, I've seen one. A real baby.

281
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:34,623
Real babies don't have faces.

282
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,627
<i>Want to go and see it?</i>
