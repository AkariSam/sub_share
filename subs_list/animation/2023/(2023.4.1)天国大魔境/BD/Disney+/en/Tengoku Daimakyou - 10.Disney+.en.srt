1
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,086
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,588
{\an8}How far is it to Ibaraki and Nara?

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:05,965
{\an8}Far enough.

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,926
{\an8}But Ibaraki is closer than Nara.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,679
THE WALLED TOWN

6
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:16,142
{\an8}Nara, Bakinara, Bakinara, Ibaraki.

7
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,227
{\an8}Nara, Ibaraki, Nara, Ibaraki.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,603
{\an8}Nara, Baraki, Baraki.

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,480
Nara, Kibara, Nara, Ibaraki, Nara--

10
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:23,858
Shut up with the "narabaki, narabaki!"

11
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,570
{\an8}But five hours is so long.

12
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,613
What are you? A kid?

13
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,699
Can't we get there faster?

14
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:36,245
{\an8}Well, it might take
longer than five hours.

15
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,663
{\an8}-What?
-What?

16
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:40,291
{\an8}Well, the earthquake made the roads…

17
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,877
{\an8}Then, how long is it gonna take?

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,170
{\an8}I'm not sure.

19
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,088
{\an8}That's weird.

20
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,760
You're not taking us to your friends
to get back at us, are you?

21
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,762
{\an8}I'd never do that.

22
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:54,930
{\an8}Didn't you mean what you said earlier?

23
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,015
{\an8}ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO

24
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,225
{\an8}You scared me!

25
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,643
What do you mean?

26
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,022
You said you wanted to see
if the baby is still alive.

27
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,859
The story about the breeding pig is true.

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,529
I was going to take revenge
once I got everything ready.

29
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,907
Is that why you wanted my gun?

30
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,243
Sis, this tattoo is the real thing.

31
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,045
<i>Let me ask you one thing. Where is it?</i>

32
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,298
On roads that are
in good condition, about five hours.

33
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,050
It's around here.

34
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,302
<i>Isn't it practically in Ibaraki?</i>

35
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:36,555
<i>Isn't that what you call "perfect pitch"?</i>

36
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,642
<i>It's "timing."</i>

37
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,042
I didn't steal it.

38
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,881
I-- I'm sorry.

39
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,008
Are you okay?

40
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:18,848
But does this mean you'll trust me now?

41
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:23,936
Juichi.

42
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm still only coming with you
to see if the baby's alive.

43
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,821
That's good enough.

44
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,873
Let's hide the car here and go. Then--

45
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,916
Hey, don't stand out so much!

46
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,254
Miss, wait a minute!

47
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,590
There's something I need to check.

48
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,847
You jerk!

49
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,726
Don't feel up the chest
of another man's woman!

50
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,436
I-- I'm sorry!

51
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,730
Who is whose woman?

52
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,565
I-- I'm sorry.

53
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,860
That's not it. I didn't notice yesterday,

54
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,197
but your large chest
could put you in danger.

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,281
Why?

56
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:23,245
Women with big chests
are hated in that town.

57
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,456
Please keep your jacket zipped up.

58
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,833
Some had to cut theirs off to live there.

59
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:28,918
SELF-IMPOSED RESTRAINT

60
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,545
Why would women do that to each other?

61
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,299
They're a crazy bunch that imprisoned
a young boy and tattooed him!

62
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,052
Who knows what they're thinking?

63
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,013
Now I'm worried. I'm going with you!

64
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,933
You idiot! It's even more dangerous
to go with a man!

65
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,228
If you want to go,
I've got something good.

66
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,315
-Maybe a little to the left?
-Oh, you're right.

67
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,238
How does it look?

68
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,077
W-- What the… You're p-- pretty.

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,995
Why don't you look happy?

70
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:07,832
Hey, Juichi!

71
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,333
Who's prettier?

72
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,795
What? Naturally, you, miss.

73
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,672
S-- Since you're a woman.

74
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,217
Okay! Should we go now?

75
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,427
What's with her?

76
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,220
This is, you know--

77
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,304
Shut up.

78
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,350
It's this way.

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,109
You'll see the school building
right in front.

80
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,696
You know, if we can see it from here,
then they can see--

81
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,448
I got it. I got it.

82
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,616
We'll be back.

83
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,910
Don't mess with our stuff!

84
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,788
I won't touch it.

85
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,418
There are people who would, though.

86
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,879
That girl, right? The King of Hotels?

87
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,173
I wonder how she's doing.

88
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,508
I hope she's good.

89
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,598
That's one giant hole
for a place called the Walled Town.

90
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,975
Right, coming in.

91
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,769
Wait for me, Sis.

92
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:18,652
It's not just abandoned, it's wrecked.

93
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,823
It's already…

94
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,116
Yeah.

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,494
It looks like people already lived here.

96
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,748
Since it's such a mess,
they must have moved out, right?

97
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,000
Then what about the breeding pigs?

98
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,087
Let's look around some more.

99
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,341
Is anyone here?

100
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,974
You never watch where you're going.

101
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,019
I was trying to be careful.

102
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,855
This sleeping bag is nice.

103
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,320
Isn't it like they just disappeared?
Leaving their things like this?

104
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:03,739
So that's it.

105
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,158
Maru, this journal is incomplete.

106
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:07,910
Incomplete?

107
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,287
The journal stops with only a date
on this page.

108
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,872
This…

109
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,543
What the--

110
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,877
It got so cold…

111
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,051
Ouch. What was that for--

112
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,304
Sis?

113
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,518
Sis! The water!

114
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,686
The room!

115
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,022
Damn.

116
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,440
Maru.

117
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,858
It's a Man-eater.

118
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,193
It's gotta be close.

119
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,278
Find it.

120
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:46,782
My eyes

121
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,117
are sticking shut.

122
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,085
Above us! Sis!

123
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,639
So it was a Hiruko.

124
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,352
Damn it.

125
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,020
That was really bad.

126
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,564
A second longer and it would've killed us.

127
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,984
How did you know it was up there?

128
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,486
Just somehow.

129
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,862
Somehow?

130
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,659
Let's run for it.

131
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,413
It's following us from above!

132
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,332
Better not bump into it on the stairs!

133
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:42,004
What are you doing? Come on!

134
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,924
Sis?

135
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,677
Weren't we running away?

136
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,497
<i>It's doing it.</i>

137
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,893
<i>I get it now.</i>

138
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,271
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

139
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,982
<i>It's that kind of attack.</i>

140
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:46,193
<i>No need to be scared now. I understand it.</i>

141
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,573
<i>You get the upper hand when you</i>
<i>surprise and freeze them in a small space,</i>

142
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,410
<i>but when someone runs at you</i>
<i>with a weapon before they freeze,</i>

143
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,578
<i>you're in trouble!</i>

144
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,507
It's not here.

145
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:12,303
I can get in, but I can't find the core.

146
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,389
Half of it ran away.
So that was its main body.

147
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,141
What should we do?

148
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:22,813
You're leaving?

149
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,815
Hey, Sis.

150
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:28,652
This town is completely gone, Maru.

151
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,449
We were only asked to confirm his safety.

152
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,259
Like I can say it.

153
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,345
Then I'll tell him.

154
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,013
That's fine, right?

155
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,266
There was no one there?

156
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,810
No women either?

157
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,853
And there was a Hiruko.

158
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,605
A Man-eater was living there.

159
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,067
So aside from the child,

160
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,696
even those I hated weren't there.

161
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,367
A Man-eater turned it into a nest.

162
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,077
So it just means no one is living there.

163
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,580
The Man-eater could have
started living there

164
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,250
after everyone moved,
when the building got too old.

165
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:30,423
Juichi, you can't lose hope.

166
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,929
Hey! You three slant eyes!

167
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,017
Who's calling us weird names?

168
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,394
-Is it him?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

169
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,979
It can't be--

170
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,147
Look, see!

171
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,482
Aren't you Boar #11?

172
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,859
You're alive!

173
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,572
Boar #6! And Boar #9!

174
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,365
Don't call us that!

175
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,660
You're the one who said it first!
I just copied you!

176
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:02,913
So, we're living somewhere else now.

177
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,750
The kid born from your seed is healthy!

178
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,462
-What?
-Anyways, come see!

179
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,589
…and that's what happened.

180
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,843
Was it about a month?

181
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,220
It was a month after you ran away,

182
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,431
and those two women had been executed.

183
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,225
Your son started crying
in the middle of the night.

184
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,229
<i>Who knows what those women</i>
<i>would do if it annoyed them?</i>

185
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:28,981
<i>So we all tried to quiet him.</i>

186
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,317
<i>That's when</i>

187
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,445
<i>the monster invaded.</i>

188
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,740
Because we were awake,

189
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,910
we were able to escape
through the hole the monster created.

190
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,791
Look, Jugo! It's your dad!

191
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,251
Not me. That way, Jugo.

192
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,130
I said it's not me.

193
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:54,715
He won't understand.

194
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,025
Good for him.

195
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,653
His enemies are all dead
and his kid is okay.

196
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,113
Isn't it great?

197
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,116
Now I won't feel bad taking his money.

198
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,953
Why are you lying like that,

199
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,830
when you're clearly crying?

200
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,997
Shut up.

201
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,712
Hey, what else do we have?

202
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:36,632
Boar meat, deer, mouse and a small bird.

203
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:38,217
Let's just cook it all!

204
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,969
Is it a big mouse? Small?

205
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,679
-The small kind.
-Did you kill it?

206
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,931
-No way!
-Can I have a drink?

207
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,851
-I want to cook that smoked meat I made.
-That sounds good.

208
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,103
-It was so tasty.
-Alcohol is--

209
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,187
Juichi.

210
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:53,816
Eat. It's your welcome party.

211
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,697
I want to thank you for Jugo.

212
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,491
They said you were taking care of him.

213
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,244
Of course. He's your son.

214
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,040
You know, Juichi--

215
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,213
So stupid. Stu-- stupid.

216
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:23,387
After freezing today,
thank goodness for this.

217
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,736
I'm so sleepy after that hot bath
and eating my fill of meat.

218
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,488
What are we doing tomorrow?

219
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,616
Let's go find that Ibaraki facility.

220
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,159
How are we gonna find it?

221
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,370
I've got an idea…

222
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,041
She fell asleep while talking.

223
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,713
Lights out.

224
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,903
Wake up, Maru!

225
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,406
Sis, this is…

226
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,865
There's no mistaking it.

227
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,617
Everyone get outside!

228
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,537
This cold is an attack by a Man-eater!

229
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,456
Where's Juichi?

230
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,541
He's not here?

231
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,418
Juichi isn't here!

232
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,378
Calm down! You sure?

233
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,256
The leader and Jugo aren't here either!

234
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:44,802
Damn it! Where are you, Juichi?
Get outside now!

235
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,471
Juichi.

236
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,348
He's just unconscious.

237
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:51,017
Here, take Jugo.

238
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,438
Everyone! Get on the road and run around!

239
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,566
If you don't keep moving,
you'll die in a minute!

240
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:02,653
<i>Stay calm.</i>

241
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,614
<i>My head's so cold, it hurts!</i>

242
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,116
<i>I can still feel my legs.</i>

243
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,204
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

244
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:15,750
<i>I can't get away from the cold</i>
<i>no matter how much I run.</i>

245
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,377
<i>My lungs are freezing.</i>

246
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,838
<i>Is it chasing me?</i>

247
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,674
<i>Then why can't I see it?</i>

248
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,676
<i>Or hear its footsteps?</i>

249
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,970
<i>Damn it!</i>

250
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,515
<i>The attack range I figured out earlier…</i>

251
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:34,935
<i>Did I get it wrong?</i>

252
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,151
Sis!

253
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:50,785
<i>The cold air is gone.</i>

254
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,665
You're good now! Sis!

255
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,378
-Don't go near him!
-Let me go!

256
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:03,172
The baby's gonna die!
Are you gonna let him die?

257
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,591
No! That kid's the Hiruko!

258
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,470
I know now since I've fought
them a few times.

259
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,224
I can sense a Hiruko's presence.

260
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:18,270
Sis. That kid is the one
doing this cold attack.

261
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,344
The cold is gone now.

262
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:52,096
Like nothing happened.

263
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:57,768
Okay, it's okay.

264
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:05,443
They said they can remove
the thing inside me soon.

265
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,904
After that I can go back…

266
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,657
…to school.

267
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:15,411
And I can see you, Kona.

268
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,668
I want to see you soon, Kona.

269
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:35,639
<i>It'll be born soon.</i>

270
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:40,561
Dr. Sawatari!

271
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,522
It'll be fine.

272
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,901
Jugo!

273
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,444
And this too.

274
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,407
It expired ten years ago,
but it's better than nothing.

275
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,034
Thanks.

276
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:58,496
Is it really okay to take it?

277
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,873
We have more of the same medicine.

278
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,250
Not that.

279
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,127
The car.

280
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,509
I don't have a reason to travel anymore.

281
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:17,306
Besides, the car here
is much better than mine.

282
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:22,687
Yeah. You're right.

283
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:27,983
See ya, Juichi.

284
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,654
Careful you don't get frozen to death
by your son!

285
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,255
What? Crap. That's weird.

286
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,758
-Sis?
-I know!

287
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,343
Let's go. Come on!

288
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,638
No!

289
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,682
What do you mean "no"?

290
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,975
Shut up, Maru!

291
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,351
Panicking won't make it work!

292
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:04,020
Ah, geez!

293
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:11,986
Everyone, we will be welcoming
your new friends.

294
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,199
This will be a very important
time for you.

295
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,326
Aim for the right future,

296
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,911
no matter what happens.

297
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,415
Listen to your heart if you are confused.

298
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,209
What a vague speech.

299
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:31,964
Now please say hello to the new 5th years.

300
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:59,116
<i>That night.</i>

301
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,286
<i>The night I escaped.</i>

302
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:19,553
Someone broke out!

303
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:25,685
Someone's escaped!

304
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:31,023
<i>Someone shouted out immediately.</i>

305
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,944
<i>Was I the traitor for escaping?</i>

306
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:39,407
<i>Is it a grudge?</i>

307
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:42,451
<i>I don't even know anymore.</i>

308
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,579
<i>But I do know one thing.</i>

309
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,916
<i>The one who killed Jugo's mother was--</i>

310
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,101
<i>Well,</i>

311
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,353
<i>until next time.</i>

312
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,408
What was that?

313
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:25,911
What? What? Inside the house?

314
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,289
I got it. I'm coming.

315
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,299
Watch it, you damn idiot!

316
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:41,385
Hey, isn't that our car?
