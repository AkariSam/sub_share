1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,432
Tarao! Want a tomato?

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,766
Thank you.

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,571
Mimihime.

4
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,866
What are you daydreaming for?

5
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,659
Class is about to start.

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,330
We have a test today.

7
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,000
What? Today's just a normal class, right?

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,668
But, we do have one.

9
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,670
<i>Get ready for the test.</i>

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,839
-Huh?
-You never said.

11
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,259
Teacher! I haven't studied at all.
It's impossible.

12
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,970
Even if you had, it'd be impossible.

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,305
What?

14
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,098
<i>Everyone, please be quiet.</i>

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,893
<i>If you paid attention in class,</i>
<i>you'll be fine.</i>

16
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>There are ten questions.</i>

17
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,695
Why does the fish have arms?

18
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,616
Well, to catch other fish of course.

19
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,950
Have you seen one before?

20
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,370
No, I just made it up!

21
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,621
Okay.

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,998
It's weird.

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,083
Strange, right?

24
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,253
Yeah, but I want to show the Director.
It's funny!

25
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,172
Can I have it?

26
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,675
-When I've finished it, okay?
-Okay.

27
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,386
<i>Fifteen minutes left.</i>

28
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,680
Geez! Come on.

29
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,065
{\an8}DO YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE
OF THE OUTSIDE?

30
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,027
Outside of…

31
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,779
the outside?

32
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:10,630
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

33
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,188
So, shall we go hunting for treasure?

34
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,774
Sure, okay.

35
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,527
This neighborhood
doesn't seem too messed up.

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,572
We need to find houses
that haven't been broken into.

37
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,407
Let's go further in then.

38
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,245
It's locked. That's a good sign.

39
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,624
Wait, Maru? Where are you? Hey, Maru!

40
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,961
Sis! We can get in from over here!

41
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,256
The windows are barely broken.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,883
I guess no one's been in here yet.

43
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,806
Oh, it's a total wreck.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,435
I'll go and check the other rooms.

45
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,732
Oh, got a toothbrush.

46
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,442
Sis!

47
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,819
I found an unopened pack of toilet paper!

48
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,822
Nice one. I'm dying!

49
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,742
Oh, no!

50
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,249
Having a toilet makes all the difference,
even if it doesn't work.

51
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,543
Hey, don't look!

52
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,045
Well, shut the door then.

53
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,047
There is no door.

54
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,262
As if, the roof is wide open.

55
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,723
That's why this place is a dump.

56
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,101
I'm so hungry.

57
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,686
Don't say it.

58
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,438
I'm trying not to think about it.

59
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,400
What is it--

60
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,789
Most of the people who survived
ended up dying of starvation.

61
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,583
Since they died in this house,

62
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,378
it means there's no food here.

63
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,172
Let's go to the next house.

64
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
Okay.

65
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,597
Sis, this house is amazing.

66
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,058
It's so glamorous.

67
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,519
Yeah, the people who lived here
must have been super rich.

68
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,603
NAESHIRO FAMILY

69
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,940
Wow, you finally opened the canned food?

70
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,110
Well, we didn't exactly
find anything to eat, did we?

71
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,780
Maru, can you find us
some plates or something?

72
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,450
On it. I'm starved.

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,288
Hey, what's this veg stuff?

74
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,292
The weeds growing all over the place
around here. I think they're edible.

75
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,045
I thought it might fill us up a bit more.

76
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,304
-It's so bitter.
-Spit it out!

77
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,642
It stunk out the whole dish.

78
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,852
I'm sorry!

79
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,188
That was our precious canned food!

80
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,315
I said I'm sorry!

81
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,664
Is that your boyfriend?

82
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,333
You're awake?

83
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,627
I can never fall asleep.

84
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,421
You're always fast asleep way before me.

85
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,300
Really?
I guess I'm a useless bodyguard then.

86
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,220
I'm fine protecting myself.

87
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,263
You can go back if you want.

88
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,186
One is my friend, and the other
is someone I want to see.

89
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,440
If I can find them
while I take you to your destination,

90
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,275
that'll be two birds with one stone.

91
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,278
That's why it's important
I tag along with you.

92
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,990
Anyway, I'm not gonna go anywhere
while you're sleeping,

93
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,617
so you can relax.

94
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,970
HASSOU INN

95
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,692
So, where shall we go today?

96
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,070
We don't have enough info to go on.

97
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,281
I'm sick of wandering around aimlessly.

98
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,367
Well then, let's start looking for others.

99
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,494
Let's go somewhere that might be busy.

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,914
A place where people gather,

101
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,877
like somewhere with land,
or near a station.

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,587
Yeah, somewhere like that.

103
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,924
For now,
let's walk alongside this railway track.

104
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,802
Great! And I want a new pair of shoes.

105
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,930
Okay, okay.
Let's keep an eye out for a store.

106
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,767
And after that,
I'm desperate for some tasty food!

107
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,645
Are you still annoyed at me
for yesterday, or what?

108
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,233
That's not what I meant!

109
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,277
Guys like you

110
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,906
are always saying stupid stuff like that,
even if it is by mistake.

111
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,913
Women!

112
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,332
Just when I thought life
wasn't worth living.

113
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,625
Two women appear.

114
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,002
I'm a man.

115
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,880
Great, a little brat boy.

116
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,465
I'm a boy too.

117
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,633
I'm not stupid!

118
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,178
All right, put down your heavy bags.

119
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,263
I'm gonna take you to heaven.

120
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,393
Just when I thought we'd found someone

121
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,019
it's just a couple of bums.

122
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,690
Whoa, wait. We don't have many bullets.
Don't waste them.

123
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,859
Get outta here if you want to live!

124
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,821
So our lives are worth less than bullets.

125
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:12,575
They're from the lawless generation, whose
world ended before it had even begun.

126
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,537
Who knows what they're capable of.
Let's go.

127
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,165
Not like you could hit us anyway, fools!

128
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,291
Damn.

129
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,713
Wait a sec. Is that even a real gun?

130
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,594
What's this, what's this?
Dropping it now, are we?

131
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,639
I've never seen a gun that weird before.

132
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,017
You're just bluffing
with some kid's plaything.

133
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,521
Run!

134
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,817
There's no escape!
I won't let you make us look like idiots!

135
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,926
It shoots…

136
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:25,273
So, you were saying something
about taking me to heaven?

137
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,025
That was, I--

138
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,112
We're looking for it. Heaven.

139
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,864
Take us there.

140
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,991
MORIYAMA HOSPITAL

141
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,661
Wow, what a flashy home you guys have.

142
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,123
What do you think, Maru?
Anything catch your attention?

143
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,168
No, nothing.

144
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,003
Right?

145
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,506
There's no way this is the goal.
It'd be a miracle.

146
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,927
Oh, there's a generator!
That's a generator, right?

147
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,388
Can you charge my battery?

148
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,264
Why would I do that?

149
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,185
I don't think you're really grasping
the full reality of your situation.

150
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,022
You attacked us,
but we turned the tables on you.

151
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,567
Even if I decide to kill you,
you don't have the right to complain.

152
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,280
We'll leave once the battery is full.

153
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,116
Please.

154
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:26,418
And while we're at it, you guys
heard of a place called "Heaven"?

155
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,170
At this point, anywhere
with "heaven" in its name,

156
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,298
or even a place you think
feels "just like heaven" will do.

157
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,386
As if anything like heaven exists
since the Collapse.

158
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,805
I understand that.

159
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,099
That's why I tried to
make the question simpler for you.

160
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,019
Do you guys like tomatoes?

161
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,687
They're back.

162
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,939
Why? Gonna give us some?

163
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,611
If you do, then I've heard of something
you might call "heaven."

164
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,698
-Maru, don't you like tomatoes?
-Love them.

165
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,783
Tell us the details.

166
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,580
Here.

167
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,999
Oh, thank you so much!

168
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,668
What kind of battery is that exactly?

169
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,713
My gun battery.

170
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,506
You little brat!

171
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,677
You've been controlling us with a gun
that doesn't work this whole time.

172
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,182
I wasn't even sure that last shot
was gonna fire. I was out of bullets.

173
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,100
Right, Maru?

174
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,104
Morons! I hope you die by the roadside.
Lawless youths!

175
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,647
You should respect your elders!

176
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,282
Phew, that was close.

177
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,285
It was no big deal.
Just a bunch of old idiots.

178
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,954
We got this charged up too!

179
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,832
I feel so much better
now we've got four shots.

180
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,877
It's probably better not to
count it as four shots.

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,962
The number of times
that thing doesn't work…

182
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,633
Well anyway, off to "Tomato Heaven."

183
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,429
<i>What the hell is "Tomato Heaven"?</i>

184
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,559
I'm not really sure
that's the best way to hold an exam.

185
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,605
Mimihime, how did you know there
was going to be a test?

186
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,942
I don't know. I just had a hunch somehow.

187
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,445
But there is one thing that is certain.

188
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:24,703
Just because you know there's a test,
there's no promise of full marks.

189
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,375
Class is done! Let's play some sport.

190
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,878
I want to continue working on this, so…

191
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,339
Then, Anzu?

192
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,465
No thanks.

193
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,552
There's no way I can win against you.

194
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,470
Tokio?

195
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,348
Tokio has something
to discuss with me. Right?

196
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,814
Fine then.
I guess I'll get Kona to play with me.

197
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,031
Where on earth
does he get reflexes like that?

198
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,157
Kona!

199
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,290
You said something about
the outside during the test, didn't you?

200
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,043
No, that was…

201
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,714
What do you think
the outside is like, Tokio?

202
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:19,966
Outside?

203
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,428
Why would you ask--

204
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,557
Not here. Outside this wall.

205
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,643
Huh? There's an outside beyond the wall?

206
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,812
Isn't it just nothing?

207
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,314
I think there is something else.

208
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,734
I've always had a feeling that there is.

209
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,738
And recently,
I've been able to imagine it more clearly.

210
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,911
<i>When I think about wanting to go outside,</i>

211
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:52,082
<i>two people from the outside come</i>
<i>to help me, and one of their faces…</i>

212
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,333
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE
OF THE OUTSIDE?

213
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,087
<i>…is exactly the same as yours.</i>

214
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,763
<i>Outside the room…</i>

215
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,766
<i>outside the school…</i>

216
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,228
outside of…

217
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:14,854
the outside.

218
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,149
Tokio?

219
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,236
Director.

220
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,406
If you can't sleep,
do you want some medicine?

221
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,157
No, I…

222
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,662
Is there an outside beyond this one?

223
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,041
Did you think of that yourself?

224
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,292
Mimihime did.

225
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,171
That girl has a sharp intuition.

226
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,464
Director.

227
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,801
It's only a matter of time
before they find out. Don't worry.

228
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,053
Tokio?

229
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,891
There is an outside beyond here.

230
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,020
Hey, Maru,

231
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,774
it may surprise you to hear this,
coming from your bodyguard--

232
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,611
I'm pretty sure nothing you say
could surprise me anymore.

233
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,574
I can't walk any further.

234
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,825
What?

235
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,786
What? We've been sleeping outdoors,
traversing mountains.

236
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,204
I've reached my limit.

237
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,292
There's nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep.
I can't go on.

238
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:22,839
All that talk of there being shops
on every corner before the Collapse…

239
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,758
Was it all a lie?

240
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,719
It's just because
we are on a path between cities.

241
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,512
You're a city girl, aren't you?

242
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,474
Exactly.
I'm a Tokyo girl through and through.

243
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,850
Ouch.

244
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,686
Let's at least find
a decent spot to sleep.

245
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:41,149
Where do you get so much energy from?
Is it because you're young?

246
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,026
We're basically the same age.

247
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,320
You're 15, right?

248
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,447
I think so. You?

249
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,451
I'm 18, wait, 20.

250
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,661
What's with the two-year gap?

251
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,747
I'm not good with numbers, okay?

252
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,211
No way.

253
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,674
That place is open?

254
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,384
We are, yes.

255
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,514
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

256
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,391
All right, that'll do.

257
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,560
Are you sure it's enough? It's so cheap.

258
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,772
I feel bad. Take these too.

259
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,569
Wow, AA batteries! Thank you!

260
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,823
Can I look at the guest book?

261
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,241
Go for it.

262
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,369
You can't get batteries like this anymore!

263
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,621
And in a place like this!

264
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,290
He's not in here.

265
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,253
Have you ever seen these two here?

266
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,673
He's good-looking. If I had, I'd remember.

267
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,299
What are their names?

268
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,926
Robin Inazaki.

269
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,513
Well, I really don't know.

270
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,307
What about the older, punky-looking one?

271
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,978
I don't know his name.

272
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,857
Everyone called him "Doc" or "Sir."

273
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,650
I see.

274
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:10,989
Oh, before I forget, have you ever heard
of a place called "Heaven"?

275
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,327
Well, that's how
everyone describes this place.

276
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,498
It's heaven!

277
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,976
Kiruko.

278
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,187
Y-yes.

279
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,398
The mirror.

280
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,069
That's a huge crack in the mirror!
I was just looking at it.

281
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,532
The shower doesn't work,
but you can use the hot bath water.

282
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,537
There are plenty of bottles,
but just use what you need.

283
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,374
The one that foams nicely is the shampoo.

284
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,345
We don't have power reserves here,
you need to use that while the sun is up.

285
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,513
Got it.

286
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,981
Excuse me,

287
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,527
that case, is it a gun case?

288
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,280
Uh-huh. There's a monster
that prowls around this area.

289
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,491
Don't go out wandering at night.

290
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,910
-Monster…
-Hiruko.

291
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,453
You mean a "Man-eater"?

292
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,500
People call it different things,

293
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,587
but it's this big, confusing shape,

294
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,297
and it eats people.

295
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,968
We can kill it.

296
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,057
That's-- Guns have no effect on it.

297
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,225
We'll do it.

298
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,894
My Kiru-Beam works on it, and this kid--

299
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,062
Kiru-Beams?

300
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,230
What?

301
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,606
Kiru-Beam…

302
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,735
Just because it's your beam,
you named it after yourself?

303
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,987
Why do you need the details?

304
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,156
You already think it's weird anyway.

305
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,491
Exactly, it's weird.
That's why I'm asking.

306
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:26,082
I've made a stew with some kind of
boar meat and vegetables, if you like?

307
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,461
Really, we can have some?

308
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,592
It's really good!

309
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,096
I wanted to discuss
something with you both.

310
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,182
Well, it's a bit tricky to find the words.

311
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:47,729
Even though you two were raised
in these strange times,

312
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,774
you use chopsticks perfectly,
and seem to have been educated well.

313
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,069
I may be meddling,
but I have to say something.

314
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,615
It's not my opinion,
or a rule or anything,

315
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,618
but having children with a close relative,

316
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,414
genetically speaking,
is fundamentally dangerous!

317
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,209
What are you trying to say?

318
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:14,005
He might keep calling me "Sis,"

319
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,257
but we are not even slightly related!

320
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,011
And more to the point,
we are not even dating!

321
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,017
I got completely the wrong idea!

322
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,019
Give me a break!

323
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,940
I do all kinds of stuff in Tokyo,

324
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,150
I'm sorta like an odd-job girl.

325
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,779
I received a request to be
this guy's bodyguard during his travels.

326
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,616
He is nothing to me
beyond an object of my protection.

327
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:51,001
What's wrong, Maru?
Why are you suddenly so down?

328
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,753
Why are you dragging your futon
so far away?

329
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,008
Hey, are you mad about something?

330
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,055
Geez.

331
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,017
So today you fall asleep straightaway…

332
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,897
May as well go to sleep too then.

333
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,528
Wow.

334
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,365
Am I really that tired?

335
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,701
Something…

336
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,203
feels strange…

337
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,198
<i>Is there an outside beyond this one?</i>

338
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,618
There is an outside beyond here.

339
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,832
However, it is a filthy world, a hell…

340
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,670
where abhorrent monsters lurk.

341
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,007
HEAVEN AND HELL
