<i>This story is a work of fiction.</i>

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,677
<i>Or rather, everything in this world</i>
<i>is mostly fictional.</i>

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,138
<i>It's made up…</i>

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,098
<i>and exaggerated.</i>

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>They hide whatever is an inconvenience.</i>

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:25,191
<i>If that's the case, fans of idols would</i>
<i>prefer that they made up good lies.</i>

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,904
<i>In this world, lies are a weapon.</i>

8
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,866
Ai!

9
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,327
I wish I could've seen
this cuteness in person!

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,003
Idol group B Komachi's permanent ace
and irreplaceable center role,

11
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,631
the ultimate 16-year-old beauty, Ai!

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,634
Four years since they formed!

13
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,013
The group has slowly gained popularity
and media coverage,

14
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,807
and they've finally caught
the public's eye!

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,853
It starts here!
This is where her path to stardom…

16
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,399
Why are you in a patient's hospital room,
playing an idol's DVD?

17
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,735
Haven't you got any common sense?

18
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,531
Observing beauty is good for your health.

19
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,118
<i>Since no idol concerts are held</i>
<i>in the countryside here.</i>

20
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,245
<i>It's part of medical practice.</i>

21
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,498
<i>You're recruiting cult followers.</i>

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,501
<i>Don't make that</i>
<i>our hospital's official views.</i>

23
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:29,506
Oh, speaking of which, Doctor.
It trending on Twitter earlier…

24
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,508
<i>What?!</i>

25
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,719
Ai's going on hiatus?!

26
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,931
So you really are a cult fan.

27
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,768
Isn't that girl only 16? You lolicon.

28
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,645
Call me anything but that.

29
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,106
There's a reason for it, a good reason.

30
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,402
<i>I also did my internship at this hospital.</i>

31
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,740
<i>Back then, I used to slack off</i>
<i>in patients' rooms just like now.</i>

32
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,075
<i>Get to work.</i>

33
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:02,288
<i>One of the patients I met at that time</i>
<i>changed my destiny.</i>

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,334
And this is Mei-Mei! Her dancing is good!

35
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,752
Hm.

36
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,464
Ari-pyan and Kyun-pan
are better at singing.

37
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,217
But my favorite…

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,553
has got to be Ai!

39
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:22,016
We're about the same age, but she's
so mature and good at singing and dancing!

40
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,435
Above all, I love her face.

41
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,896
If I could be reborn, I want this face.

42
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,110
What do you mean reborn?
Don't say such stupid stuff.

43
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,821
You need to dream more, Doctor.

44
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:42,287
Haven't you ever thought, "What if I was
born as the child of a celebrity?"

45
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:48,042
What if you had the looks and connections
since the time you were born?

46
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,669
Nope.

47
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,963
You really don't dream enough.

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,382
Sarina, you're cute too.

49
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,676
There's no need to be reborn.

50
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,432
Once you're discharged, go become an idol.

51
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,183
Then I'll be your fan.

52
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,101
Really?

53
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,395
Doctor, I love you! Marry me!

54
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,565
Give me a break,
that'll be social suicide.

55
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,901
You moralist.

56
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:17,196
Too bad. I'll think about it seriously
once you become 16.

57
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,658
Sixteen, huh?

58
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,412
Doctor, you're mean.

59
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,372
It's a realistic plan.

60
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,049
<i>Anaplastic astrocytoma.</i>

61
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,842
<i>She was only 12 years old.</i>

62
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,097
If she were still alive,
she'd be 16, just like Ai.

63
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,977
I must be seeing Sarina
in the idol that she liked.

64
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,942
I just want to watch over Ai as she walks
the path that Sarina dreamed of walking.

65
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,735
I see.

66
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,737
So basically, you're a lolicon.

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,116
Were you listening?
Wasn't that a pretty touching story?!

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,287
Doctor, your obsession
with her feels crude.

69
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,208
Aren't you using Sarina
as an excuse to unleash your desires?

70
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,587
Don't be stupid. I swear on her name,
I'm supporting Ai with a pure heart!

71
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,842
But if that Ai girl asked you out,
you would go out with her, wouldn't you?

72
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,183
Lunch break's over now.
I'm going back to work.

73
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,980
Well, Doctor? Swearing on
Sarina's name, what's the answer?

74
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>But I'm worried about Ai.</i>
<i>I hope she comes back safely.</i>

75
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,280
OB-GYN

76
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,074
Hi, thanks for waiting.

77
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,162
Um, so this is your first visit here,
Hoshino.

78
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,080
Yes.

79
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,209
<i>Based on her belly,</i>
<i>she's at about 20 weeks.</i>

80
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,296
<i>Pretty late for a first examination.</i>

81
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,883
<i>She's 16. I see, so that's why.</i>

82
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,262
<i>One of those ones who came this far,</i>
<i>being unable to consult anybody.</i>

83
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,306
Are you her parent?

84
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,391
Well, on paper.

85
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,309
Huh?

86
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,894
She was raised in a children's home,

87
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,940
so I'm actually like her legal guardian
or guarantor.

88
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:16,858
I see.

89
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,403
<i>Sixteen and raised in a children's home.</i>

90
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,989
<i>This story sounds familiar…</i>

91
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>It's just like…</i>

92
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,127
Doctor, what do you think?

93
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,464
Isn't there a chance
that she's just extremely constipated?

94
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,924
If she were, she'd be dead.

95
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,178
Everything's fine on that end.
No problems today either!

96
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,518
Let's do some tests first.
Please wait while we get prepared.

97
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,104
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

98
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait…</i>
<i>Huh?! Is she the real deal?!</i>

99
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,610
<i>Is she Ai's look-alike?!</i>

100
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,030
<i>No, being a longtime fan,</i>
<i>I could never mistake her!</i>

101
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,993
<i>Wow! Ai is super cute in person!</i>

102
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,369
<i>Not now!</i>

103
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>My favorite idol is pregnant!</i>

104
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,211
<i>I'm about to vomit from the shock.</i>

105
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,170
Ai.

106
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,839
Seriously, how did this happen?

107
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,758
<i>Like, seriously!</i>

108
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,552
Why didn't you at least consult me,
the CEO?

109
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,013
Who's the father?

110
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,556
That's…

111
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,312
a secret!

112
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:40,274
<i>A secret, eh?!</i>
<i>Then I can't do much about that!</i>

113
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,204
Based on the results,
you're 20 weeks pregnant with twins.

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,164
-Twins.
-Twins.

115
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,084
Twins…

116
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,628
Ai, are you serious about having them?

117
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,507
If the world learns you got pregnant
and had kids at 16,

118
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,637
you and our agency are both over.

119
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,766
Doctor, what do you think?

120
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
<i>You have the right</i>
<i>to make the final decision.</i>

121
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,901
<i>Think about it very carefully.</i>

122
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,156
<i>As a doctor, that's all I can say.</i>

123
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,494
As a doctor, that is.

124
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,371
Whoa, seriously?

125
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,414
IDOL MARRIES COMEDIAN

126
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,082
And I liked MIU…

127
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,293
<i>How timely.</i>

128
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,210
Wait.

129
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:46,424
If I die now, isn't there a chance
I can be reborn as the child of an idol?

130
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,843
That's a creepy thought.

131
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:53,598
But hey, would you be able to cheer for
an idol with a man and a kid?

132
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,481
<i>Even if you have a man you like,</i>
<i>I'll continue to support you.</i>

133
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,109
<i>But if you give birth to a child,</i>

134
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,946
<i>I won't be able to see you rise</i>
<i>to the top anymore.</i>

135
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,909
<i>Fans' opinions are selfish, huh?</i>

136
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,661
<i>Don't you think so, Sarina?</i>

137
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
Oh.

138
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,539
Doctor.

139
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,208
Hoshino.

140
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,085
The cold night winds will hurt your body.

141
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,379
I'm dressed warm, so don't worry!

142
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,677
I chose this place because of the CEO's
recommendation, but it really is nice!

143
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,641
You can already see the stars
really clearly in the evening.

144
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,603
You could never see this in Tokyo.

145
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:47,318
Did you come all this way
because you'd draw attention in Tokyo?

146
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,780
Huh? Have I told you about my job?

147
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:56,202
A long time ago,
I had a patient who was a fan of yours.

148
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,162
Yikes.

149
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:02,750
Since the doctors are mainly old men here,
I thought I wouldn't get noticed.

150
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,379
I guess I can't hide my overflowing aura!
What a problem!

151
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,964
<i>Her confidence is cute.</i>

152
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,842
Will you stop being an idol?

153
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,427
Why? Nope.

154
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,721
But then…

155
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,894
I don't have a family,
so I've always dreamed of having one.

156
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,856
There are twins in my belly, right?

157
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,070
I'm sure it'll become a lively
and fun family then!

158
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,783
You're going to have children
and continue as an idol.

159
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,660
That would mean…

160
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,621
That's right.
I'm not going to announce it.

161
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:46,002
Idols are just an image. They're creatures
that shine with the magic of lies.

162
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,839
Lies are the ultimate form of love.

163
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:54,302
Once you can hide a kid or two,
that's when you're a first-rate idol!

164
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,223
No matter how many lies you build up
and how tough you have it,

165
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,269
it's a fun job where you
seemingly sing with joy on stage!

166
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,400
But I do want that "joy" part
to be true though.

167
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,279
Nobody really realizes it,
but we have feelings and lives too.

168
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,327
The joys of being a mother
and the joys of being an idol.

169
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,370
Normally, it's either or.

170
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,040
But I want both!

171
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,584
Ai Hoshino is greedy like that.

172
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:33,049
<i>This idol named Ai was much bolder,</i>
<i>more cunning, and stronger than I thought.</i>

173
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,260
<i>She was beaming like the evening star.</i>

174
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,846
We've agreed.

175
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,764
Huh?

176
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,934
<i>The doctor and the fan inside me</i>
<i>are in agreement.</i>

177
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,228
Ai Hoshino.

178
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,192
I guarantee that you will
safely deliver healthy babies.

179
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,405
<i>If that's what you call joy,</i>
<i>I'll accept it.</i>

180
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,118
<i>Since you are hopelessly an idol,</i>

181
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,790
<i>and I am hopelessly a fan of yours.</i>

182
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,295
Now, going forward,

183
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,091
let's use an alias at our hospital.

184
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,008
Okay.

185
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,304
In your case,
there's a high chance of a C-section.

186
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,222
What?

187
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,059
If the babies have large skulls,

188
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:29,063
with your body type, the pelvic opening
usually isn't wide enough.

189
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,439
Really.

190
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,692
A scar on her belly would affect her work.

191
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,195
Doctor, isn't there another way?

192
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,533
Epidural anesthesia, sophrology, no…

193
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,452
Anything's fine.
My body's super strong anyway.

194
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,079
Ai…

195
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,706
It'll be fine,
I'm sure I can have a natural birth.

196
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,753
I mean, they're my kids!
I'm sure they'll have small, pretty faces!

197
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,464
You and your carefree attitude…

198
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,554
<i>Maybe the reason I became a doctor</i>
<i>was for this moment.</i>

199
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,975
<i>I'll make sure you deliver</i>
<i>more safely and successfully.</i>

200
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,728
<i>I'll protect your family.</i>

201
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,316
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I do have mixed feelings about it.</i>

202
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,278
<i>But I hide them the best I can.</i>

203
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,781
<i>"Lies are a form of love."</i>

204
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,743
<i>Stars are incredible because those words</i>
<i>are starting to sound real.</i>

205
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,455
FORTY WEEKS

206
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,207
ESTIMATED DUE DATE

207
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,626
Doctor, good night.

208
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,336
But rush over if I call.

209
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,423
Okay. My house's close by too.

210
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,384
Well, even if I can't,
another doctor will come.

211
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,844
No, I want you, Doctor.

212
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,555
I'm joking. I'll see you later.

213
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,473
Okay.

214
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,937
<i>Once this is over,</i>
<i>my connection with Ai will end,</i>

215
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,315
<i>and we'll return to</i>
<i>being an idol and a fan.</i>

216
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,485
<i>I saw a bit of her real self,</i>

217
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:02,031
<i>but I actually came to like</i>
<i>her frank personality.</i>

218
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,868
<i>I wish for her life to be full of joy</i>
<i>from the bottom of my…</i>

219
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,662
Are you the doctor
in charge of Ai Hoshino?

220
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,876
She's using an alias.

221
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,794
Even if you saw her at the hospital,

222
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,048
how do you know her last name
which is not known to the public?

223
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,760
Do you know her personally?
Can I ask your name?

224
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,845
Hey!

225
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>Could he be a stalker?</i>
<i>Right when she's about to deliver too…</i>

226
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,860
<i>Damn it! Making me run through</i>
<i>these mountain paths…</i>

227
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,154
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

228
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:02,675
<i>Ugh, that scared me.</i>
<i>My mind went blank all of a sudden.</i>

229
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,761
<i>Oh, my phone.</i>

230
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,972
<i>Did Ai go into labor?</i>

231
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,640
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

232
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,434
<i>It's so dark, I can't tell.</i>

233
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,979
<i>Wait, my body won't move.</i>

234
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,231
<i>I need to hurry and go.</i>

235
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,528
<i>I promised her that I'll make sure</i>
<i>she delivers healthy babies.</i>

236
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,282
<i>I need to get up,</i>

237
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,952
<i>and help deliver her children.</i>

238
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:42,715
<i>Haven't you ever thought, "What if I was</i>
<i>born as the child of a celebrity?"</i>

239
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,430
<i>What if you had the looks and connections</i>
<i>since the time you were born?</i>

240
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,399
<i>If I die now, isn't there a chance</i>
<i>I can be reborn as the child of an idol?</i>

241
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,152
<i>If I could be reborn…</i>

242
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,494
<i>I never seriously thought about it.</i>

243
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,581
<i>I mean, isn't that right?</i>

244
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,423
<i>I never thought something</i>
<i>like that would occur to me.</i>

245
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,738
<i>I always thought someone like me</i>
<i>would go to hell once they died.</i>

246
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,114
<i>But…</i>

247
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,493
Hm?

248
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,997
<i>Once I woke up, I was in heaven.</i>

249
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>This is me now.</i>

250
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,213
What a good boy, Aquamarine!

251
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,092
<i>Anyhow, I've been given a ridiculous name.</i>

252
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,888
<i>Currently, I am living</i>
<i>as the idol Ai Hoshino's son.</i>

253
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,557
<i>Please don't ask me why.</i>

254
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:20,020
<i>Even for me, it took a long time</i>
<i>to accept this reality.</i>

255
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,772
<i>Have I been reborn?</i>

256
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,733
<i>Or is it called "reincarnation" nowadays?</i>

257
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,738
<i>Why do I have memories of my past life?</i>
<i>How does this system work?</i>

258
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:35,703
<i>I am a doctor after all.</i>
<i>I intend to uncover this system one day.</i>

259
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,663
<i>However…</i>

260
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,626
<i>For now, I want to indulge</i>
<i>in this baby life.</i>

261
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,589
<i>This environment where my favorite idol</i>
<i>completely pampers me</i>

262
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,553
<i>really heals my exhausted mind</i>
<i>from my adult life.</i>

263
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,805
G-Goo-goo…

264
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,518
Coming.

265
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,689
<i>Oh yeah, there's another resident</i>
<i>in this house.</i>

266
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,358
What is it, Ruby?

267
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,821
<i>Ruby Hoshino, the baby born as my twin.</i>

268
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,283
<i>This one has a less damaging name.</i>

269
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,745
<i>If it isn't too late, I'd like to switch.</i>

270
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,790
What's wrong, Aqua?

271
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,752
That one's Ruby.
You call yourself their mother?

272
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:30,049
I can't help it, it's hard for me
to remember people's faces and names.

273
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:34,636
Isn't that awful? Men in Japan tend to
idealize the mother figure too much.

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,890
You don't even have a passport.
Don't say something so global!

275
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,019
Besides,
you don't even accept overseas shoots!

276
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:46,857
But I can remember the people
that I think have talent, CEO Sato.

277
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,903
Close. My name is Saitou, you shitty idol.

278
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,363
ICHIGO PRODUCTION
CEO ICHIGO SAITOU

279
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,951
More importantly!
Ai the idol will make her return today.

280
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,287
We're discussing the plan from here.

281
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,707
Your first comeback
will be tonight's music show.

282
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,751
It's live, but you good to go?

283
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,752
Of course.

284
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,798
While Ai is at work,
my wife will watch the kids.

285
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,218
ICHIGO PRODUCTION
MIYAKO SAITOU

286
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,595
Your wife's so young.

287
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:21,058
The other members are also creeped out
by you favoring young girls.

288
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,352
Never knew. I'll be careful.

289
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,854
Can't I bring these two with me?

290
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,856
Of course not!

291
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,358
Don't forget!

292
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,654
If the world finds out you're
a 16-year-old mom with two kids,

293
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,864
your career as an idol will end there.

294
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,451
I'll be asked to take responsibility
and my agency will be done for.

295
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,914
Everyone goes to hell together!

296
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,961
The paperwork to city hall, shopping,
no bringing the kids anywhere!

297
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,547
Only if there's an absolute emergency,

298
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,676
you go out by saying
that you're babysitting our kids!

299
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,052
What?

300
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,638
What a pain, right Ruby?

301
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,390
That's Aqua.

302
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,479
<i>Ai will probably go under</i>
<i>the really bad type of moms.</i>

303
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,108
<i>But the CEO and his wife</i>
<i>will generously support us,</i>

304
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>so maybe it'll work out somehow.</i>

305
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,321
Rehearsal's soon. Let's move.

306
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,489
Okay!

307
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,199
Oops.

308
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,209
That was close!
I almost flashed my boobs to you.

309
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,879
Just keep them covered outside.

310
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,465
<i>No, this isn't good.</i>
<i>I'm too worried about this girl!</i>

311
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,096
B Komachi is on set!

312
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,599
We're B Komachi, nice to meet you.

313
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,100
Yes, nice to meet you.

314
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,148
I don't even have babysitting experience.

315
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,818
Why do I have to do this?

316
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,538
<i>Ai has finally returned today!</i>

317
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,374
<i>Are you okay? Are you eating well?</i>

318
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,460
<i>Yes! I'm eating lots!</i>

319
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,253
<i>Good, she's doing okay.</i>

320
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,548
<i>Oh yeah, speaking of eating, my boy was--</i>

321
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,507
<i>My boy?</i>

322
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:22,262
<i>I meant my kitten! I adopted him recently</i>
<i>while I was taking a break.</i>

323
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,222
<i>Ah.</i>

324
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,309
<i>-Actually, I don't know about her.</i>
<i>-I'm always saying weird things.</i>

325
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,146
You'll be on camera in 30 seconds.

326
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,440
Give us a good performance!

327
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,942
-Yes!
-Yes, we will!

328
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,819
You know B Komachi?

329
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,404
Nah. Not interested.

330
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,950
I heard their music,
but they're average. Neither good nor bad.

331
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,327
But I guess this is what sells.

332
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,286
Right.

333
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,247
Mass-produced idols.

334
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,708
We have to find a compliment,
but what's there to say?

335
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,711
Isn't the center's face
the only praiseworthy thing?

336
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,173
I know the group
but haven't heard of them in months.

337
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,759
-Who squeezed them in?
-Underground idols…

338
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,970
Ichigo Production. Don't know them.

339
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,430
One's got boobs. Make her do gravure.

340
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,724
Call her to dinner for the producer.

341
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,979
<i>In this industry, there are lies</i>
<i>and calculations under the smiles.</i>

342
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,896
10 SECONDS

343
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,190
<i>An empty slot</i>
<i>isn't allowed in broadcasting.</i>

344
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:20,445
<i>And to maximize the performance</i>
<i>of any performer, even the staff will lie.</i>

345
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,781
<i>Same with the higher-ups.</i>

346
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,951
<i>They pretend to make good work,</i>
<i>but they're fixated on numbers.</i>

347
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,329
<i>Jeez, bring it on.</i>

348
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,331
<i>Our Ai…</i>

349
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,959
<i>is a hardcore liar!</i>

350
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,563
<i>That CEO's pretty crazy.</i>

351
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,733
<i>If Ai's secret is exposed,</i>
<i>he risks losing everything.</i>

352
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,529
<i>But I can understand.</i>
<i>There's no way you can't be crazy for her.</i>

353
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,409
<i>If the light before you is too bright,</i>
<i>people simply get burned.</i>

354
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,413
<i>You get pulled in</i>
<i>like moths drawn to a flame.</i>

355
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,666
<i>Even if your wings burn off,</i>
<i>you can't stop.</i>

356
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:20,172
<i>I'm no exception. I'm glad</i>
<i>that I can watch over Ai this close.</i>

357
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:25,260
<i>I'm almost thankful</i>
<i>to the guy who killed me.</i>

358
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:32,601
<i>If this rebirth is a miracle caused</i>
<i>by my perseverance toward her,</i>

359
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,727
<i>it makes sense.</i>

360
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,693
<i>To be honest, I wanted</i>
<i>to help her deliver normal children, but…</i>

361
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:46,073
<i>It's beyond my powers.</i>
<i>You can't win against the supernatural.</i>

362
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,201
<i>So I'm just going to enjoy myself.</i>

363
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,128
Wait.

364
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,426
N Station's on already!
Why didn't you wake me up?!

365
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,474
Oh my gosh! Mama's too cute!

366
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,060
All viewers should pay
hundreds of millions to watch!

367
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,854
Isn't her expression
when she turns just awesome?

368
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,024
She's so wicked,
she might as well be a demon! My gosh!

369
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,903
I just changed my diaper,
but I might wet myself again!

370
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,282
She has a great face, great style,
and great singing.

371
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,452
Our mom is seriously too talented!

372
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,996
I gotta rewatch the recording right away!

373
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:40,460
Live shows are meant to be watched live,
so why didn't you wake me?

374
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,756
These bodies get ridiculously sleepy,
so let's both cooperate!

375
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,842
I tried waking you several times.

376
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,885
Oh, seriously?

377
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,806
<i>This idiot was also reborn from someone,</i>
<i>just like me.</i>

378
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,519
<i>I actually noticed it pretty early on.</i>

379
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,189
Huh? Drop dead!

380
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,067
You apes who can't understand
talent and beauty!

381
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,237
Her performance quality proves
she's better!

382
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,157
It's inevitable that management
would favor her!

383
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,951
I bet you're an ugly hag anyway!

384
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,496
Look at a mirror before you say
that again, you bag!

385
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,039
Ugh, can't believe this!

386
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,877
<i>She was looking up, "B Komachi Ai,"</i>

387
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,505
<i>and having fierce reply battles</i>
<i>with haters on social media.</i>

388
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,507
Are you…

389
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,886
the same as me?

390
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,429
Uh…

391
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,724
A baby just talked! How creepy!

392
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,683
You too.

393
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,644
<i>I can't help but think</i>

394
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,607
<i>how I really wanted to help Ai deliver</i>
<i>some normal children.</i>

395
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,192
Oh my gosh!

396
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,863
Recording it once to watch it forever
is wicked cost-efficient!

397
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,407
<i>Not some weird twins like us.</i>

398
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,623
Ai.

399
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,541
Ai.

400
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,254
You liar. How dare you have kids!

401
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,715
Why?

402
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,550
Why?

403
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,347
You tricked me!

404
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,183
Aqua.

405
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,936
Are you hungry? You want my milk?

406
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,774
Oh, you don't?

407
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,486
Aqua sure likes his bottle.

408
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,406
Look at him drink!

409
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:39,871
<i>As an adult, I feel that having an idol</i>
<i>breastfeed me crosses the line.</i>

410
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,625
Yes, yes.

411
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,252
My milk again?

412
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,547
Ruby sure likes breast milk.

413
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,052
<i>This bastard…</i>

414
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,432
It's time for work.

415
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,642
Okay!

416
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,271
I'll be going then.

417
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,482
Have a nice day.

418
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,984
Bye-bye!

419
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,029
Can't you show some restraint?

420
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:13,947
Why?

421
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:18,743
As her daughter, the law of nature says
I must suckle on Mama's boobs.

422
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,413
It's a natural right
that I've been granted.

423
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,750
Just asking, but were you a female
in your past life too?

424
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,668
Yeah.

425
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,505
Then, I guess that's borderline okay.

426
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,674
Your jealousy is gross!

427
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,345
Well, a grown man breastfeeding
does sound ethically wrong!

428
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,933
I'm so glad I was born a female,
so I can rightfully suckle on boobs!

429
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,312
From my ethical perspective,
that's still wrong though.

430
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,814
Poor Mama.

431
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,652
She would never think her own child
is her otaku. That's seriously gross.

432
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,573
Oh, poor Mama. I'll protect you for life.

433
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,908
You're definitely more gross.

434
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,791
I need to change my diaper, so go away.

435
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,376
Sure, sure.

436
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,261
Why do I have to do this job?

437
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,390
Aren't I the CEO's wife?

438
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,853
I married him because I thought
I could work with pretty boys.

439
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,774
But instead, my job is to care
for a 16-year-old idol's kids?!

440
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,777
A single mom with an unknown father?!

441
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,236
That's way too shady!

442
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,657
First of all, I didn't get married
to become a babysitter!

443
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,326
Huh?

444
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:45,121
Being able to serve Mama
should bring you nothing but pure joy.

445
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,956
What's wrong with her head?

446
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,294
Well, there is some validity
to what she's saying.

447
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,383
Ugh.

448
00:27:56,466 --> 00:28:00,053
Wait, isn't this a cover-up of a scandal?

449
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,807
I know.

450
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,560
If I sell this story to a tabloid,
I could become rich.

451
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,773
Just screw everything! Let's do this!

452
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,818
Uh, this is bad! What do we do, kill her?!

453
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,779
Not possible, we're no match for an adult.

454
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,282
I was just kidding about that,
but were you being serious?

455
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,744
<i>If we let her be,</i>
<i>she'll surely become a threat.</i>

456
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,329
<i>But…</i>

457
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,499
What do we do?!

458
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,627
She's taking pictures
of the maternity handbook!

459
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,546
Rather, this is our chance.

460
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,964
I got an idea.

461
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:42,220
With this money, I'll push my host
up to the top of the monthly rankings.

462
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,431
Oh, pitiful girl.

463
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,934
The thirst in your heart cannot
be quenched by champagne.

464
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,060
Who's there?!

465
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,900
I-I am the messenger of god.

466
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,613
Your reckless actions
can no longer be overlooked!

467
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,366
Messenger of god?

468
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,704
Wait, a baby just talk… No way.

469
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:12,041
According to your common sense,
can babies speak? Face the truth.

470
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:18,089
Uh-uh! Even if you say god sent you,
I don't believe in that stuff, so…

471
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,468
Oh, I know! I'm getting punked!

472
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,847
It must be a show that Ai will be on
to punk the manager! That's it!

473
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,893
This sure is an elaborate prank.
Where are the cameras?

474
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,687
<i>Guess it was too far-fetched.</i>

475
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:37,025
Come on, Ruby,
climbing onto the table is danger…

476
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,487
Know your place.
I am the incarnation of Amaterasu.

477
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,448
The god you people speak of.

478
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,284
God?

479
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:51,498
You have been blinded by money,
nearly abandoning your destined mission.

480
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,707
Destined mission?

481
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,961
<i>Ai Hoshino was chosen</i>
<i>by the god of entertainment.</i>

482
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,674
<i>And her children are twins who are</i>
<i>also destined for a great mission.</i>

483
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,137
'Tis your destined mission
to protect them.

484
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,848
Your actions go against the gods.

485
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,268
If this lasts,
divine punishment awaits you.

486
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,311
Divine punishment?!

487
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,021
What divine punishment?!

488
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,481
Specifically?!

489
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,275
Specifically? Specifically…

490
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,860
You die.

491
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,903
Yes, you die!

492
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,864
No! That's too specific!

493
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,576
What should I do?

494
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,162
The answer is simple.

495
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,791
You must protect our secret.

496
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:39,712
And care for us
by following everything we say.

497
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,880
<i>Everything…</i>

498
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:45,260
<i>If you do, getting remarried to a handsome</i>
<i>actor may no longer be just a dream.</i>

499
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,261
For real?!

500
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,888
I'll do it! I'll do anything you say!

501
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,057
Even lick your insoles!

502
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,851
That will not be necessary.

503
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,772
Remarrying a hot guy!

504
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,985
Was this okay?

505
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,238
Either way, there's a limit
to what infants can do.

506
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,532
Now, we can go outside too.

507
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,700
Yay!

508
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,662
But that was pretty good acting
back there.

509
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,039
Were you an actress somewhere?

510
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,125
Uh-uh. My first time.

511
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,587
First time? Didn't you do plays at school?

512
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:25,341
I was raised in an unusual environment.

513
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,052
Hm. Then it must be talent.

514
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,929
Maybe you're a future actress.

515
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,765
The future…

516
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,312
I've never even thought of it.

517
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,194
<i>I have a sister now.</i>

518
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,364
<i>She's a weird girl who's an idol otaku.</i>

519
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,825
<i>However…</i>

520
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:57,332
Ai's dancing is so sharp!
She seriously has charisma!

521
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,583
Hm.

522
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,544
I like Ai the most in the world,

523
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,006
but I like you just as much, Doctor!

524
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,551
<i>Her passion whenever she spoke about Ai</i>

525
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,679
was exactly like yours,

526
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,014
Sarina.

527
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,434
What? Did you call me?

528
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,353
My bad, did I wake you?

529
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,396
No, I didn't.

530
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,483
If you're gonna sleep, go to the futon.

531
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,200
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

532
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,245
<i>It can't be…</i>

533
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,999
<i>Sarina was my name in my past life anyway.</i>

534
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,630
<i>A few months had passed</i>
<i>since Ai made her return as an idol.</i>

535
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,634
<i>B Komachi's great comeback…</i>

536
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,012
<i>was not exactly happening.</i>

537
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,974
My salary this month is 200 thousand yen.

538
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,435
Hey, isn't our agency's salary too low?

539
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,147
Didn't our last song rank third
on the Oricon Singles Chart?

540
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,274
Isn't the middleman's cut too big?

541
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,068
What's the matter suddenly?

542
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:11,864
We don't do manufacturing to distribution.
We're just a tiny talent agency.

543
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,867
You should know we have low profits.

544
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,037
I realized the world is all about money.

545
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,873
What an ugly truth you realized.

546
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,167
It's fun being an idol,

547
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,380
so I wouldn't have minded staying
this way if it were just myself.

548
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:33,094
But to send these kids to a good school
or let them do extracurricular activities…

549
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,223
To give them more options,
I need to become even more popular,

550
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,435
and earn more money, right?

551
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,981
At this rate,
I can't make these kids happy.

552
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,405
I wish a job for a commercial
or movie would come in.

553
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,115
A big company at that.

554
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,744
First off, quit buying
that expensive ice cream.

555
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,124
I'm off to my lessons.

556
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,835
Be good kids while I'm gone.

557
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:13,217
Hey, don't idols make
like a million yen a month?

558
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,844
Of course not.

559
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,179
Of course not?!

560
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,892
<i>Royalties for music and TV appearance fees</i>
<i>are split between the members.</i>

561
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,604
<i>If their merch doesn't sell,</i>
<i>concerts are in the red.</i>

562
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,106
<i>And costume fees are deducted</i>
<i>from the salary.</i>

563
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,942
Only a handful of idols
make a million yen a month.

564
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,947
What, the money isn't reaching the hardest
working people? This world's doomed!

565
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,157
Oh, I know!

566
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:41,496
<i>Why don't all otakus take turns offering</i>
<i>their livers to Ai, and we sell them…</i>

567
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,748
<i>Your mindset is what's doomed.</i>

568
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,460
<i>Stop with your post-apocalyptic</i>
<i>religious views.</i>

569
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,923
<i>She can sing, dance, and has a great face.</i>

570
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,511
<i>She takes lessons, does voice training,</i>
<i>and practices choreography at home.</i>

571
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,972
<i>B Komachi should be a popular group…</i>

572
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,851
Hey, manager!

573
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,521
Why isn't our Ai getting any work?!

574
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,857
You shitty management! Market her more!

575
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,818
It's not as easy as you say.

576
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,447
To sum it up, idol groups are a system
where about a dozen people work as one

577
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,535
to fight over the same jobs
against a single celebrity.

578
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,664
<i>We're barely getting work</i>
<i>selling as a set right now.</i>

579
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,543
<i>If she wants to work alone,</i>
<i>that'll be a tough wall to break through.</i>

580
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,505
<i>There are girls</i>
<i>who graduate being idols to work solo,</i>

581
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:37,510
<i>but can't get jobs alone, so they work</i>
<i>at high-end restaurants in Roppongi.</i>

582
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,847
<i>And there are tons of former idols</i>
<i>who become "Minato Girls"</i>

583
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,932
<i>who are paid to drink to get by.</i>

584
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,433
I don't really know, but…

585
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,394
Tokyo's a scary place.

586
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,605
I do recognize that Ai is amazing.

587
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,859
But that's only within the idol field.

588
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,782
<i>You need a special skill of your own</i>
<i>to survive in the world of entertainment.</i>

589
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,537
<i>Because jobs that you can profit from</i>
<i>won't be for "somebody in B Komachi,"</i>

590
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,415
<i>they have to be jobs that only Ai can do.</i>

591
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,920
Just being an overachiever
as an idol isn't enough.

592
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,307
Ai, you look a little down.

593
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,643
You just recovered,
so don't push yourself, okay?

594
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,020
That's not it!

595
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:33,149
I missed lunch, so I'm super hungry!

596
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,359
What's that? Your foodie image?

597
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,113
-Let's do that part again.
-Sure, okay!

598
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,365
<i>I can't get into the mood.</i>

599
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,326
<i>I'm gonna egosurf.</i>

600
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,539
GOOD OR BAD, AI HAS A PRO'S SMILE
IT LOOKS INHUMAN…

601
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,503
<i>He's got me there.</i>

602
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,634
CONGRATULATIONS
B KOMACHI

603
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,344
A promotional event!

604
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,803
A mini concert!

605
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,515
This is something
you can only win in a lottery!

606
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,853
This is my first time
properly seeing Mama's stage.

607
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,104
Listen carefully.

608
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,566
I brought you two because you insisted,

609
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,320
but I'm the one who's going to get
reprimanded if the CEO finds out.

610
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,031
No cheering, running, or talking!

611
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,243
Keep your pacifiers on
and stay quiet, okay?

612
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:30,706
That's right, Ruby. Just don't do anything
that catches people's attention.

613
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,794
Anything that tips off
our relation to Ai--

614
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,420
You don't have to tell me.

615
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,800
You saw how upset Mama was.

616
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,512
I'm here because I'm worried about her.

617
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,638
We're not here to have fun…

618
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:50,309
<i>Today, we have three members</i>
<i>of B Komachi here!</i>

619
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,950
B Komachi!

620
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,452
B Komachi!

621
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,706
GOOD OR BAD, AI HAS A PRO'S SMILE

622
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,085
<i>Whatever you say, I am a pro after all.</i>

623
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,461
IT LOOKS INHUMAN…

624
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,172
<i>I don't really understand.</i>

625
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,342
<i>Aren't you the ones</i>
<i>demanding me to be inhuman?</i>

626
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,638
<i>I study my smile in the mirror</i>
<i>and modify it to the millimeter.</i>

627
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,599
<i>How I narrow my eyes, how I grin…</i>

628
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,101
<i>It's all calculated.</i>

629
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,730
<i>I always put on the smile</i>
<i>that pleases people the most.</i>

630
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,900
<i>I am made of lies after all.</i>

631
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,947
…Goo-goo! Ga-ga! Goo-goo…

632
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,075
What's with those babies?!
They're doing the <i>otagei</i>!

633
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,077
Their movements are too sharp for infants!

634
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,915
<i>What did you say about being worried?</i>
<i>You're enjoying it more than anyone!</i>

635
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,293
<i>It was pure instinct!</i>

636
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,753
Wow.

637
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,504
What the… That's amazing.

638
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,303
<i>My babies are so cuuute!</i>

639
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,891
Retweeted 210,000 times.

640
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,561
Even the reposted video
has two million views.

641
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:20,232
I know that baby content trends easily,
but this is a little too…

642
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,568
Come with me.

643
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,738
WHAT'S HER NAME?

644
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,282
DID AI SMILE LIKE THIS?
MY IMPRESSION OF HER CHANGED

645
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,658
LIKE TROUBLESOME OTAKUS

646
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,121
THIS IS IT! THIS!

647
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,581
I see.

648
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,042
So this is what you want.

649
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,921
Now, I know!

650
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,466
<i>One year later.</i>

651
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:51,097
<i>We became old enough to walk and talk</i>
<i>without drawing suspicion.</i>

652
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,306
<i>And my sister…</i>

653
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,724
Mama! Mama!

654
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,351
Hmm?

655
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,436
Pat me on the head!

656
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,647
There, there.

657
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,402
<i>She became the definition of a creepy</i>
<i>spoiled fan who calls their idol "Mama."</i>

658
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,155
Ahh, I'm ascending to heaven!

659
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,243
Where did you learn such difficult words?

660
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,911
Don't tell me…

661
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,123
Umm.

662
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,626
<i>Can Ai be suspecting us?</i>

663
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,337
You're like an insane prodigy.

664
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,508
<i>That being a needless worry,</i>
<i>we're spending our days in peace.</i>

665
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,884
Must be genetic.

666
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,305
<i>Modeling, radio assistant,</i>

667
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,891
<i>Ai was steadily gaining work.</i>

668
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,311
<i>And her job today could be called</i>
<i>the culmination of her efforts.</i>

669
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm excited about
your first TV drama, Mama!

670
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,233
It's a minor role though.

671
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,903
Listen up, you two.

672
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,990
I'm taking you both because you insisted,

673
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:55,744
but don't ever call Ai "Mama" on the set.

674
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,873
Don't forget that
you're supposed to be my kids.

675
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,834
Yes, yes. Mama, pat me on the head.

676
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,544
Me too, Mama!

677
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,046
Mama, gimme me an allowance.

678
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,343
I'm Ai from Ichigo Production.
Nice working with you today.

679
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,137
Nice working with you.

680
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,066
Is something wrong, Director?

681
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,318
No, not really.

682
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,611
He's kind of scary.

683
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,528
His face is.

684
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,947
Huh? Who are these kids?

685
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,741
Uh, these are my kids.

686
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,119
A manager bringing their kids on set?

687
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,208
The work-style reform bill?

688
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,459
Huh?

689
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,002
Times have changed.

690
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:48,047
Well, there are people
who bring dogs on set too.

691
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,886
-Are you sleep-deprived?
-Can you tell?

692
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,347
Twins! How cute!

693
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,225
<i>Oh, I think this girl</i>
<i>is that gravure model.</i>

694
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,062
<i>That one's "the young actress</i>
<i>that's too cute for her talent."</i>

695
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,022
Goo-goo! Ga-ga!

696
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,774
<i>Stop trying to act cute.</i>

697
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,236
<i>This is bad. My body can't take this.</i>

698
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,197
Huh?

699
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,158
You're that manager's kid.

700
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,372
I don't mind you being here,
but I'll kick you out if you start crying.

701
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:26,335
Uh, we're babies, but we shall make sure
to never cause such interruptions!

702
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:30,631
We understand it is the minimum rule
to not disturb the filming process.

703
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,676
We kindly ask
for your continued business with Ai…

704
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,803
This baby talks like crazy!

705
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,180
Where did you learn those words?

706
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,765
A bit on YouTube.

707
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,060
YouTube's incredible! Times have changed!

708
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:48,190
I've seen many mature child actors,
but I've never seen one this mature.

709
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,526
Are you an actor too?

710
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,945
Well, I don't do that type of thing.

711
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,533
You'd be interesting to have on screen.
I wanna use you for something.

712
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,660
This is my card.

713
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,246
If you join an agency, call me.

714
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,542
No, if you want to give me work,
please pass it to Ai instead.

715
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,377
Oh, that idol.

716
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,715
She has an excellent face.
If she's lucky, she'll survive.

717
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,509
Luck? When she has an excellent face?

718
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,178
Listen, there are three types of actors.

719
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,139
Look at them there.

720
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,349
One is the star actor.

721
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,020
Their job is to bring in customers.

722
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,897
They serve the same purpose as an ad,
so the pay is good.

723
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,233
Next is the talented type.

724
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:36,322
They ensure the quality of the work.
Their job is to uphold the company brand.

725
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,199
The last one is the new face.

726
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,785
No one's expecting
acting skills from them.

727
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,663
As long as they're refreshing
to see on screen, they pass.

728
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,834
It's also to let future stars
build experience.

729
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,378
Well, it's an industry-wide investment.

730
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:57,509
This means all those new faces there
are in the stage of being an investment.

731
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,970
You either win the viewers or the staff.

732
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,349
Without either, you'll be replaced
by the next newbie.

733
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:09,355
If any of those new faces survive
within this set, it's a big success.

734
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,023
That's the world we're in.

735
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,943
The ones who survive are
only the top class.

736
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,696
Hm. Then she'll be fine.

737
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,074
Because Ai is a top-class idol.

738
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,077
Uh, there's no point
in being a top-class idol.

739
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,036
Huh?

740
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,580
Director! The run-through is ready.

741
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,540
Okay, I'll watch it here.

742
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,584
Ready…

743
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,796
What are you saying?

744
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,714
You want me to ask Toma?

745
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,424
Hey, don't ever do that, okay?!

746
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,969
Aren't you always with him?

747
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,223
Her acting is average,
but she draws attention.

748
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,684
Right? She was saying earlier…

749
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:52,481
On stage, you have to look cute
for everyone from every angle,

750
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,986
but you just need to be cute
for one person here, the camera.

751
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,865
If it's the same as a music video,
it's my specialty.

752
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,617
You did it! I'll…

753
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,412
A music video perspective?

754
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,579
Times have changed.

755
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:11,208
Oh! It's really good,
so you should definitely watch it!

756
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,960
I'll even lend you the DVD!

757
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,545
You're too loud.

758
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,301
<i>It's too early. You can always challenge…</i>

759
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,720
I can't wait for Mama's acting!

760
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,889
We did take a lot of scenes.

761
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,015
<i>It's almost time.</i>

762
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,226
It started!

763
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,061
<i>Are you kind of upset?</i>

764
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,187
<i>No.</i>

765
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,480
<i>Did I do something?</i>

766
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,648
This is the scene!

767
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,150
<i>What's with him?</i>

768
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,734
Oh, it's Mama!

769
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,361
Close up on her!

770
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,196
<i>Huh? Is something wrong?</i>

771
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,614
<i>Wait, Toma!</i>

772
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,533
<i>Miki, why are you here?</i>

773
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,827
<i>That's why we should've never met.</i>

774
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,247
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

775
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,293
What? That's it?!

776
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,837
That was only one scene!

777
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,297
They cut out too much!

778
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,341
Was my acting that bad?

779
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,260
That's not true!

780
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,014
Yes?

781
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,433
<i>Hey, Director! What happened?!</i>

782
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,560
Oh, the mature baby.

783
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,188
You didn't use Ai at all!

784
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,442
<i>Oh, that. It was a shame</i>
<i>when it turned out so well.</i>

785
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,776
Then how come?!

786
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,778
The lead actress's agency

787
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:25,115
markets her as "the young actress
that's too cute for her talent."

788
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:29,703
<i>So, what would happen</i>
<i>if a cuter face is in the same shot?</i>

789
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,331
<i>That'd affect her marketing image, right?</i>

790
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,168
<i>Ai was just too cute for that screen.</i>

791
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,379
So due to the higher-ups' wishes,

792
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,591
we had to edit her out
as much as possible.

793
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,926
<i>What's with that…</i>

794
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:48,138
The cast's screen time is set
by the power balance between companies.

795
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,140
So think of it as an accident.

796
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,850
I can't accept it.

797
00:46:56,146 --> 00:47:01,318
You can dream of working in showbiz,
but showbiz is no glamorous dream.

798
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,571
It's not a place for art,
but for business.

799
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:09,034
But I do understand your point,
and feel bad about it too.

800
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:14,164
<i>It might not exactly make up for it,</i>
<i>but I want to give Ai some work.</i>

801
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,251
<i>It's for a film. No complaints, right?</i>

802
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,252
Seriously?

803
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,169
<i>But…</i>

804
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,090
on the condition that you're cast too.

805
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,510
Listen, Mature Baby.

806
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:32,057
In Japan, the casting is usually
all decided by the higher-ups already.

807
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,353
The more money goes into the project,
the more it has to succeed.

808
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:40,941
The higher-ups have their own battle
to get actors who can call an audience.

809
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,862
The only directors who have
casting rights are either super bigshots

810
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,324
or super low-budget
small-scale film directors.

811
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,202
Now, which one do I look like?

812
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,080
A super bigshot--

813
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,124
And wrong!

814
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,294
This is a low-budget film set.

815
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,215
Director, thank you for
taking care of Aqua today.

816
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,468
No, no. Has that one issue
been worked out?

817
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:13,181
I believe so. Aqua belongs
to Ichigo Production starting this month.

818
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,560
People get mad if I use a child
who isn't with an agency.

819
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:20,480
If it's acting,
I'm sure my sister is better than me.

820
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,524
No, I want you.

821
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,693
I'm casting Ai in exchange for you.

822
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,571
This is called a barter in this industry.

823
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,698
This is basic knowledge, so remember it.

824
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,827
Your appearance
was bartered for Ai to be cast?

825
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:38,749
That scary director seems
to really like you, Aqua.

826
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,710
What did you do to end up this way?

827
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,920
I didn't do anything special.

828
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:49,009
Old-timers like being treated casually
by young people for some reason,

829
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,219
so I purposely don't act too polite.

830
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,388
What a snotty baby.

831
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:58,644
<i>I used to work with grandpas and grandmas,</i>
<i>so I know how to deal with my elders.</i>

832
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,355
<i>Who knew this odd skill would come to use?</i>

833
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,815
Mama! Mama!

834
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,612
I wanna go back to Mama's place!
Why isn't Mama here?!

835
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,156
Ai films on a different day.

836
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:15,535
I wanna go home and goo-goo!
I wanna ga-ga in Mama's chest!

837
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,622
<i>Isn't she embarrassed</i>
<i>to do that at her age?</i>

838
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,749
<i>Not that I know how old she is.</i>

839
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,254
This is a place for pros!

840
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,591
If you're here to play, go home!

841
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,885
Um…

842
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,304
I'm Kana Arima, this film's actress.

843
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,057
Oh, isn't she that one girl?

844
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,517
Um, what was it again?

845
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,603
<i>The genius child actress</i>
<i>who licks baking soda?</i>

846
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,523
<i>The genius child actress</i>
<i>who can cry in ten seconds!</i>

847
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:49,236
Everyone says my crying in TV dramas
are amazing! I'm amazing!

848
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,489
I don't really like this kid.

849
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,409
She feels fake,
so my gut says I can't stand her.

850
00:49:55,492 --> 00:50:00,205
Sometimes people are strangely hard
on child actors, like you.

851
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,083
I know that you got in with connections.

852
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,838
At the script reading stage,
you and that idol weren't even in this.

853
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,424
Mama said the director squeezed them in!

854
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,467
You know that's a no-no!

855
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,511
No, that's not exactly--

856
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:19,224
I saw the TV drama the director shot
before, but that idol was barely in it.

857
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,350
Huh?

858
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:25,063
I bet her acting was so bad
they had to cut it all out.

859
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,525
But I guess she's good at
kissing up to people.

860
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,319
Assistant Director, hold my bag!

861
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,739
Um, wait just one second.

862
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,657
Bro…

863
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,995
I know. She's just a kid…
I won't kill her.

864
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,750
<i>To simply sum up the plot of the film…</i>

865
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,086
<i>A woman who is not confident</i>
<i>in her appearance</i>

866
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:53,133
<i>gets plastic surgery at a sketchy hospital</i>
<i>deep in the mountains for some reason.</i>

867
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:58,597
<i>We are the creepy children that</i>
<i>the woman meets at the village entrance.</i>

868
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:03,393
Greetings, visitor. We welcome you.

869
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:08,315
Please make yourself at home.

870
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:12,527
<i>As expected of a genius child actress.</i>
<i>She's good.</i>

871
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,824
<i>If I tried doing the same,</i>
<i>the difference would be painful to watch.</i>

872
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,452
<i>Even a complete amateur</i>
<i>can tell that much.</i>

873
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,788
<i>Then what do I do?</i>

874
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:27,334
<i>In normal circumstances, I would</i>
<i>just have to act like a creepy child.</i>

875
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,712
<i>But that's not</i>
<i>what's being demanded of me.</i>

876
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,089
<i>What the director wants is probably…</i>

877
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,052
In this village, there is only one inn.

878
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:41,306
Once you check in,
you may explore the area.

879
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,851
<i>This scene was one</i>
<i>that was added later on.</i>

880
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,855
<i>After learning of me,</i>
<i>the director wrote it with me in mind.</i>

881
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,609
<i>If I consider that fact,</i>
<i>I shouldn't have to act.</i>

882
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,613
<i>Following the stage directions is enough.</i>

883
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:01,117
<i>He never said it out loud,</i>
<i>but what the director means to say is…</i>

884
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,831
<i>Even without acting, you're creepy enough.</i>

885
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,750
Now, let me guide you.

886
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,508
Cut! Good!

887
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,760
Looks really good!

888
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,137
Wasn't that just my usual brother?

889
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:27,018
Wow! You gave me the chills.

890
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,229
Really? That's good.

891
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,940
It's not good.

892
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,569
Put that camera away.
Let's take the next one.

893
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,570
Yes, sir!

894
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,655
Director, retake that scene.

895
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,907
Hm? Well, there were no problems.

896
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,659
There's a big problem!

897
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,791
My acting…

898
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,378
was nowhere near as good as that kid.

899
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,006
No! One more time!

900
00:52:56,089 --> 00:53:00,468
Please! I'll do it much better this time!

901
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,971
-One more time! Please!
-Kana.

902
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,605
Mature Baby.

903
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,691
What do you think
is most important as an actor?

904
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,069
Hmm. Talent or having a good sense?

905
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,529
Motivation and effort?

906
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,616
Well, those are important too.

907
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,118
But in the end, it's communication skills.

908
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:29,581
<i>If the other actors or staff</i>
<i>don't like you, you'll lose work fast.</i>

909
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:34,044
<i>There's no future for a bigheaded kid</i>
<i>acting like a diva already.</i>

910
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,172
Did you want to teach her a lesson?

911
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,550
I wasn't thinking
of anything self-righteous like that.

912
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,177
But it's good experience.

913
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:47,682
Your acting was dead on
to how I envisioned it.

914
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,479
That girl was much better.

915
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,940
I was just being my usual self.

916
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,817
But I never said a word to do that.

917
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,195
Reading my mind is communication too.

918
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,991
Of course, acting upon understanding
stage directions is one of the basics.

919
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,829
But actors who can pick up on those
unwritten directions are rare.

920
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,292
Because there's always
a correct image in the director's mind.

921
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,213
Rather than great acting,

922
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,216
become an actor with perfect acting.

923
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,056
Well, I'm not gonna be an actor.

924
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,644
<i>And that was how I got my foot</i>
<i>in the door of this industry.</i>

925
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,360
He has a stage name already.

926
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,905
Aqua. I've memorized it.

927
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,117
I won't lose next time.

928
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:55,000
<i>Three years have now passed</i>
<i>since we were reborn as Ai's children.</i>

929
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,878
<i>The film shot by the director</i>
<i>was somewhat credited,</i>

930
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,548
<i>and he was nominated</i>
<i>for a Director's Prize.</i>

931
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:06,094
<i>Looking back,</i>
<i>I think my acting was pretty good.</i>

932
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,512
<i>But…</i>

933
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,184
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>Ai stole the show in that film.</i>

934
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:19,107
<i>I don't know if that triggered it,</i>
<i>but her work has increased quite a bit.</i>

935
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,192
<i>If I were to describe Ai now,</i>

936
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:25,655
<i>she would be the most trending idol</i>
<i>at the moment probably.</i>

937
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,117
<i>Ai will be 20 soon.</i>

938
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:35,081
<i>We're still spending our days in peace</i>
<i>without being exposed to the public.</i>

939
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,042
<i>Also…</i>

940
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,209
GOROU AMEMIYA DOCTOR MISSING

941
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,796
<i>My body still hasn't been found.</i>

942
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,133
You're looking cute today too! Super cute!

943
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,762
Well, Mama's cuter above all though.

944
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,014
What's this weird rivalry?

945
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,600
<i>We entered kindergarten.</i>

946
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,437
By the way, what were you doing
before you were reborn?

947
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,064
How old are you really?

948
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,066
Um.

949
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,569
<i>If I turn out to be the younger one…</i>

950
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,280
What? I knew you were just a kid.

951
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,617
You'll be listening to me
from now on, kiddo.

952
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,496
Uh, I'm a grown woman!

953
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,083
What an insensitive brat
to ask a woman her age!

954
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,670
Besides, who cares about my past life?!
Stay out of my business!

955
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,091
Well, that's true.

956
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,802
<i>It's depressing to think of my past life.</i>

957
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,388
<i>That's how much</i>
<i>I like my current life now.</i>

958
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,810
<i>Compared to the days of exhausting work,</i>

959
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,855
<i>a kindergartener can just eat, sleep,</i>
<i>and read a book all day. Easy.</i>

960
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,819
<i>But I'm surprised</i>
<i>she can play all out like that.</i>

961
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:49,531
A kindergartener is reading
Natsuhiko Kyogoku's tome…

962
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:54,285
Everyone, it's dance time!

963
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:58,748
Your family will come
watch you dance soon!

964
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,000
So let's do our best to practice!

965
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,461
Okay!

966
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,547
No, I don't wanna!

967
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,423
Oh, Ruby?!

968
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,096
Why did you run off?

969
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,434
Because I can't dance.
Or like, I've never danced before.

970
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,643
Huh?

971
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,939
Were you always cooped up in your room?

972
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,315
Kids nowadays…

973
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,341
I was like a shut-in anyway.

974
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,052
I tried a couple of times,
but I couldn't do it.

975
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,680
I doubt I can do anything athletic.

976
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,728
I don't know what you've been through,
but are you sure about this?

977
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,815
You have a long life ahead of you.

978
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,124
Oh. Are you practicing dancing?

979
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,753
Then Mama will do it with you.

980
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,007
I need to practice an old song
for our next concert.

981
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,645
Mama, that part was a bit weird.

982
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,647
Huh?

983
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,733
Your hand was higher
when you danced at Budokan.

984
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,529
Hey, did you watch my concert videos?

985
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,573
What a good memory!

986
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,533
<i>Of course.</i>

987
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,663
<i>I watched Mama's concert videos hundreds…</i>
<i>No, thousands of times.</i>

988
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,415
<i>I remember all the choreography.</i>

989
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,125
How did it go again?

990
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,920
This part was more…

991
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,797
Oh, are you okay?

992
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,714
Yeah.

993
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:17,220
The way you move…
It's like you're preparing to fall.

994
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,143
<i>Because I was always falling over.</i>

995
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,189
<i>If I didn't brace myself,</i>
<i>I would get hurt.</i>

996
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:37,657
When you're scared of falling,
you fall even more.

997
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,411
Just stand more boldly
and stick out your chest.

998
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,871
You'll be fine.

999
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,082
Trust Mama.

1000
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:52,463
<i>My life was mostly spent</i>
<i>in a hospital room.</i>

1001
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,594
<i>My body was impaired</i>
<i>and it never listened to me.</i>

1002
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,264
<i>So I always admired her from my bed.</i>

1003
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,769
<i>Mama's cool moves</i>
<i>are all engraved into my brain.</i>

1004
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:12,108
<i>All of that light is burned into my eyes.</i>

1005
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,444
<i>She's my light.</i>

1006
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,946
<i>If I could just move like that…</i>

1007
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,616
<i>Move freely like that…</i>

1008
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,826
<i>More!</i>

1009
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,661
<i>Move more!</i>

1010
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,290
<i>My body!</i>

1011
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,718
<i>Oh, it's okay for me to dance!</i>

1012
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,432
<i>This girl…</i>

1013
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,643
<i>So it wasn't just her acting skills.</i>

1014
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,062
<i>Her dancing intuition…</i>

1015
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,565
<i>Plus, she has her mother's good looks.</i>

1016
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,318
<i>What a scary thought…</i>

1017
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:05,495
<i>For some reason, I decided</i>
<i>to contact the guy I broke up with.</i>

1018
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:10,708
Hey, the kids have gotten pretty big now.
Why don't you meet them once?

1019
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,672
No, I'm not talking about
getting back together or anything.

1020
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:20,176
<i>It all started when I overheard</i>
<i>my kids talking.</i>

1021
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,887
I've been trying not to think about it,

1022
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,140
but I wonder who our father is.

1023
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,477
Ugh, just the thought of it
makes my heart sink.

1024
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,106
Stupid, you're upset
over something like that?

1025
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,860
It must have been a virgin birth.
There was no man in the first place.

1026
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,323
<i>They were coming to a weird conclusion,</i>
<i>so I thought this was bad.</i>

1027
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:47,662
Our kids are really smart, so I'm sure
they'll understand our situation.

1028
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,790
Yeah. My new address is…

1029
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,458
Oh, it's Ai!

1030
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,253
Lemme take a picture!

1031
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,672
You seriously like Ai.

1032
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,132
<i>Work is going well.</i>

1033
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,135
<i>I even reached over a million followers.</i>

1034
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,971
<i>The world is looking at me.</i>

1035
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,015
Jeez, this sake is good!

1036
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,394
Here's to your new home! Drink up!

1037
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,896
Wow, it's Mori Izo!

1038
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,981
Stop right there.

1039
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:19,777
Ai won't be 20 until next week.
Wait just a little longer.

1040
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,530
Ah, that's right!

1041
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,198
Hm?

1042
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,869
The drama with Ai as the lead role
has a high viewing rate!

1043
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,663
B Komachi has a packed schedule too,

1044
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,083
and next week,
we're finally performing at the dome!

1045
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,711
He's in a really good mood.

1046
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:41,674
The CEO's dream is to take his idols
that he produced to Tokyo Dome.

1047
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,635
It's also the dream of
everyone at the company.

1048
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,346
Is the dome that great?

1049
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,849
It's different from other venues.

1050
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,811
<i>You can't even book a slot</i>
<i>without going through a broker.</i>

1051
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,648
<i>An experienced staff is required</i>
<i>to control a large audience.</i>

1052
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,360
<i>Even the artist goes through</i>
<i>a strict screening.</i>

1053
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,407
It's a venue that needs a lot of
the staff's time and effort.

1054
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,868
It's not a place you can buy with money.

1055
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,455
Only a handful of artists
can reach that stage.

1056
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,291
The dome is everyone's dream.

1057
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,542
Really.

1058
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,754
<i>If I'm successful, everyone's happy.</i>

1059
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,715
<i>That's why I act happy too.</i>

1060
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,469
It's an important time right now.
Don't cause any scandals!

1061
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,472
No matter what,
don't try to meet the father or anything.

1062
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,140
Of course!

1063
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,433
<i>I am a liar.</i>

1064
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,521
<i>Before I even think,</i>
<i>I always say what's best at the time.</i>

1065
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:40,775
<i>I don't even know what's true</i>
<i>and what's a lie anymore.</i>

1066
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,151
Pat me on my head.

1067
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,779
Hm? There, there.

1068
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:49,617
<i>I was always bad at loving anything.</i>

1069
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:56,833
<i>That's why, I never thought someone</i>
<i>like me could possibly become an idol.</i>

1070
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,794
You said you were recruiting people,

1071
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,588
but for an idol? Me?

1072
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,006
What a laugh.

1073
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,426
Right now,
we're putting together an idol unit

1074
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,804
with our agency's middle school models.

1075
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,014
You can aim for the center role.

1076
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,474
Not interested.

1077
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,143
But I think you're perfect for the role.
Really!

1078
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:21,315
I don't recommend it.
Since I'm from a children's home.

1079
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:27,488
I lived with my single mom, but she got
arrested for theft when I was little.

1080
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,782
So, I was sent to a children's home.

1081
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:35,288
But my mom never came back
to get me even after she got released.

1082
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:40,376
<i>If I scared him a little, I thought</i>
<i>the talent scout would withdraw.</i>

1083
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:44,297
It's okay. I preferred being
at a children's home over getting abused.

1084
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:49,468
I don't have any memories
of loving anybody or being loved.

1085
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,054
Someone like that can't become an idol.

1086
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:55,516
<i>My idea of an idol was</i>

1087
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,813
<i>an innocent being that would</i>
<i>flash smiles and put a smile on everybody.</i>

1088
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,984
<i>The complete opposite of a liar</i>
<i>and misanthrope like me.</i>

1089
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:10,197
Someone like me wouldn't be able
to love the fans or be loved by them.

1090
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,699
I think that's fine.

1091
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,828
It's not a job meant for
normal people anyway.

1092
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,164
That background adds to your personality.

1093
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:22,543
B-But, idols all say stuff like,
"I love you!"

1094
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,711
It's a lie if I--

1095
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,254
It's okay to lie.

1096
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,299
Rather, a beautiful lie is
exactly what the audience wants.

1097
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,134
Lying is a talent too.

1098
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,845
It's okay, lie all you want!

1099
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,807
It's okay?

1100
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,771
To say, "I love you," even if it's a lie?

1101
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,233
Deep down inside,
don't you want to love somebody too?

1102
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:51,697
You just don't know how
and you can't find someone to love.

1103
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:57,078
Just singing and dancing cutely is
an expression of your love for the fans.

1104
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:02,500
Once you become an idol, you'll see
"I love you" in the lyrics all the time.

1105
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:06,462
And as you keep saying
that you love everyone,

1106
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,465
maybe that lie will become true.

1107
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,511
A lie will become true?

1108
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:17,765
<i>After hearing those words,</i>
<i>I decided to become an idol.</i>

1109
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,895
<i>I wanted to love somebody.</i>
<i>I wanted someone to love.</i>

1110
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,857
<i>If I became an idol,</i>
<i>I thought I could love the fans.</i>

1111
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,569
<i>I wanted to say it</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart,</i>

1112
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,489
<i>so I kept spreading my lie saying,</i>
<i>"I love you."</i>

1113
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:39,245
<i>I thought I could love my kids</i>
<i>if I became a mother.</i>

1114
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,166
<i>I still haven't told my kids</i>
<i>that I loved them yet.</i>

1115
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:49,422
<i>If I said those words</i>
<i>and realize that it was a lie…</i>

1116
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,215
<i>The thought of it scares me.</i>

1117
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,760
<i>That's why, I continue to lie today.</i>

1118
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:57,763
<i>That's why I still believe</i>
<i>lies can become true.</i>

1119
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,518
<i>Even if someday, I have to pay the price.</i>

1120
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,604
CAN'T WAIT FOR TODAY'S DOME CONCERT!

1121
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,315
Is that the CEO?

1122
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,735
Yes!

1123
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,240
Congratulations on your dome concert.

1124
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,285
Are the twins doing well?

1125
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,961
Doesn't it hurt?!

1126
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,131
But you hurt me more! It was painful!

1127
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,675
Because you had kids when you're an idol!

1128
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,677
You betrayed your fans, you slut…

1129
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,596
You ignored your fans!

1130
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:23,974
I bet you were laughing at us
behind our backs! You liar!

1131
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,893
After saying that you loved us!

1132
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,021
It was all a lie!

1133
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,732
I was always irresponsible to begin with.

1134
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:36,195
I'm not innocent. I'm sly and dirty.

1135
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,990
I don't know what it means
to love someone.

1136
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,909
So instead,

1137
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:46,914
I always told a pretty lie
that would make everyone happy.

1138
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:52,294
Hoping that one day,
those lies will become true.

1139
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,257
I worked hard and did my best
to put everything into those lies.

1140
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,552
To me, lies are a form of love.

1141
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:04,223
I was trying to express love
in my own way.

1142
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:08,811
I don't know if I was able
to really love you all,

1143
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:12,690
but I sang about love
while wanting to love you.

1144
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:17,903
Praying that someday, it will become true.

1145
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:24,118
Even now, I still want to love you.

1146
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,036
Quit lying.

1147
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,040
I bet you don't even remember me.
You just want me to let you go--

1148
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,917
Ryousuke, right?

1149
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,086
You came to my handshake events.

1150
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,505
Oh, was I wrong?

1151
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:40,634
Sorry, I'm bad at remembering
people's names.

1152
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:44,305
I was happy when you gave me
that star-shaped sand.

1153
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,517
I still have it displayed
in my living room.

1154
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,978
What the hell?

1155
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,439
That's not…

1156
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,736
Just come right away!

1157
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:03,032
Ai! I called an ambulance!

1158
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,327
Jeez, I let my guard down.

1159
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,622
So this is why door chains exist.

1160
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,833
They didn't teach me that
at the children's home.

1161
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:13,876
Don't speak!

1162
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:14,793
<i>The bleeding…</i>

1163
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,254
<i>It's the abdominal aorta, shit!</i>

1164
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,178
I'm sorry.

1165
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:27,848
I don't think I'm going to make it.

1166
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,226
Are you okay?

1167
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,437
Did you get hurt at all, Aqua?

1168
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,356
No…

1169
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,570
I wonder if today's dome concert
will be canceled.

1170
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,323
I feel bad for everyone.

1171
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,160
And just when the film schedule
was being finalized too.

1172
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,162
Please apologize to the director for me.

1173
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:53,624
Hey, what's wrong?

1174
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,627
What's happening over there?

1175
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,505
Don't come, Ruby.

1176
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,341
Tell me!

1177
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,467
Ruby?

1178
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:09,014
Your dancing at the recital
was really good.

1179
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:15,437
I think that you might
become an idol yourself one day, Ruby.

1180
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:21,318
A mother-and-daughter performance
sounds so fun.

1181
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,696
And maybe Aqua might be an actor?

1182
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:29,410
I wonder what kind of adults
you two will become.

1183
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:34,540
Oh, I wish I could see you
with your backpacks on.

1184
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,501
And at the school open house,

1185
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:41,088
I want to hear people say,
"Isn't Ruby's mom super young?"

1186
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,550
I wish I could watch you two

1187
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,469
grow up by your side.

1188
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:52,182
I wasn't a very good mom,

1189
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,729
but I'm glad that I had both of you.

1190
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:58,814
Um, what else?

1191
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:01,400
Oh, I need to say this…

1192
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:03,902
Ruby.

1193
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:05,904
Aqua.

1194
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,699
I love you.

1195
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:13,579
Ah, I finally said it.

1196
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,541
I'm sorry it took me this long to say it.

1197
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,002
I'm so glad.

1198
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:25,466
These words are definitely not a lie.

1199
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,388
Ai?

1200
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,191
Ai?

1201
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:00,793
<i>Ai, from the idol group B Komachi,</i>
<i>has been murdered.</i>

1202
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,921
<i>Early morning today,</i>
<i>in a condominium in Tokyo,</i>

1203
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:07,049
<i>there was a report</i>
<i>of a man stabbing a woman.</i>

1204
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,428
<i>When the police arrived,</i>
<i>the woman believed to be Ai</i>

1205
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:14,932
<i>was stabbed in the abdomen,</i>
<i>bleeding on the floor.</i>

1206
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:17,976
<i>She was pronounced dead at the hospital.</i>

1207
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:22,356
<i>The man thought to be the suspect</i>
<i>was an enthusiastic fan of hers,</i>

1208
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:27,277
<i>and he was declared dead after</i>
<i>attempting suicide a few hours later.</i>

1209
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:31,490
<i>According to the police,</i>
<i>Ai had just moved into a new home.</i>

1210
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,617
<i>It is likely there was an accomplice,</i>

1211
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,953
<i>so the case will be investigated.</i>

1212
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:40,707
<i>The Tokyo Dome concert scheduled today</i>
<i>has announced its cancellation,</i>

1213
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:45,254
<i>and a sea of fans before the venue</i>
<i>are now filled with sorrow.</i>

1214
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,630
AI TO INFINITY
ETERNAL FAVE

1215
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:49,299
<i>The shocking news of</i>
<i>an idol being murdered by a fan</i>

1216
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,594
<i>and the culprit</i>
<i>committing suicide soon after</i>

1217
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,305
<i>spread in less than an hour.</i>

1218
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:59,518
<i>The public's response</i>
<i>was mostly sympathetic.</i>

1219
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,521
<i>But as expected,</i>

1220
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:06,775
<i>there were those attention seekers</i>
<i>who used the dead as entertainment.</i>

1221
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,113
<i>While there were many</i>
<i>selfish assumptions and slander,</i>

1222
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,158
<i>there were those</i>
<i>that were close to the truth.</i>

1223
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,369
What do you mean by "No surprise," huh?!

1224
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:21,331
If an idol falls in love,
it's no surprise she's killed?!

1225
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,083
That can't be right!

1226
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,128
You've all been madly in love with idols,

1227
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:28,797
so how could you deny her
of her own love?!

1228
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:32,551
You're just taking it out on women
since you haven't got a girlfriend!

1229
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,094
That's sick! Drop dead!

1230
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,265
Why is the internet like this?

1231
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:43,479
Mama just died, but all this stuff
makes me wanna die too.

1232
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,732
If you're famous,
can anything be said about you?

1233
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,192
"Price of fame"?

1234
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,652
Quit saying stuff like,
"The customer's always right."

1235
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,447
That's not for you to say!

1236
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,324
Those are just words that

1237
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:58,577
people that have been hurt say
to accept their bitter reality!

1238
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:02,915
Don't use it as an excuse to hurt people!

1239
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:09,963
<i>Once three days passed,</i>
<i>the topic of Ai's death was used up.</i>

1240
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:14,218
<i>After the news of early snowfall</i>
<i>causing traffic jams took over,</i>

1241
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,553
<i>it was never brought up again.</i>

1242
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:20,974
<i>As if the snow covered up Ai's death.</i>

1243
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:26,271
<i>The CEO and his wife</i>
<i>had moved us to their family register,</i>

1244
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:30,025
<i>so we were never covered in the main news.</i>

1245
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:34,321
<i>Because the suspect was already dead</i>
<i>and taking into account my young age,</i>

1246
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:37,574
<i>the police interrogation</i>
<i>ended quite simply.</i>

1247
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:40,410
<i>But the counseling for victims</i>
<i>continued long.</i>

1248
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,373
Would you like
to really become our children?

1249
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,461
Of course, your mother can only be Ai.

1250
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,297
You don't have to think of me
as your mother.

1251
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:57,261
But I think of you two as my own children.

1252
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:58,720
What do you think?

1253
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,948
MORI IZO

1254
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,911
Mama said that I might
become an idol one day.

1255
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,206
Aqua, do you think
that even I could do it?

1256
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,000
What's the point?

1257
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:32,087
If you wanna make money,
it'd be faster with a different job.

1258
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:36,216
And fans will always be selfish.
You'll get bashed if you get a boyfriend.

1259
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,386
Yeah, but still…

1260
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,723
Mama was always shining.

1261
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,642
<i>Ruby will probably get over this.</i>

1262
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:50,606
<i>For better or for worse, I noticed she has</i>
<i>a pure heart after a few years with her.</i>

1263
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,358
<i>But me…</i>

1264
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,361
<i>I've already died once anyway.</i>

1265
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,489
<i>I don't want to live</i>
<i>in a world without Ai.</i>

1266
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:06,496
<i>That stalker was the same guy</i>
<i>who killed me.</i>

1267
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,208
<i>How was he able to find Ai's hospital?</i>

1268
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,128
<i>How did he get to our new home?</i>

1269
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,715
<i>The killer was just a college student</i>
<i>without any skills.</i>

1270
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:20,385
<i>I doubt he could do anything</i>
<i>like what a detective does.</i>

1271
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,429
<i>He had an informant.</i>

1272
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:26,058
<i>And they must've been close to Ai.</i>

1273
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,770
<i>The only person who knew</i>
<i>her hospital was the CEO.</i>

1274
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:34,107
<i>But would he do something like that</i>
<i>to his company's star?</i>

1275
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:35,692
<i>A colleague?</i>

1276
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,820
<i>No, the members of B Komachi</i>
<i>were never that close.</i>

1277
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,073
<i>And I've never seen Ai with a friend.</i>

1278
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,743
<i>It's a known fact</i>
<i>that Ai has no relatives.</i>

1279
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,953
<i>She didn't know</i>
<i>how to contact them either.</i>

1280
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,122
<i>Then that only leaves…</i>

1281
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,501
<i>our father.</i>

1282
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:56,004
<i>She was keeping it a secret</i>
<i>even from the CEO,</i>

1283
01:17:56,088 --> 01:18:00,967
<i>but from Ai's limited social life, there's</i>
<i>a high chance he's in the same industry.</i>

1284
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:07,307
<i>Since he and I are related by blood,</i>
<i>I can find him by DNA testing his hair.</i>

1285
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:13,146
<i>The culprit who put Ai to such a fate</i>
<i>is in the entertainment industry.</i>

1286
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:16,692
<i>I can't die yet.</i>

1287
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:22,739
<i>Not until I find him</i>
<i>and kill him with my own hands!</i>

1288
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:28,829
Director.

1289
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,580
Oh, Mature Baby.

1290
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,582
Uh…

1291
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:36,545
My condolences… I don't know what to say.

1292
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,213
Don't worry about that.

1293
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:39,631
Hm?

1294
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,967
I have a favor to ask you instead.

1295
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,385
What is it?

1296
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,470
Do you want to raise me?

1297
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:53,854
Hey.

1298
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,772
How much longer, Ruby?

1299
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,942
Jeez, just wait a second, Bro!

1300
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:01,945
This uniform is cute
but difficult to put on.

1301
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,406
But it sure is cute!

1302
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,075
Don't make us late on the first day.

1303
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:10,328
Isn't your skirt too short?

1304
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,248
Bro, you've always sounded
like an old geezer.

1305
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,375
Oh yeah!

1306
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,628
Mama, we'll be off now.

1307
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,095
<i>Thus, our prologue came to an end.</i>

1308
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:30,557
<i>And the curtain rises on a new act.</i>

1309
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:32,350
<i>And…</i>

1310
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:37,355
<i>I begin my tale of vengeance.</i>

1311
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,076
Is this recording?

1312
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:17,706
Okay! I thought it might be nice
to make something like this.

1313
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:33,763
When you're all grown up, I hope we can
watch this while drinking together.

1314
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:37,851
I doubt I'd still be an idol
at that age though.

1315
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:42,147
Oh, by that time,
maybe you two will be idols.

1316
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:45,317
You are my kids, so it's totally possible!

1317
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:49,863
Whatever you end up being,

1318
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,490
please grow up to be strong.

1319
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,953
That's my only wish as your mother.

1320
