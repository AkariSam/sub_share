1
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,638
<i>Well-kept silky hair.</i>

2
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,059
<i>A baby face that screams innocence.</i>

3
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,270
<i>Her innate airheaded personality.</i>

4
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,523
It's true…

5
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,484
According to my long experience
in following idols,

6
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,279
these types of girls gain popularity
from hardcore otakus like crazy!

7
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,532
Your perspective
and analysis are disturbing.

8
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,869
If she'll get popular, then great.
Why don't you try scouting her?

9
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,038
Well, you're right, but…

10
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:05,626
You know how Loli<i> senpai</i> and my
destinies are entwined?

11
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,544
You do?

12
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,548
I mean, doesn't she have
like a bad attitude toward me?

13
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,551
Isn't that because you keep saying
"baking soda"?

14
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,513
Anyhow, I'll message her to meet up,
so at least try talking to her.

15
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,183
If you still think you can't get along,
then you can forget it.

16
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,437
KANA ARIMA'S ACTING
STANDS OUT FROM THE REST

17
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,360
THE STALKER WAS CREEPY
BUT HE WAS SO GOOD-LOOKING

18
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,704
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU AFTER SCHOOL

19
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,125
<i>What could it be?</i>

20
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,546
<i>What does he need to talk</i>
<i>to me so urgently about?</i>

21
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,298
<i>Really?</i>

22
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,925
<i>Could it be about…</i>

23
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,010
<i>How troublesome…</i>

24
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,095
<i>Really?</i>

25
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,643
-Sorry for the wait.
-Finally.

26
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:05,769
What took you so long?

27
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,397
Huh? You can wait there forever.

28
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,483
Why is your little sister here too?

29
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,944
Because Ruby's the one
who needs to talk to you.

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,115
I regret bracing myself.

31
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,120
So, what is it? I'm busy unlike you,
so keep it under 20 seconds.

32
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,164
What a blatant attitude.

33
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,751
Bro, if I asked her to become an idol now,

34
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,129
that's like me saying that
she's as cute as an idol!

35
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,256
That really gets on my nerves!

36
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,091
What's this pride you have?

37
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,261
Don't you want to start
idol activities immediately?

38
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,180
Is this the time to be stubborn?

39
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,268
You're right. It's true.

40
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:48,979
Ms. Kana Arima.

41
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,107
Would you like to become an idol with me?

42
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,488
Idol? Why all of a sudden?

43
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,824
There's a project to make a new idol unit
at Ichigo Production.

44
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,410
And I'm looking for its members.

45
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,788
I heard you were a freelancer.

46
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,749
Well, to be frank,
this would be a recruitment.

47
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,712
Is this for real?

48
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,714
It's important and for real.

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,970
Give me a little time to think about it.

50
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,682
<i>No, there's no way.</i>

51
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:29,436
<i>If I begin working as an idol,</i>
<i>I'll lose the young actor type of jobs,</i>

52
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,940
<i>and my main work will become</i>
<i>the rapidly changing idol-type jobs.</i>

53
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,486
<i>If I don't become a hit idol,</i>
<i>I lose both jobs.</i>

54
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,406
<i>The risk is too high freelance-wise.</i>

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,157
<i>However…</i>

56
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,827
<i>Ruby Hoshino.</i>

57
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,954
<i>I don't know why,</i>

58
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,917
<i>but this girl bears some kind of</i>
<i>resemblance to the genius idol Ai.</i>

59
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,296
<i>I've only worked with Ai once,</i>

60
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,590
<i>but she was meant to become a real star.</i>

61
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:04,972
<i>My senses as an entertainer</i>
<i>sees potential in this girl.</i>

62
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:11,645
<i>But Ichigo Production isn't a major agency</i>
<i>and has no record of any new projects.</i>

63
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,525
<i>First of all, I'm not cute enough</i>
<i>to become popular as an idol.</i>

64
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,487
<i>I'm not that foolish</i>
<i>to take a wild gamble.</i>

65
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,822
-I'm sorry, but--
-Please.

66
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,073
Kana Arima.

67
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,452
Please become an idol with my sister.

68
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,164
But I'm not that cute--

69
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,206
No, you are cute.

70
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,461
I wouldn't ask you
to become an idol so lightly.

71
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,839
Arima, you're much cuter
than many of those idols out there.

72
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,176
If it's you, I can put my precious sister
under your care.

73
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,677
Uh, but…

74
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,804
Please, become an idol.

75
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,015
-I… I can't!
-Please.

76
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,516
I'm not doing it!

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,227
Arima, I'm asking you because I trust you.

78
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,481
Jeez! No matter how many times you ask,
no means no!

79
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,775
I won't ever do it!

80
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,902
KANA ARIMA

81
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,822
Welcome to Ichigo Production.
We're happy to have you onboard.

82
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:08,911
My brain knows I shouldn't!
So how do I always end up like this?!

83
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,121
Let's work together, <i>Senpai</i>!

84
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,374
I didn't think
you'd really bring her over.

85
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,168
What kind of method did you use?

86
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,629
Nothing special.
Just a personality reading.

87
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,591
Kana Arima is very sympathetic
and weak under pressure.

88
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,804
According to her personality, I thought
a sob story or over-pressuring would work,

89
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,263
and sure enough, it did.

90
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,640
You know…

91
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,894
If you keep doing that kind of stuff,
you're gonna get punished someday.

92
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,396
Be careful when you walk at night.

93
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,775
<i>I don't think I've done anything bad.</i>

94
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:40,859
You making fun of me?!

95
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,153
<i>It's not like I lied about anything.</i>

96
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,655
Well…

97
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,826
my meaningless title as an ex-genius
child actress has only changed

98
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,162
to an ex-genius
child actress idol, that's all.

99
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,707
Either way, I did need a boost
one way or another.

100
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,460
You're so desperate
to convince yourself of reality.

101
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,378
Besides,

102
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:04,424
if I join the same agency as him,
we'll be able to work together more.

103
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,427
There could be some kind of skill
I can learn from him.

104
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,512
Really?

105
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,474
Hey, doesn't Aqua have
any upcoming jobs or anything?

106
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,436
Umm, well, he does.

107
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,979
That's a bitter look…

108
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,022
This.

109
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,191
What?

110
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,444
Aqua's dating?!

111
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:29,366
WE'RE ABOUT TO FALL IN LOVE ♥ FOR REAL

112
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,872
A NEW SEASON KICKS OFF

113
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,001
THE START OF A FRESH SEASON OF LOVE

114
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,130
THE SIX PARTICIPATING MEMBERS
THIS TIME ARE…

115
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,591
Hello!

116
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,553
Um, I'm Yuki Sumi.
I'm a 1st year in high school.

117
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,054
<i>She has a nice style!</i>

118
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,432
<i>She looks good from head to toe.</i>

119
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,894
I'm Nobuyuki Kumano. I'm good at dancing.

120
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,772
NOBUYUKI KUMANO
DANCER - 2ND YEAR

121
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,318
I'm Akane Kurokawa,
a 2nd year in high school. I'm an actress.

122
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,944
<i>Ugh, there she is.</i>

123
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:06,904
<i>Oh, you know her?</i>

124
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,864
<i>Well, yeah…</i>

125
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,743
I'm Mem-cho, a 3rd year in high school.
I stream on YouTube!

126
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,328
Nice to meet you!

127
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,246
<i>So these types appear too, huh.</i>

128
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,789
<i>She's so cute!</i>

129
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,419
I'm Kengo Morimoto. I'm in a band.
Nice meeting everyone.

130
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,298
KENGO MORIMOTO
MUSICIAN - 3RD YEAR

131
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,842
Oh, what year are you?

132
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:29,885
Second year.

133
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,844
Third year.

134
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,763
I see.

135
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,849
So high schoolers who work in showbiz

136
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,102
deepen their relationships
through various events on weekends.

137
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,607
And you get to see who gets together
or not at the end of the show.

138
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,028
Since this is Producer Kaburagi's program,
everybody has a pretty face.

139
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,614
Oh, it's Bro.

140
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:55,619
I'm Aqua. I'm getting super nervous.
Everyone, nice to meet you!

141
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,579
Who the hell is that?!

142
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,666
Bro's usually the dark type
who emits a negative aura!

143
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,959
He's totally a poser!

144
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,503
Wow, so cool!

145
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,838
I admire actors!

146
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:11,593
Agh, my brother's hard on
these types of girls who act cutesy.

147
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,970
So this girl's out.

148
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,557
Mem-cho, you're cute too.
You're making me really blush.

149
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,016
Huh? Drop dead.

150
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,893
What's with him?!

151
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,981
He told me that I was cute
only when I was being recruited!

152
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,608
He's getting carried away
being surrounded by women.

153
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,277
I'll have to lecture him later.

154
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,946
So my brother's just a wolf after all.

155
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,782
This is what happens as soon
as men find some easy prey.

156
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,160
Calm down, you two. This is all for show.

157
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,998
If he doesn't act that way,
the show wouldn't hold up, right?

158
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:45,669
Though I understand seeing a familiar guy
flirting with other women is irritating.

159
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,130
Aqua is an actor too.

160
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:52,050
I'm sure he's probably there knowing
that he has to act out a guy like that.

161
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,010
Acting…

162
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,177
I know that, but…

163
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:59,516
Don't they actually ask each other out
and become couples at the end?

164
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,059
That's right.

165
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,521
Even if it's an act,
they'll have to go through with it.

166
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,899
If they do become a couple,
don't they kiss and stuff?

167
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,776
That's how it usually goes.

168
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,448
Why did he accept a show like this?

169
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,659
If you're going to continue
as an actress too,

170
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,621
scenes with kissing and the sort
will eventually be demanded.

171
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,415
You have to accept that
as part of the job.

172
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:28,712
If you keep prudish views in this field,
it's going to weigh you down later.

173
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,298
I know that, but…

174
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,676
-So, this is my dog!
-Uh-huh.

175
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,263
See? Cute, huh? Look!

176
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,057
Uh-huh, so cute.

177
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,267
<i>What a drag.</i>

178
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,772
<i>It's tough having these empty</i>
<i>conversations where all I can do is agree…</i>

179
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,732
<i>Why do I have to put up with this?</i>

180
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,401
If you go on this show for me,

181
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,946
I'll tell you a deep inside story
that Ai's agency doesn't even know.

182
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,159
That itself could be
about Ai's relationships with men.

183
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,371
<i>I'll just have to go through with it.</i>

184
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,123
<i>So I can get information about Ai</i>
<i>from Producer Kaburagi.</i>

185
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:10,087
<i>That should become a clue</i>
<i>to finding our father.</i>

186
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,673
<i>This is how the show flows</i>…

187
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,636
Uh, we don't mind if everyone talks
freely with each other.

188
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,598
However, just be careful
of the static camera angles please.

189
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,018
When the cameraman closes up,
if it's possible,

190
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:29,940
it would help us if you could recap
the conversation you were just having.

191
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:30,857
Okay!

192
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,819
<i>The history of reality dating shows have</i>
<i>reached 20 years,</i>

193
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,613
<i>so its know-how has been built up</i>
<i>to some degree.</i>

194
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,783
<i>While guaranteeing</i>
<i>its entertainment side of the program,</i>

195
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,328
<i>there are ways to stage reality</i>
<i>based on the individuals' personalities.</i>

196
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,957
Um, am I doing this okay?

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,960
Uh, I think that's fine at first.

198
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:55,966
Next time, if you can close the distance
a bit and chat, that would help.

199
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,135
Since the audience wants excitement too.

200
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,553
I see…

201
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,557
So these shows really don't have a script.

202
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,351
I don't know what to talk about at all.

203
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,519
I know!

204
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,480
<i>Reality shows don't have a script.</i>

205
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,316
<i>But the staging exists.</i>

206
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,446
<i>It's up to us to take the director's</i>
<i>words as advice or directions.</i>

207
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,742
I'm a scaredy cat and not aggressive.
Nor am I good at talking.

208
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,661
So I bet I'm just gonna fade out.

209
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,622
Why did you take on this job?

210
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:32,210
Our agency's star is the type
to never decline jobs.

211
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,882
That person takes all the jobs that
come in, so I'm bored all year round.

212
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,050
So I kind of wanted to fight my way out.

213
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,219
That's when Mr. Kaburagi…

214
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,179
Ah.

215
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,600
It was perfect since I never dated much
until now anyway.

216
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,601
Liar.

217
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,270
Hey, it's not a lie.

218
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,272
I'm still a 1st year in high school.

219
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,610
If you think we're all dating just because
we're an entertainer, you're wrong.

220
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,196
Don't you have any interest in dating?

221
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,616
Of course I do. I am a guy after all.

222
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,787
But, I can't get over an old crush…

223
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,667
No, come to think of it,
I don't even know if that was a crush.

224
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,546
I haven't fully gotten over it yet,
so I can't really say…

225
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,758
Hm? It's complicated?

226
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,094
Oh, like you had a crush on your teacher?

227
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,471
That's pretty close.

228
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,682
Then you'll need to overcome that.

229
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,392
Did you know?

230
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,605
<i>Last season's couple kissed at the end!</i>

231
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,608
<i>Yeah. I did do my research.</i>

232
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,237
I was worried
if there would be any good guys…

233
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,782
but I may be able to kiss if it's you.

234
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,783
Wha…

235
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,284
Behind me.

236
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,037
The cameraman's filming.

237
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,581
Don't look toward the camera.

238
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,960
This part will surely be used.

239
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,211
Let's get along.

240
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,925
<i>She's got a sly personality.</i>
<i>And she said she's a scaredy cat?</i>

241
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,763
<i>I see, so this is a reality show.</i>

242
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,853
I am your sister supposedly,

243
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,566
so I don't want my brother dating
a type of person that I don't like.

244
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:22,112
Which is why I am going to choose
who you should date.

245
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,864
How selfish can you be?

246
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:27,492
My recommendation is… Yuki-pon!

247
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,370
I'm sure this girl is
a good innocent girl!

248
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,667
You're a poor judge of character,
so don't date for a while.

249
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,877
Huh?!

250
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,548
Frill is absent again today.

251
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,260
She did say a shoot
for a new drama started,

252
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,887
so maybe she's busy?

253
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,054
Hm.

254
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,431
What about you, Minami?

255
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,683
I'm going to my shoot after school.

256
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,019
I see…

257
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,189
My brother's at his shoot today too.

258
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,526
<i>Senpai</i>, you're used to
not having work, right?

259
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,403
What do you usually do?

260
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,573
Do you want me to throw a jab
at your chin and shake your brain?

261
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,783
If you're bored, you should study.

262
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:13,038
Idols are short-term jobs you can barely
survive off of even if you do get popular.

263
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:17,792
Doing something to get into a good college
will benefit your life more.

264
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,544
That's brutally frank of you…

265
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,006
Isn't there something
I could do right now?

266
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,258
The work of new idols are

267
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,594
just singing and dancing at concert halls.

268
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,513
And sometimes accepting jobs
from the media, right?

269
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,559
We don't have any songs
or even a group name yet.

270
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,270
What's there for us to do right now?

271
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:42,025
We don't have a group name yet,
because you're the one griping about it!

272
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,028
Because it'll become real
if we come up with a name.

273
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,949
I haven't really made up my mind yet
to call myself an idol.

274
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,451
Why not? Idol Kana Arima.

275
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,661
How embarrassing!

276
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,621
A self-proclaimed idol
without any achievements…

277
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,790
How do I explain that to my parents?!

278
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,834
So if you have achieved something,
would you make up your mind?

279
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,587
Then let's achieve something.

280
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,924
What is this cheap camera?

281
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,093
Even if it's cheap, it's enough.

282
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,096
It was the norm for new idols

283
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:16,351
to pass out flyers or perform joint
concerts until a while ago.

284
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,478
But times have changed.

285
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,481
The center of idol culture
is now on the internet.

286
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,067
This is the most cost-efficient place
to take root.

287
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,279
Let's begin with spreading
your names on the internet.

288
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,031
You mean to become YouTubers?

289
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:34,703
Yup. If we make regular customers and call
them to concerts, isn't that efficient?

290
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,705
Mrs. Miyako's so smart!

291
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,542
CEO… aren't you
underestimating the internet?

292
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,753
Even if you upload this girl
with nothing but a good face,

293
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,214
we'll only hit a few thousand
subscribers at most.

294
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,257
Say what?

295
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,885
I don't know if we'll hit 10,000
even with my fans.

296
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:55,056
Since probably only 1% of that
will participate in a real event,

297
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,392
I think it'll be pretty tough.

298
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,728
That's if an amateur tried doing that.

299
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,565
But Ichigo Production's strength
lies within the internet,

300
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,275
we possess many streamers.

301
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,693
We have the know-how.

302
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:11,990
I just grabbed someone who can help you,
so go learn a lot from him.

303
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,451
Okay, I'll leave the rest to you!

304
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,411
Leave it to me!

305
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:19,831
It's…

306
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,542
a freak!

307
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,294
Oh, it's Pieyon!

308
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,503
What? Who?!

309
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,589
He's super popular among young kids!

310
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,092
You don't know
the masked fitness YouTuber, Pieyon?!

311
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,053
He's our top seller!

312
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,264
First of all, the "masked fitness" genre
is new to me!

313
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,184
I don't watch YouTube that much.

314
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,145
So this is what strikes
kids' interests nowadays.

315
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,856
We sure live in a distorted society.

316
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,733
How dare you talk like that to Pieyon…

317
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,819
Mr. Pieyon, tell her off!

318
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,697
The internet is just about
making strong impressions after all.

319
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,659
It's like a mascot business
reusing television schemes…

320
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,412
I make 100 million a year.

321
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,415
I apologize for my foolish words.

322
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,587
Listen well. There are several techniques
in order to gain subscribers.

323
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,922
What do you think they are?

324
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,131
Daily uploads!

325
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,883
Original popularity?

326
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,384
Uh-huh, right!

327
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:18,181
But you two don't have the guts to upload
daily or have original popularity, do you?

328
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,557
Brutal.

329
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,895
However, there's a shortcut
to gaining subscribers easily!

330
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,730
We've been waiting, Sensei!

331
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,273
Please tell us!

332
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,692
That is…

333
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:36,157
Peep, peep! The Pieyon Channel!

334
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,410
So today, we have a collaboration!

335
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,537
COLLABORATION

336
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,872
I guess there's an idol unit
at our agency now?

337
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,417
They're gonna start one,
so they told me to use them on my channel.

338
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,420
I thought of refusing at first!

339
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,381
But since the CEO insisted…

340
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,008
So let's begin our plan today!

341
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,140
<i>Aim for macho muscles!</i>

342
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,852
<i>Even if you peep, don't give up and fight!</i>

343
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,522
<i>Now flutter, muscles!</i>

344
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,276
<i>Break out of your shell, muscles!</i>

345
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,613
Pieyon Dance Bootcamp!

346
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:19,617
If they keep up with me for one hour,
they can show their faces!

347
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,125
<i>Everybody starts with chick muscles!</i>

348
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,090
<i>Be born, new muscles!</i>

349
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:38,636
<i>Before you start chirping, do it!</i>

350
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,681
<i>You can wear a mask today too! Peep, peep!</i>

351
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:46,227
<i>This world is survival of the fittest</i>
<i>So do it!</i>

352
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,855
<i>Power is strength!</i>
<i>Let's survive this tough industry!</i>

353
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:53,651
<i>Sit down, stretch out your legs</i>
<i>And lift your heels.</i>

354
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,569
<i>Keep this position</i>…

355
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,279
<i>This is tough!</i>

356
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,617
<i>Since he claims to be a fitness YouTuber,</i>
<i>he sure makes it tough!</i>

357
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,037
<i>He wants us to dance with this stupid</i>
<i>mask on? Is he trying to kill us?!</i>

358
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,747
The pose of the silent cicada!

359
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,664
<i>I need oxygen!</i>

360
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,583
The pose of the insomniac bear!

361
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,918
<i>Please think about oxygen!</i>

362
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,003
<i>Why did it turn out this way?</i>

363
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,964
The best way to advertise
is a collaboration after all.

364
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,468
To collaborate with a famous YouTuber
is the quickest way!

365
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:23,097
You'll appear on my channel this time,
but what should we do?

366
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:27,185
You two are idols after all,
so should we do like a wake-up prank?

367
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,187
Ah, that sounds good.

368
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,230
Huh? But…

369
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,442
If we're told about it beforehand,
it wouldn't be a prank, right?

370
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,904
Are you seriously saying that?

371
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:42,283
What if the crew went to film an idol
waking up and she was sleeping with a guy?

372
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,119
Those shows usually
notify the person the day before.

373
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,120
Really?!

374
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,041
But this is our very first job.

375
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,794
I don't want to lie.

376
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,047
<i>So it comes down to this?!</i>
<i>This is the extreme opposite!</i>

377
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,384
<i>I can tolerate this because I go jogging,</i>

378
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,928
<i>but for a complete amateur like her…</i>

379
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,306
This is tough!
It's so tough I'm gonna die!

380
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,811
The hatching pose!

381
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,408
Well done! You may take off your masks now
and introduce yourselves!

382
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,370
I belong to Ichigo Production,
I'm Ruby Hoshino.

383
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,872
I'm a self-proclaimed idol!

384
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,582
And you!

385
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,045
I'm Kana Arima,
a self-proclaimed idol! Hello!

386
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,922
Yes, yes, I've heard of the name.

387
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,549
Only "heard of"?

388
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,135
But well done.

389
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,638
I was going to edit it
to make it look like it was an hour,

390
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,473
but you two actually did it.

391
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,476
It's not something the audience will see.

392
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,937
But the people on set are always watching,

393
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,148
so I like you two.

394
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,819
Oh, I forgot to ask something important!

395
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,613
Do you two have a group name?

396
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,282
Uh…

397
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,746
Just choose whatever you want, Ruby.

398
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,830
You sure?

399
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,460
Um, then our group name is…

400
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,128
<i>B Komachi!</i>

401
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,423
<i>What? Is that okay to use?</i>

402
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,885
AFTER MAKING THE B KOMACHI IDOLS
DANCE FOR ONE HOUR…!!

403
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,815
