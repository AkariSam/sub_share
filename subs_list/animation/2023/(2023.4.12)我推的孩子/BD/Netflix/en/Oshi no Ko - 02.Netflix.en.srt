MEGUROGAWA MIDDLE SCHOOL

12
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,292
To be honest, I'm pretty confident!

13
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,881
I wasn't qualified to apply last time,
so I waited two years for this audition!

14
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,008
Yeah! I bet you passed for sure!

15
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,011
Since you're cute
and good at dancing too, Ruby!

16
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,973
-Though your singing is, you know.
-"You know"?

17
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:23,144
But you're appealing enough
to cover up that flaw, Ruby!

18
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,353
"Flaw"?

19
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,649
Anyhow, I'm definitely gonna pass
this idol audition!

20
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,779
<i>And one day,</i>
<i>I'll become a top idol like my mom.</i>

21
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,242
<i>My name is Ruby Hoshino.</i>

22
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,745
<i>I have two secrets</i>
<i>that I can't even tell my friends.</i>

23
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,918
<i>Over a decade ago, the legendary idol</i>
<i>who was murdered by a cult fan stalker,</i>

24
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,962
<i>Ai, was my mother.</i>

25
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,089
<i>And one more.</i>

26
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,634
<i>The fact that I have memories</i>
<i>of my previous life.</i>

27
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,307
<i>My body was weak since birth, so</i>
<i>I spent most of that life in a hospital.</i>

28
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,020
<i>The only fun I could have</i>
<i>was with idol otaku activities.</i>

29
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,231
<i>And I was especially obsessed</i>
<i>with Ai from B Komachi.</i>

30
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,861
<i>Even in the last hours of my life,</i>

31
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,989
<i>Ai's singing voice</i>
<i>was echoing inside my head.</i>

32
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,874
<i>But the next time I woke up,</i>
<i>I was reborn as Ai's child.</i>

33
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,918
<i>Ai…</i>

34
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:33,797
<i>Those couple of years until Mama died</i>
<i>are a treasure to me.</i>

35
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,426
I will become like Mama!

36
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:42,681
It's okay to dream, but high school
entrance exams are around the corner.

37
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,435
You don't get it, Bro.

38
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm gonna become an idol.

39
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,357
Schools with entertainment courses
prioritize interviews.

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,192
Academic skills are only for reference.

41
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:58,155
I don't have to study if I become an idol.
I can kill two birds with one stone!

42
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,408
Don't gamble your life away
with some tidbit you got somewhere.

43
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,873
You can dream of becoming an idol,
but being an idol is no glamorous dream.

44
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,086
Low pay is standard and
you'll have to retire before you're 30.

45
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,005
And your daily life will always
be under fan surveillance.

46
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,175
The industry survival rate's low
after idol graduation

47
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,136
and the majority shifts
to a different field in the end.

48
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,390
A job with the cost and benefit
being this mismatched is rare.

49
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,392
So what are you saying?

50
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,852
Life's about doing what you want!

51
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,522
If you worry about cost or benefit,
you can't do anything!

52
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,734
<i>There are people who end their lives</i>
<i>not being able to do anything!</i>

53
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,445
I don't want that!

54
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,198
Suit yourself.

55
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,534
I'm going to the director's place.

56
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,001
<i>My brother has changed since Mama died.</i>

57
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>He always has a glum face on</i>
<i>and never seems like he's having fun.</i>

58
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:01,844
<i>He's been up to something after</i>
<i>he began studying under the director,</i>

59
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,887
<i>but he won't tell me anything.</i>

60
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,517
<i>My brother isn't the only one who changed.</i>

61
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,938
<i>We lost contact with Mr. Ichigo</i>
<i>after that incident,</i>

62
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,065
<i>so Mrs. Miyako took over the business.</i>

63
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,696
<i>B Komachi, who lost their star Ai,</i>
<i>disbanded two years after.</i>

64
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,116
<i>The current Ichigo Production</i>
<i>has no idol division</i>

65
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,953
<i>so it extended its business to</i>
<i>managing internet personalities to get by.</i>

66
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,958
Hey, aren't you ever going to make
another idol group?

67
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,586
It's not as easy as you say.

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,468
If I could, I would.

69
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,725
The dream Ai showed us was
an unforgettable experience.

70
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,018
1ST PLACE
YEARLY RANKING

71
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,397
But we need to think of that
as winning the lottery.

72
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,610
The longer I do this job,
the more I can tell.

73
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,322
That kind of miracle won't happen again.

74
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,075
Things usually don't go
that smoothly in real life.

75
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,493
Besides…

76
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,703
Besides?

77
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:10,662
Uh.

78
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,667
Nothing. You should be getting your call
for your audition results soon.

79
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,254
If you pass, you've agreed
to join their agency, right?

80
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,465
They're a much proper agency than us.

81
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,635
Well, that is true, but…

82
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,386
AUDITION

83
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,264
Speak of the devil.

84
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,563
Yes?

85
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,109
<i>Am I speaking with Ms. Ruby Hoshino?</i>

86
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,027
Yes, this is Hoshino!

87
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,738
Yes.

88
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,949
Yes.

89
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,955
Oh, I see.

90
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,457
Thank you.

91
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,128
<i>Then we look forward</i>
<i>to your participation next time.</i>

92
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,552
Ruby.

93
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,892
I didn't make it.

94
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,899
That's reality.

95
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,569
There are all kinds of business politics,

96
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,864
so you can't expect your talent
to be fairly evaluated.

97
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,826
Not everyone can be like Ai.

98
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,828
GOTANDA STUDIO
GOTANDA

99
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,415
Thanks, Director.

100
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:49,011
You can even fool your own twin sister,
so you're pretty good as an actor.

101
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,557
What if the real agency calls her?

102
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:58,562
I sent a text message from Ruby's phone
to the agency saying she'll withdraw,

103
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,190
and I blocked their phone number as well.

104
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,733
I know what I'm doing.

105
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,194
I don't understand you.

106
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,947
Why go that far
to crush your sister's dream?

107
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,452
That girl's a real beauty,
she may actually have a chance.

108
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,621
No need to tell me.

109
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,207
But I won't let Ruby become an idol.

110
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,376
I won't let her make
the same mistake that Ai made.

111
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,669
Ever.

112
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,633
You and your sister complex.
You're overprotective.

113
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,636
<i>Just myself is enough.</i>

114
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,600
<i>I'll carry the plan out by myself.</i>

115
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,485
You were scouted?!

116
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,947
Yup! But it's for those
so-called underground idols!

117
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,866
I think this must be destiny!

118
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,787
I've been eyeing underground idol
hiring ads for a while!

119
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,790
You know how Mama became an idol
from being scouted too?

120
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,793
So, don't you think
I'm being led down this path?

121
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,420
Are you sure that's really an idol group?

122
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,381
Not some shady job?

123
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,299
It's nothing like that.

124
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,886
Did you check what's in their contract?

125
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,599
He said he'll show me their concert soon
and that we'd go over the contract after.

126
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,310
Huh.

127
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,313
I'm so excited!

128
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,151
Jeez, what a pain.

129
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,821
I gotta find some way to stop her.

130
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,281
There you go again.

131
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,200
Because of Ai's case,

132
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:39,746
I can understand how you don't want your
beloved sister to follow in her footsteps.

133
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,790
Even I…

134
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:48,714
still think about what it'd be like now
had I done something different back then.

135
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,466
I never want to feel like that again.

136
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,220
<i>I raised Ruby</i>
<i>like she was my own daughter.</i>

137
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,056
<i>I swore I would protect her.</i>

138
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:03,478
<i>But because she's my daughter, I can't</i>
<i>stop Ruby from pursuing her dreams.</i>

139
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,982
<i>She's starting to look</i>
<i>more and more like AI.</i>

140
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,943
<i>And unfortunately,</i>
<i>she does have potential.</i>

141
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,156
Either way,
she would've ended up this way.

142
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,118
Before we decide,
there's something I need to do.

143
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,164
I'm borrowing the agency's card.

144
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,081
What?

145
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,292
What are you going to do?

146
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,381
Hello!

147
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,343
Can I have a minute?

148
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,762
What is it?

149
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,222
I'm from here.

150
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,725
Oh, Ichigo Production?

151
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,143
You know us?

152
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,689
Yes, B Komachi's agency, right?
My mom was a fan!

153
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,650
Wow!

154
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,235
So this is Ichigo Production!

155
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,780
You're so young,

156
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,491
so I thought you were a recruiter
for a shady job.

157
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,203
<i>This feels like a shady nightmare.</i>

158
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:05,499
First off, I'm going to investigate
the group that Ruby was scouted to.

159
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,460
Since there's all sorts of
underground idols.

160
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,713
If they're a worthless management,
we won't even consider it.

161
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,467
We can talk about Ruby
becoming an idol or not after that.

162
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,222
Lala, you're currently working under
an agency called Yilibu, right?

163
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,556
Yes.

164
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,601
We'd like to offer you
a better set of conditions.

165
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,189
What kind of conditions
are you working under right now?

166
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,732
Um.

167
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:35,320
A small guaranteed minimum income
under the condition of doing all concerts.

168
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,406
And at the photo event after the concerts,

169
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,617
there's a commission based
on the number of photos taken.

170
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,160
That's our main income.

171
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,789
Then our outfit and various costs
are deducted from there.

172
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,251
Since transportation and makeup fees
are out of pocket too,

173
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,712
we don't make 100,000 yen
a month most of the time.

174
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:53,922
Hmm.

175
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,800
Any complaints about your current group?

176
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,760
Of course!

177
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:02,889
Management's pushing for this one girl,
but they over-favor her like crazy!

178
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,768
Why? Because apparently,
that girl's dating management.

179
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,019
<i>Oh jeez.</i>

180
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,023
It's not like she's good at singing.
Nor does she have a great face.

181
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:16,027
She steals other members' customers
by luring them to crush on her.

182
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,655
I'm doing this seriously,

183
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,741
but we can't become a hit
because of half-hearted management!

184
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,787
I feel nothing but bad vibes in the group,
and I sense some members quitting.

185
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,041
And I hear management
is scouting like crazy too.

186
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,544
If I can move to Ichigo Production…

187
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,051
There are underground idol management
that have experience,

188
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:44,681
but there are many idol lovers who do it
as an extension of their hobby too.

189
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,894
Of course, we don't know
if that girl's story was even true.

190
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,354
Jealousy and conflicts between members

191
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,609
and complaints toward management
producing false rumors are common.

192
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:02,491
First of all, managing a group
of young girls is extremely difficult.

193
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,534
Even with B Komachi,

194
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,496
Ai was the most popular,
so favoritism was…

195
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,749
Ugh, just the thought of it makes me sick.

196
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:16,755
Either way, we're not letting Ruby join
a group where rumors rise like that.

197
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,465
Then what are you going to do?

198
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,345
There's countless things. Like hire
a detective and expose them online…

199
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,347
Don't make jokes like that.

200
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,973
It isn't a joke.

201
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,353
I don't intend on letting Ruby
become an idol.

202
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,773
At least not under a management
that isn't trustworthy.

203
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,904
By the way,
how about we really hire that girl?

204
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,241
You know we don't manage idols anymore.

205
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:49,579
Besides, I don't want to hire someone
who talks badly about her group members.

206
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,501
Please excuse me for the day.

207
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,336
Goodnight.

208
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,775
Ta-da! Hey, what do you think?

209
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,277
You look cute.

210
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,531
You gotta dress up on your important days!

211
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,242
-Ah, I'm so excited!
-<i>She really does.</i>

212
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,203
Ruby, you're serious, huh?

213
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,165
Yeah.

214
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,130
You do know that the world
you're about to enter is a tough place?

215
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,925
You may feel miserable
for not becoming a hit idol.

216
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,261
It's not just the salary,
your private life--

217
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,848
I know! Aqua told me the same thing.

218
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,269
Even stalking is a common story
you'll hear about every day.

219
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:55,729
Despite that--

220
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,441
Of course! I mean, I can become one.

221
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,651
I can finally become an idol too.

222
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,654
I swear I'll become just like Mama!

223
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,242
You're serious?

224
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,744
I'm serious!

225
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,498
Then do not join that group.

226
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,209
What? Why?

227
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,463
I want to seriously become an idol--

228
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,841
If you're serious, then join our agency.

229
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,972
Ichigo Production will launch a new idol
group for the first time in over a decade.

230
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,730
Stamp your seal here on the binding.

231
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,398
Seal on the binding?

232
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,026
I don't really understand,
but I just stamp here?

233
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,569
EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT

234
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,487
HOSHINO

235
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,741
Okay, now you are an artist
belonging to Ichigo Production, Ruby.

236
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,494
If you do anything bad, I'll sue you.

237
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,620
That's super scary.

238
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,413
It's not a joke, okay?

239
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,504
This is also a necessary step
to enter the entertainment course,

240
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,089
so don't get mad, Aqua.

241
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,133
I'm not exactly against it.

242
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,304
GOTANDA STUDIO
GOTANDA

243
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,515
Aqua, welcome!

244
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,725
Is the director awake?

245
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,771
He's sleeping, but you can go ahead
and slap him awake.

246
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,898
Do you want to eat with us again?

247
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,608
No, don't mind me.

248
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,533
Oh, you're here.

249
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,284
Good morning.

250
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,162
Edit this, so it looks good.

251
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,288
Roger.

252
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,542
<i>I'm still a middle school student.</i>

253
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,795
<i>I'm not old enough for a job,</i>
<i>so I can't gain experience on set.</i>

254
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,757
<i>That's why I'm working</i>
<i>under the director as his pupil,</i>

255
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,385
<i>helping him with film production.</i>

256
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,846
I see.

257
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,349
So your sister's gonna go down
the path of an idol after all.

258
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,019
You're okay with it? As her brother?

259
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,231
Rather than having her become an idol
in some group from who-knows-where,

260
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,318
she'll be in safe hands
if her management is family.

261
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,488
Brother and sister both choose
the path of entertainment, huh?

262
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:14,325
Not both.
My goal is to work backstage now.

263
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,704
Weren't you gonna become an actor again?

264
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,206
You're applying to
your sister's school, right?

265
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,960
Only Ruby's taking the entertainment
course. I'm taking the general.

266
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,550
When you came to study under me,

267
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,511
you looked like
you definitely wanted to become an actor.

268
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:38,475
<i>For me, becoming an actor</i>
<i>is just a stepping stone.</i>

269
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,186
<i>To find the guy who put Ai to death.</i>

270
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,400
<i>To find my father to give him</i>
<i>a taste of the pain Ai went through.</i>

271
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:52,238
<i>Oddly enough,</i>
<i>the key to finding him is myself.</i>

272
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,743
<i>I should be able to identify him</i>
<i>through DNA testing his hair or saliva.</i>

273
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,287
<i>But in order to do that,</i>

274
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,874
<i>I need to get to a position where</i>
<i>I can interact with those in showbiz.</i>

275
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,461
<i>Becoming an actor</i>
<i>is the fastest way for that,</i>

276
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:10,840
<i>but if I just need to be in showbiz,</i>
<i>I can just work as an AD or backstage.</i>

277
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:18,807
Although they were minor roles, I can tell
after performing in a few of your works.

278
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,851
I don't have a talent for acting.

279
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,563
<i>I was just one of the many</i>
<i>struggling actors out there</i>

280
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,983
<i>who try hard but can't get anywhere.</i>

281
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,488
I don't have
a special skill of my own like Ai did.

282
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,033
I shouldn't aim for a goal
that's beyond my abilities.

283
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,538
If a kid doesn't dream, who will?

284
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:46,000
Even as a college student, it'd still be
too early to give up on your dreams.

285
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,919
Listen,

286
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,714
here's some advice from a middle-aged guy
chasing his dream for 20 years.

287
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,050
I'm only gonna say it once, so listen up.

288
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,680
Everyone has a right to dream.

289
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,265
Same with the lottery, you'll n--

290
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,892
Taishi! The food's ready!

291
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:07,355
M-Mom! I was giving a really nice talk,
so don't interrupt us!

292
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,607
How was I supposed to know that?!

293
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,569
If I waited,
the miso soup would've gotten cold!

294
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,321
I'll come over once we finish talking!

295
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,744
There was a time
when I was struggling just like you.

296
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,913
-Oh, my!
-But…

297
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,584
Look at all this mess here! Gosh!

298
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,127
Will you just hurry and go?!

299
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,590
Honestly, this child!

300
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,053
Hey, you're already in your mid-forties,
why don't you leave the nest soon?

301
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,515
There's no benefit to leaving
your parent's house if it's in the city!

302
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,853
There's actually a ton of guys like me!
It's typical in the creative field!

303
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,443
Anyway, you'll never win the lottery
if you don't buy a ticket. You need…

304
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,487
<i>The words of a man living in</i>
<i>his childhood room doesn't sink in.</i>

305
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,910
There was a time
when I believed I had talent like Ai.

306
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,454
But I couldn't become like Ai--

307
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,707
Ai this, Ai that!
Shut up, you sound like a pirate.

308
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:13,671
It's true Ai was incredible.
Maybe she really was a special person.

309
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:19,385
But you can never become Ai,
and Ai can never become you.

310
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,598
Did Ai ever have the filmmaking skills
like you have right now?

311
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,351
Did she have a brain like you?

312
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,732
Don't chicken out just from
being defeated one or two times.

313
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,819
Say that type of thing after you use
all the resources you have first.

314
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,406
It's way too early for you
to be acting like an average person.

315
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,033
You wanna be an actor, right?

316
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,993
It's written on your face.

317
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,248
<i>And maybe Aqua might be an actor?</i>

318
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,962
Hey, Director.

319
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,672
Hm?

320
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,132
I--

321
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:03,012
Aqua, you'll eat here, right?
I'll go and serve your rice already!

322
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,683
Mature Baby was just about to
say something good right now!

323
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,684
Don't come in!

324
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,852
How could I have known?!

325
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,694
<i>This is Youtou High School.</i>

326
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:22,740
<i>It's a six-year secondary school</i>
<i>with a rare entertainment course.</i>

327
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,119
<i>But not everybody can take this course.</i>

328
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,290
<i>A certificate proving you belong</i>
<i>to a talent agency is required.</i>

329
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,043
I'm Ruby Hoshino from Ichigo Production!

I'm Aquamarine Hoshino…

332
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,467
That's some name you have…

333
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,011
A standardized score of 70?!

334
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,680
Our school is recommended for
those who score around 40…

335
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,682
I was drawn to your spirit.

336
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,726
You were drawn
to our school spirit that much?!

How was it?

339
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,608
Probably okay. And you?

340
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,235
No problems.

341
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,363
If by some chance I don't get in,
it'd be because of my name.

342
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,493
That's true, your real name is
Aquamarine Hoshino after all.

343
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,288
Though everybody just shortens it
and calls you Aqua.

344
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,248
Aqua?

345
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,708
Hm?

346
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,131
Aqua Hoshino?!

347
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,924
Aqua! Aqua?

348
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,010
You're Aqua Hoshino?!

349
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,929
Who were you again?

350
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,639
Oh, isn't she that kid?

351
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,351
<i>The genius child actress</i>
<i>who licks baking soda.</i>

352
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,729
The genius child actress
who can cry in ten seconds!

353
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,899
We were cast in a film together!
I'm Kana Arima!

354
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,236
Ah, long time no see.
You were in the entertainment course here?

355
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,449
I'm so glad.
I thought you quit for the longest time.

356
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,951
I finally got to see you.

357
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,831
Are you taking
our entertainment course?! Are you?!

358
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,833
No, I applied for the general course.

359
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,585
Why?!

360
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:39,937
