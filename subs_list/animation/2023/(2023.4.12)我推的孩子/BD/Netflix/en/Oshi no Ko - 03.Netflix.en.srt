1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,384
<i>A recap of the previous episode.</i>

2
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,806
<i>After applying to this high school,</i>
<i>we met the genius child actress again.</i>

3
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,183
Are you taking our entertainment course?!

4
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,393
No, I applied for the general course.

5
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,853
Why?!

6
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,650
My sister applied for the entertainment
course, so I was worried and tagged along.

7
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,567
Huh?!

8
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,528
My brother has a sister complex.

9
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,570
Gross!

10
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,282
You know,
I've never really liked this girl.

11
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,952
But if you get in,
she's gonna be your senior.

12
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,620
Hmm, I see.

13
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,955
I can hear you two.

14
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,333
Aww, fine then.

15
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,002
Let's get along, Loli <i>senpai.</i>

16
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,295
I'll really bully you!

17
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,841
Then I'll be dropping by
the director's place.

18
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:12,758
Okay, bye.

19
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,009
Oh, wait!

20
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,472
Hey! I said hey!

21
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,352
Where are you going? Who's this director?!

22
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,898
Hey! Where do you live right now?

23
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,609
You listening?! I said hey!

24
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,404
What middle school you from?!

25
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,030
Are you a <i>yankii</i> girl?

26
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,825
How long are you gonna follow me?

27
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,369
Until you answer all of my questions.

28
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,330
You're still an actor, right?

29
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,253
No, not anymore.

30
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,091
I-I see…

31
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,218
So that's that.

32
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,429
Let's chat a little!

33
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,390
Hey! You wanna go to karaoke or something?

34
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,142
No way.

35
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:07,605
Oh. Then… maybe my place?

36
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,107
Isn't that closing the distance too fast?

37
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,029
I can't help it!
I am still a celebrity after all!

38
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,490
I can't just sit down at a café to chat.

39
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,161
There are no stores
with private rooms open at this time yet!

40
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,915
Oh, that's what you meant.

41
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,917
If that's the case…

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,127
Oh, Kana Arima!

43
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,088
Haven't seen you in a while,
but you've grown!

44
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,798
Uh, well…

45
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,259
I am still working…

46
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:40,721
Compared to when I was a child actress,
I'm not as… you know, but…

47
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,765
Well, make yourself at home!

48
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,061
I see.

49
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,396
Hey, Aqua.

50
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,234
If you're not an actor anymore,
why are you visiting the director's place?

51
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,861
You sure you're not really
studying acting?

52
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,656
Well, I was taught everything,

53
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,992
but now, I'm like the director's assistant
aiming for backstage.

54
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,702
Really.

55
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,330
But I'm glad.

56
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,209
You were still in this industry.

57
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,759
Do you want seconds?!

58
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,346
Uh, I'm fine. I'm cutting down on sugars.

59
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,765
If you don't eat, you won't grow!

60
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,767
-You eat this.
-What?!

61
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:28,936
Jeez.

62
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,312
But what a shock.

63
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,230
Huh?

64
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:35,276
Director, I didn't know
you were still leeching off your parents.

65
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:40,406
You're still the same brat
that never respects your elders.

66
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,242
But it's nice.

67
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,746
My parents moved back to the countryside,
so I live in a dorm alone.

68
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,916
So, I usually depend on Uber for meals.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,001
Really.

70
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,836
That must be expensive.

71
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,088
I'm fine!

72
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,217
Since at least my savings is loaded
from when I worked as a child star!

73
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,052
I freaking hate you.

74
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,558
Hey, Director.
Don't you have any videos of Aqua acting?

75
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,768
Umm, I do, but…

76
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:10,686
Don't show it.

77
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,939
I was just delusional
and it's an embarrassing past.

78
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:18,235
I mistook myself for having talent
and made a fool of myself.

79
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,486
You heard him.

80
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,407
So if you wanna see, you gotta
talk this guy into acting yourself.

81
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,950
Is that how you wanna do it?

82
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,660
I'm not doing it.

83
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,248
Right now,
I'm cast as the heroine in this one title,

84
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,084
but there's a role that's still open.

85
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,087
You want me to talk with the higher-ups?

86
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,631
Nope.

87
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:40,924
What?!

88
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,511
What's the title called?

89
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,639
A drama based on a <i>shoujo</i> manga
called <i>Mild Flavor Today.</i>

90
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,683
I see.

91
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:50,601
<i>Mild Today</i>?

92
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,936
Yeah, you know it?

93
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,399
Anyone who's studied staging that
doesn't know it must live under a rock.

94
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,525
It's a masterpiece.

95
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,737
So you're interested?

96
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,032
I told you I don't act anymore.

97
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:09,286
If I talk to them,
it might smoothly go through.

98
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,873
Since the producer,
Mr. Kaburagi, likes me!

99
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,500
Kaburagi?

100
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,087
Is his full name Masaya Kaburagi?

101
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,421
That's right.

102
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,845
<i>There are three cell phones</i>
<i>Ai left behind.</i>

103
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,808
<i>Two of them were for work and private use</i>

104
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,186
<i>and only had records of</i>
<i>other group members and agency staff.</i>

105
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,774
<i>Ai seemed careless, but she was</i>
<i>much more careful than I imagined.</i>

106
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,486
<i>I learned that she was</i>
<i>seriously trying to hide our secret.</i>

107
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,198
<i>The problem is the other cell phone.</i>

108
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,952
<i>This one was used by Ai</i>
<i>before she got pregnant.</i>

109
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,663
<i>It was several generations old,</i>

110
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,166
<i>so it was backbreaking to find</i>
<i>a replacement for the dead battery.</i>

111
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>But that was nothing compared to</i>
<i>bypassing the passcode.</i>

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,426
<i>It's unusable for 30 seconds</i>
<i>if I get the passcode wrong</i>

113
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,804
<i>and I don't even know</i>
<i>how many digits it is.</i>

114
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,808
<i>It took me half a day</i>
<i>to try 100 passcodes.</i>

115
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,270
<i>It took me a month for 1,000 attempts.</i>

116
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,980
<i>Day after day…</i>

117
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,440
<i>Day after day…</i>

118
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,650
<i>Day after day…</i>

119
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,612
<i>On the 45,510th attempt</i>…

120
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,864
ENTER YOUR PASSCODE

121
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:33,620
<i>I finally reached the passcode</i>
<i>after four years had passed.</i>

122
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,664
<i>On that phone,</i>

123
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,585
<i>there were emails and numbers</i>
<i>of a dozen of those affiliated in showbiz.</i>

124
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,837
<i>And one of them was…</i>

125
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,467
Masaya Kaburagi…

126
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:47,968
Hey, let's try it!

127
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,762
Most of the cast are close to our age too.

128
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,850
The main boy has a girly face,
so he's really cute!

129
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,435
-I'll do it.
-What?

130
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,188
Call the producer for me.

131
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,315
Why do you all of a sudden…

132
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,942
Wait, no way…

133
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:08,864
The main boy has a girly face,
so he's really cute!

134
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,158
Don't tell me you're…

135
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,285
Let's do it.

136
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,833
I can't wait to see Aqua's acting.

137
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,422
Oh, but this set has some problems,
so be prepared, okay?

138
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,423
Hm?

139
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,341
FROM TOKYO

140
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,926
He was a child actor?

141
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,469
<i>Yes!</i>

142
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,428
Hmm.

143
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,556
He's got a pretty face.

144
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:40,395
If you with your strong acting skills
speak so highly of him, bring him in.

145
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,607
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

146
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,943
Is it settled?

147
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,653
Huh? Yeah.

148
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,657
Well, I don't care
who takes the role anyway.

149
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,783
MASAYA KABURAGI

150
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,036
What? Aqua, you're gonna be in a drama?!

151
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,205
Why did you tell her?

152
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,375
Because you would
never say anything yourself.

153
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,128
It's the agency's job to promote
the activities of registered artists.

154
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,465
Mama did say…

155
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:14,596
that my future might be an idol
and Aqua might be a future actor.

156
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,184
So you never forgot those words.

157
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,188
<i>It's not like that.</i>

158
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,945
<i>If I can meet the producer Ai had</i>
<i>interacted with when she was alive</i>

159
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,823
<i>and retrieve the root of his hair,</i>
<i>that'll be all I need.</i>

160
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,287
<i>I'm not thinking of doing anything great</i>
<i>like fulfilling Ai's wishes</i>

161
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,872
<i>or dreaming of becoming an actor.</i>

162
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,292
What's the title of the show?

163
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,212
The title is <i>Mild Flavor Today</i>.
It's based on a <i>shoujo</i> manga.

164
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,923
Oh! I know it! <i>Mild Today</i>!

165
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,677
It's the one in Aqua's room!
It was interesting!

166
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,220
Don't read it without asking.

167
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:58,307
It's a drama by a recently established
streaming platform.

168
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,269
Three episodes
have already been released out of six.

169
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,855
There are many new faces in the main cast.

170
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,316
It's a rather small-scale series.

171
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:12,237
Looks like Aqua's role is the bad guy
in the last episode.

172
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,032
That's perfect. You do have an evil face.

173
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,199
Shut up.

174
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,786
It's a streaming platform's drama,
so we can watch it right now.

175
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,704
I wanna watch!

176
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,878
I hate humans.

177
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,382
Because everyone only thinks
about themselves.

178
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,384
Oh, it's Loli <i>senpai!</i>

179
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,345
You know,

180
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,057
are you even having fun
with a face like that?

181
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,391
<i>What do you want?</i>

182
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:46,104
<i>Nothing. I just chased after a cat</i>
<i>and found you here.</i>

183
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,272
<i>What the heck?</i>

184
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,609
Hey, you look cute when you smile.

185
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,778
W-What? Don't tease me!

186
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,821
<i>Be honest with yourself.</i>

187
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:55,781
<i>Hey, you!</i>

188
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,866
Don't touch my girl!

189
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,035
Huh? Who the heck are you?

190
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,788
Please stop, you two!

191
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,915
<i>Don't fight!</i>

192
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,378
Was <i>Mild Today</i>'s<i> </i>story like this?!

193
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,881
For the most part, wasn't it?

194
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:17,010
The staging is good,
so it's not impossible to watch,

195
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:20,472
but there's these characters
that were never in the original story.

196
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,976
It's probably the production's direction
to use as many actors as possible.

197
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,353
Uh.

198
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,523
The flow of events
wasn't like this either, right?

199
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,402
When you cram 14 volumes
of manga into half a season,

200
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:37,030
some scenes have to be cut out.

201
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,782
The acting is also…

202
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,910
Looks like
many inexperienced actors are in it.

203
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,497
I don't know, but this is awful!

204
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,499
You're being too straightforward.

205
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,711
I mean, wasn't Loli <i>senpai</i>
better at acting too?

206
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,383
KARAOKE CAN

207
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,885
Shut up! She said something like that?!

208
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,262
I hope she drops dead!

209
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,265
Your foul mouth sure hasn't changed.

210
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,642
I'll say this for my reputation's sake,

211
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,854
but there aren't that many high schoolers
who can act like me!

212
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,565
Then why did the show turn out like that?

213
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,654
This drama's plan is to cast as many
up-and-coming models as possible

214
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,366
<i>so that it reaches</i>
<i>the female audience who likes pretty boys.</i>

215
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,493
<i>Acting skills aren't a priority.</i>

216
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,455
<i>But the title will be destroyed like that,</i>

217
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:31,042
<i>so that's why they're using me,</i>
<i>who's known for acting, as the heroine.</i>

218
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,171
Considering that,
wasn't your acting pretty weak?

219
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,298
Obviously, I'm holding back!

220
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,676
The rest of the cast members are
all just cheesy actors!

221
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,970
<i>Nice nails.</i>

222
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,890
<i>People become stronger with people.</i>

223
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,184
<i>Smile for me.</i>

224
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,937
I'm the only one who can properly act
in the main cast, you know?!

225
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,316
What if I put on my best performance
in this group?

226
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,695
That'll just highlight the other actors'
cheesiness and it'll become a cheese fest!

227
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,779
Cheese fest?

228
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,824
I want to go all out and act too.

229
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,703
Who would want to go out of their way
to give a poor performance?

230
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:13,793
But, good performance
and creating good work are different.

231
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:19,466
It's true the seller's business scheme
stands out too much in this work.

232
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,260
There's no way this can
become an interesting piece.

233
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:26,515
<i>When the author of the original story</i>
<i>came to the first episode's set…</i>

234
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,229
her look of disappointment
really hit me hard.

235
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:37,400
<i>But the cast and crew are</i>
<i>each doing the best they can.</i>

236
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,155
<i>For the viewers and manga fans,</i>
<i>I want to make this as good as I can.</i>

237
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,908
At least I'll make it worthy of watching.

238
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,285
If it's for that, I'll even act poorly.

239
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,664
Even if that means
hurting your reputation as an actor?

240
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,667
What's important as an actor
is communication.

241
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,672
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>I used to flaunt my acting skills.</i>

242
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,633
<i>I was certainly popular,</i>
<i>but I never respected others.</i>

243
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,388
<i>That's why, once I had peaked,</i>
<i>jobs disappeared in an instant.</i>

244
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:12,519
"A reason to use me
over children with better acting skills."

245
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,896
I realized that's what's important.

246
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,692
In fact, I'm a flexible actress now,

247
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,279
who's never stubborn, and works hard
to raise the quality of work.

248
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,866
Producer Kaburagi and I go way back.

249
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:30,370
He appointed me this time too,
because I'm aware of those things.

250
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,207
Since when did you learn
to be so cooperative?

251
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,710
I am an adult now.

252
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:41,131
Well, I'm sure it helps having this
great face that can rival that of models!

253
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,717
Actors really have nothing
but self-confidence.

254
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,721
And so, the filming is tomorrow!
It'll be released next week!

255
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,223
It'll be rapidly edited
and rapidly delivered!

256
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,602
We'll skip the read-through,
rapidly rehearse, and rapidly film!

257
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,562
The schedule is done for too.

258
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:00,317
The boy of your role griped and quit, so
we had to reschedule. It was a disaster.

259
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,694
Especially because it's not a great role.

260
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,031
But that's also why
I was able to squeeze you in.

261
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,284
Using connections
and skipping the read-through.

262
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,994
The same process again.

263
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,457
<i>When we were kids, you told me off</i>
<i>when I did the same before.</i>

264
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,667
<i>Ah, good memories.</i>

265
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,670
I never thought
I'd be the one doing it now.

266
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,673
What a dirty grown-up I've become!

267
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,550
Quit laughing.

268
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,556
But I can understand
how the director felt now.

269
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,312
You understand why I recruited you, right?

270
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:42,317
I don't care how much shit anyone gives us
or if they call us cheesy actors.

271
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,655
Please, let's make this
a great title together.

272
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,908
If it's with you, I believe we can do it.

273
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,249
<i>A poorly planned project</i>
<i>with a cast that can't act.</i>

274
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,087
<i>But after hearing her story</i>
<i>and watching it over,</i>

275
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,465
<i>I can tell that the script</i>
<i>and staging are adjusted to the cast.</i>

276
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,509
<i>Even with bad acting,</i>

277
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,721
<i>you can tell there are many techniques</i>
<i>used to make it into something watchable.</i>

278
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,182
<i>The crew is good.</i>

279
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,394
<i>And the heroine has genuine talent.</i>

280
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,524
This may work somehow.

281
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,033
TV dramas usually have read-throughs
and rehearsals indoors with the main cast,

282
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:35,120
and the director lays out
the storyboard off of that.

283
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,373
Normally, it's a dry run
or camera rehearsal,

284
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,626
then a run-through,
and then filming takes place on set.

285
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,714
But this location could only be secured
for one day,

286
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,676
so the dry run to the run-through
will be treated as one rehearsal.

287
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,594
Practice is done only once.

288
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,307
What a mess. Even my director
is a little more organized.

289
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,476
There's no budget or time.

290
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,311
-Yo, Kana.
-Hm?

291
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,272
Isn't this rain awful?

292
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,233
I wanted them to postpone the shoot.

293
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,237
There is a bit of leakage,
but it'll be fine.

294
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,991
When it's humid, my hair gets frizzy.

295
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,201
This place is so muggy and unpleasant too.

296
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,249
Oh, let me introduce you.
This boy here is today's stalker role…

297
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,167
I'm Aqua.

298
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,960
-Nice to meet…
-Hi.

299
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,132
He's got a bad attitude.
I didn't even get his name.

300
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,801
He's the lead actor, Melt Narushima.

301
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,887
Well, he's young too,

302
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,307
and that's common for someone
who rose to fame smoothly.

303
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,642
Although, I'm not one to talk…

304
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,980
Certain idol group agencies
have proper training for artists,

305
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:48,860
so they're well-mannered, liked on set,
and you can't go wrong with them.

306
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,156
There's a good reason why
they're always being cast.

307
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,952
And so, greetings are
an important duty. Go on!

308
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,918
Nice to meet you.

309
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,464
I'm Aqua from Ichigo Production.
I look forward to working with you today.

310
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,509
Yeah, nice to meet you.

311
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,223
<i>Masaya Kaburagi.</i>

312
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,892
<i>The man who was affiliated</i>
<i>with Ai Hoshino somehow.</i>

313
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,687
<i>The one who could be</i>
<i>me and Ruby's biological father</i>

314
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,899
<i>as well as</i>
<i>the person involved in Ai's death.</i>

315
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:33,154
<i>I need to find a chance to retrieve</i>
<i>something that I can send for DNA testing.</i>

316
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,907
That person just now is
in charge of this set.

317
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:41,121
His thoughts are passed on to the director
and then they get conveyed on set.

318
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,623
He has strong connections
with model agencies,

319
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,167
so this casting was mostly decided by him.

320
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:51,881
Anyway, he's obsessed with pretty faces,
so that's probably why he chose you too.

321
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,217
We're starting the rehearsal!

322
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,429
Let's do this. You got the script down
in your head, right?

323
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,893
<i>My role is the stalker</i>
<i>who stalks the heroine.</i>

324
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,354
<i>How ironic is this?</i>

325
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,067
<i>Since I'm gonna be playing a stalker</i>
<i>just like the one who killed Ai.</i>

326
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,280
Ready, action!

327
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,681
We'll stop temporarily.

328
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,061
There's a bit of a leak here.

329
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:50,815
Then for this shot, let's increase
the dolly speed and go to the next one.

330
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,776
You can act properly.

331
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,237
And you said
you were aiming for backstage?

332
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,365
Anyone can do this much if they practice.

333
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,368
I'm just good enough
to not inconvenience others,

334
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,121
but there's nothing appealing about me.

335
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,250
<i>The acting Kana Arima saw that day</i>

336
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:13,171
<i>was just an abnormality caused by</i>
<i>the contrast between my age and body.</i>

337
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:17,008
<i>Now that my body has caught up</i>
<i>to my mental age,</i>

338
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,427
<i>I'm just an average actor found anywhere.</i>

339
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,765
If you were expecting
some kind of spectacular acting, sorry.

340
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:24,682
I was never…

341
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,978
Well, it'd be a lie
if I said I wasn't expecting anything.

342
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,772
But it's enough.

343
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:35,860
Your acting is like that of a person
who's been practicing for a long time.

344
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,028
I like it.

345
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,324
Your detailed techniques
are thoughtful and careful.

346
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,536
It's like you're holding back your ego
and adhering to the story.

347
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,624
Maybe that's something unnoticeable
to the average person,

348
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:54,504
and aside from longtime actors like us,
it might not matter to everyone else.

349
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,756
Don't be so caring.

350
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,634
I have to be.
I am the leader here after all!

351
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:05,974
A lead role is a big job I haven't had
in a decade, so of course I'll work hard!

352
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:10,603
That's true, I haven't seen you lately,
so I was surprised you were still acting.

353
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,688
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU LATELY

354
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,149
The days of my dark ages were long.

355
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,862
<i>I couldn't get work for so long that</i>
<i>my career was considered dead online.</i>

356
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,824
<i>But I always continued my acting lessons.</i>

357
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,577
I didn't know
what I was working for anymore.

358
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,622
And the word "retire"
crossed my mind so many times.

359
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,749
But!

360
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,129
The time when my skills are acknowledged
has finally come!

361
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,257
I thought, "I'm really glad I continued!"

362
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:44,053
That's why, even if you didn't give
a spectacular performance,

363
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:48,349
I was just glad to know
you continued in this industry.

364
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,395
Just knowing the fact
that there was someone else struggling

365
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,356
in this dark unforeseeable world with me.

366
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,109
That's enough for me.

367
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,950
Can we resume the shoot?

368
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,329
Melt has a magazine photo shoot
after this.

369
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,288
Almost.

370
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,750
Ms. Arima is keeping the cast busy, so…

371
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,714
Kana, she's really convenient.

372
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:25,887
She'll butter up anyone nicely,
so it's perfect to keep her around.

373
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,017
The name "Kana Arima"
is known to the public after all.

374
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,227
She left her agency becoming a freelancer,

375
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,355
so I can use her brand value
for close to no cost too.

376
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,274
What a bargain.

377
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,783
Well, just the part where she's fussy
about acting is a pain though.

378
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,786
<i>This drama is only promotional material.</i>

379
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,539
Acting skills aren't being demanded.

380
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,417
Seems like she doesn't understand that.

381
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,344
<i>The time when my skills are acknowledged</i>
<i>has finally come!</i>

382
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,640
You aren't being acknowledged.

383
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,102
<i>That's reality for you, Kana Arima.</i>

384
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,940
<i>It's more rare</i>
<i>to be properly acknowledged.</i>

385
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,779
<i>I've got the sample,</i>
<i>so my mission's complete.</i>

386
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,364
<i>But…</i>

387
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,741
We'll resume the shoot now!

388
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,957
Since I am here,

389
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,918
I'll have some fun before I go home.

390
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,889
