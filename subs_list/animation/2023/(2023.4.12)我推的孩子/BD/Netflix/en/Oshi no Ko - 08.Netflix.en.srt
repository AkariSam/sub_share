1
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,930
<i>It is said that Theater Lalalai</i>
<i>only possesses first-rate actors.</i>

2
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:39,892
<i>Akane Kurokawa is their young ace.</i>

3
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,144
A great transformative actress.

4
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,564
She studies her given role
and gains deep insight for it.

5
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:50,111
<i>And she has the innate ability</i>
<i>to perfectly play out that part.</i>

6
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,490
<i>Her personality wasn't fitting</i>
<i>for reality shows,</i>

7
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:59,203
<i>but as an actress, you can't describe her</i>
<i>as anything but a genius.</i>

8
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,664
A-Akane?

9
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,374
What's wrong, Aqua?

10
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,876
You look like you've just seen a ghost.

11
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,128
Nothing.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,548
Akane, welcome back!

13
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,758
You guys, sorry for the wait.

14
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,386
Seriously! We were waiting for so long!

15
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,804
Let's all have fun like before!

16
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,721
Yeah!

17
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,934
We're glad you seem well,
but are you okay now?

18
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,894
Huh? About what?

19
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,730
"About what?" That's--

20
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:30,651
Ah, since I got roasted pretty badly!

21
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:35,030
I did think that I screwed up,
but I'm sure that's pretty common!

22
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,783
Akane, your image kind of changed.

23
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,494
Yuki, you don't like me this way?

24
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,667
Aqua, let's spend time together today.

25
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,419
Okay.

26
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,590
<i>She stole the spotlight in an instant.</i>

27
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,799
<i>The cast.</i>

28
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,009
<i>The staff.</i>

29
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:56,969
<i>And even the cameramen.</i>

30
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,681
<i>Their eyes could not resist</i>
<i>the mysterious gravity that she held.</i>

31
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,726
<i>The charisma that Ai had…</i>

32
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,520
<i>Akane had it too.</i>

33
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,318
I heard about that video.

34
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,405
You pulled many all-nighters to make it.

35
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,781
That made me happy.

36
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,783
Thank you, Aqua.

37
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,868
Sure.

38
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:27,333
We know that Akane's acting a bit strange,
but isn't Aqua acting strange too?

39
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,417
Hmm?

40
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,960
Let's check.

41
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:33,213
Hey Aqua, will you pass me
that pouch there?

42
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,925
I'm thinking right now. Get it yourself.

43
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,636
Why not? Just give it to her.

44
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,720
Okay.

45
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:42,806
Here.

46
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,518
See?! He only listens to Akane!

47
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,855
So Aqua seriously likes that type.

48
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,816
Akane made sure to perfect her role.

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,984
It's not like that.

50
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,779
Here, you like her?

51
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,490
You like Akane like this?

52
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:02,910
Cut it out.

53
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,789
Hmm?

54
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,873
I'm telling you…

55
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,875
Seriously, cut it out…

56
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,335
Um, your response…

57
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,920
You're serious.

58
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,093
Akane, what are you gonna do?!

59
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,053
This could seriously be serious?!

60
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,805
What are you gonna do?!

61
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,891
W-What should I do?

62
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,769
Oh, she's back to her usual self!

63
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,189
Wait, if he makes a serious move on you,
are you gonna respond seriously?

64
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,233
Is there a chance you two might go out?

65
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,361
If I had to say "yes" or "no,"

66
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:38,821
yes.

67
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,701
Then you gotta make a move on him
like that even off-camera!

68
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,119
-Seriously?!
-Seriously?!

69
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,247
This is getting interesting!

70
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,748
This is not interesting.

71
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,875
I'm tired of it already.

72
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,585
I'm done watching this.

73
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,465
First off, the concept
of enjoying other people's romance

74
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,592
from a safe distance is in bad taste.

75
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,220
What's so great about pairing up
who and who?

76
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,515
What are you? A horse breeder?
You want them to produce a racehorse?

77
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,059
No way, I'm not watching it anymore.

78
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,894
I don't even wanna see Aqua's face.

79
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,105
Bye-bye, <i>sayonara</i>!

80
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,278
Mama…

81
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:26,243
<i>In my childhood,</i>
<i>I spent several years with Ai,</i>

82
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:30,789
<i>but I don't think I was able to learn</i>
<i>anything about her in the end.</i>

83
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,043
<i>I couldn't understand</i>
<i>a single thing about her.</i>

84
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,130
<i>How much was a lie and how much was true?</i>

85
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:44,553
<i>What is Ai to me?</i>
<i>Was I her fan? Was she my mother?</i>

86
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,513
<i>Or…</i>

87
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,781
I thought the Yuki-Yuki pair was hot,
but isn't the recent Aqua-Akane pair too?!

88
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,950
After Akane returned,
she's kind of more stylish.

89
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,243
She seems cute, right?

90
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,830
She and Aqua have kind of a bond
from overcoming trouble together.

91
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,374
Aqua's super conscious of her now!

92
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,709
So cute!

93
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,878
It's almost the last episode…

94
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,673
I wish we could see more!
Just when it started getting interesting!

95
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,635
The last season had
a kissing scene at the end.

96
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,179
Right?! I can't wait!

97
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,267
Arima.

98
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,728
Kana Arima.

99
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,398
Hey, you wanna ditch school
and hang out today?

100
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,277
Yeah.

101
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,074
Seriously, this can't be right!

102
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,244
Ditching school to hang out?
We're seriously delinquents!

103
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,663
No way! This is seriously the worst!

104
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,123
Seriously, the worst!

105
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,083
If you're gonna complain, you wanna stop?

106
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,584
I never said that.

107
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,963
Your face told me
that you had something on your mind,

108
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,424
so I thought I'd be a good <i>senpai</i>
and take care of you.

109
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,593
I'm such an angel, aren't I?

110
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,804
So, where are we going?

111
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,973
Disneyland? Tokyo Tower?

112
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:15,102
You have guts to suggest going
to places like that when ditching school.

113
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,064
Well, if we ditch in uniforms,
we'll get stared at!

114
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,233
But we'll lose time
if we go home to change!

115
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,779
And there are lots of people there
in uniform, so I thought it'd be perfect!

116
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,031
It doesn't have to be something like that.

117
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,450
Hm?

118
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,541
I knew you were weird.

119
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,251
-Really?
-Really!

120
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:44,715
A young boy and girl escape from a prison
called school and what do they do?

121
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,259
Play catch at a park peacefully.

122
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,803
You even went to buy a glove and ball.

123
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:50,721
So weird.

124
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,556
Hurry up and throw.

125
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,770
I've never even played baseba… Oh.

126
00:07:58,854 --> 00:07:59,938
Sorry!

127
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:00,981
Don't worry.

128
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:08,697
Instead of a beginner like me, maybe
you should've invited someone better.

129
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,199
Like Ruby…

130
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,285
What kind of a big brother
would let his sister ditch?

131
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,870
Your sister complex is gross.

132
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,874
Then someone from <i>Love For Real.</i>
You're close with them, aren't you?

133
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,877
Well, we're not on bad terms.

134
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,548
But they're still a part of work.
It's not like a casual relationship.

135
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,799
Is that so.

136
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:31,303
Most people lie
or mainly act based on calculation,

137
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:36,517
so there aren't many I can talk with
who don't have an ulterior motive.

138
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:38,769
Whoa!

139
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,856
But I don't have to worry about that
if I'm with you, Arima.

140
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,274
Well, you should!

141
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,277
Hmm, but well,

142
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:51,657
if you chose me to be that person for you,
I guess it's not too bad a thing.

143
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,994
Is <i>Love For Real</i>'s filming
almost finished?

144
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:56,912
Yeah.

145
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,832
Is Yuki the most popular?

146
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:05,546
But Akane Kurokawa seems
like she's doing good lately too.

147
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,846
In fact, who are you targeting?

148
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,851
It's merely work,
so I don't have something like that.

149
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,563
But you do have a type, right?

150
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,649
Like younger or older girls?

151
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,778
That's a difficult question…

152
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>Recently, I often think about…</i>

153
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,829
<i>how the human mind is heavily affected</i>
<i>by the body's growth.</i>

154
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,875
<i>At the infant stage, it's hard to record</i>
<i>memories due to infantile amnesia.</i>

155
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,756
<i>The second growth spurt during puberty</i>
<i>raised my awareness to my surroundings.</i>

156
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,260
<i>As I grow older,</i>

157
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,347
<i>my mentality is what gradually conforms</i>
<i>to my body and environment.</i>

158
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,645
The line between me and Aqua Hoshino
fades more and more.

159
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,275
I've always been too scared to ask you.

160
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,486
Do you perhaps have…

161
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,988
eighth-grader syndrome?

162
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,074
You need to grow out of that.
Makes me cringe just listening.

163
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,954
In short, I'm saying that
I'm a high schooler too.

164
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,417
I find girls who are close to my age
as a love interest.

165
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,796
Though there's no mistake
I like them somewhat older.

166
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,423
So you like older girls?

167
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,508
Really?

168
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,718
1ST YEAR / 2ND YEAR

169
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,927
Really?

170
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,638
Just throw it already.

171
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:38,930
2ND YEAR

172
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,893
Really…

173
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,311
Hmm…

174
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,604
Really…

175
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,521
What?

176
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,649
It's nothing!

177
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,234
Oh, that was a nice throw.

178
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,611
Really?

179
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,154
Are you really a beginner?

180
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,114
That's right.

181
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,241
This is the first time with you.

182
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,743
My very first.

183
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,623
Maybe I can aim to be an idol
who pitches at baseball games?

184
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,584
<i>I knew it.</i>

185
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,713
<i>My feelings for</i>
<i>Akane Kurokawa aren't romantic.</i>

186
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,383
<i>I gotta thank Arima.</i>

187
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,554
<i>I was able to organize my thoughts.</i>

188
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,810
<i>I was just seeing Ai Hoshino</i>
<i>inside of Akane Kurokawa.</i>

189
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,772
It's almost the end of the shoot, huh?

190
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,191
It makes me sad.

191
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,529
Once I put on a persona like you said,
I gained popularity.

192
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,905
You really helped me.

193
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,281
Thank you.

194
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,825
Your acting…

195
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,410
Or no, transformation.

196
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,414
It felt like a dream,
like I was seeing the real thing.

197
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,624
How do you do that?

198
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,377
Well, it's not that impressive.

199
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,173
But I do read books
on psychological profiling.

200
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:58,677
I just research a lot
and make my own interpretations.

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,680
I add on a bunch of backstory
of my own too.

202
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,889
Your own backstory?

203
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:03,807
Yeah.

204
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,016
For example…

205
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,520
Ai actually had a child in secret.

206
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,608
If that were the case,
her unbroken line would be maintained.

207
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,486
And it also explains
many of her puzzling actions.

208
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,448
I'm able to understand her personality

209
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,992
and calculate her thoughts
like through a math formula!

210
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,079
How much of Ai's thinking pattern
can you figure out?

211
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,747
Umm…

212
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,711
Up to what kind of life she led
and what kind of men she liked…

213
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,672
I think I'd be able to
figure most of that out.

214
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,680
<i>Talent gathers in the entertainment world.</i>

215
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:54,316
<i>For me, that carefree, cluster of talent,</i>
<i>Ai Hoshino, was a mystery.</i>

216
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,071
<i>I could not understand what she felt</i>
<i>and what she wanted to do.</i>

217
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,619
<i>This talent called Akane Kurokawa</i>

218
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:10,790
<i>can understand and trace Ai's actions</i>
<i>much more than me,</i>

219
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,210
<i>even though I had spent years with her.</i>

220
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,298
<i>Our relationship is simply professional.</i>

221
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,928
<i>Once this program ends,</i>
<i>there will be no interaction between us.</i>

222
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,349
<i>However,</i>

223
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,394
<i>I can use Akane Kurokawa.</i>

224
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,107
<i>There's no way I can let her go right now.</i>

225
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,294
COUPLE ESTABLISHED

226
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,547
This is seriously the worst.

227
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,008
Drop dead, you idiot.

228
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:09,057
And that's a wrap for the shoot of
<i>We're About To Fall In Love ♥ For Real</i>!

229
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,059
Good work, everyone!

230
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,065
Man, when I think back,
it went by really quick.

231
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,777
A lot happened, but I honestly enjoyed it.

232
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,613
If you can say that, Akane,
we got no complaints here!

233
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,156
So…

234
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,242
Can we ask the good stuff?

235
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,995
About that last kiss!
Are you two really gonna go out?!

236
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,580
What's gonna happen?!

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,084
I don't know.

238
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,630
The program's flow was
to accept it back there,

239
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,841
but I have work, so I can't be dating…

240
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,385
Oh, come on, even if you're a celebrity,

241
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,972
it's normal to have a boyfriend or two
in high school!

242
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,892
Yuki, you probably have
one after another, right?

243
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,935
Is that how you see me?

244
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,939
Seriously,
I've always prioritized my work,

245
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,817
so I've never had a boyfriend before.

246
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,277
No way!

247
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,446
I hear it's true.

248
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,157
The girls at Yuki's school
said the same thing.

249
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,326
She's surprisingly hard to get.

250
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,078
But apparently, many models are dating.

251
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:16,541
The ratio of idols or actresses dating
should be similar to average people's.

252
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:22,047
Well, I'm sure that ratio is pretty low
for people in agencies that ban dating.

253
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,965
Though some are caught by the press.

254
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,884
In that aspect,

255
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,846
it's good to start dating on a show
because it won't become a scandal!

256
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,972
But…

257
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:35,352
That's right, I want you guys to use
the show to your advantage.

258
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,775
The program won't interfere from here.

259
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,737
If you wanna go out or break up,
that's up to you guys.

260
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,784
<i>There are a number of pairs</i>
<i>who've even gotten married.</i>

261
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:56,706
<i>And some keep up the couple act</i>
<i>for a few months too, just for show.</i>

262
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,335
Make sure to rack your brain

263
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,128
and make your own decision.

264
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,756
In this industry,

265
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,095
there's a ton of bad grown-ups
who'll use your talent and toss you later.

266
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,847
Many sweet temptations exist
in this field,

267
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,394
but the kids who tend to go with the flow
all end up in a hellhole.

268
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,236
That's my advice to you as a bad grown-up.

269
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,616
Speaking of which, where's the bad kid?

270
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,958
<i>Love For Real </i>has good reviews.

271
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,671
I guess my decision
to use you wasn't a mistake.

272
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,589
Who knows.

273
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,844
As a result, it just looks like
we gathered attention from the backlash.

274
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,180
I heard you made up for that
with your own hands.

275
00:16:55,265 --> 00:17:00,020
But that video became a bit of a problem
with the higher-ups.

276
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:06,234
<i>It's a hard-and-fast rule in this industry</i>
<i>to never leak footage from the filming.</i>

277
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,821
<i>So they were questioning that issue.</i>

278
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,492
Despite being a cast member,
you violated that rule.

279
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:19,080
Even the topic came up
to sue Ichigo Production for damages.

280
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:24,335
But that didn't happen, did it?

281
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:32,844
It says the cast can upload offstage shots
to the official accounts in the contract.

282
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,848
That's why I uploaded the video
to the official social media account,

283
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,476
so I did my work
just like the contract said.

284
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,187
You sure know what you're doing.

285
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,271
Thanks.

286
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:48,485
And you carried out the deal with me
and did a good job.

287
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,529
I'll have to compensate you properly.

288
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,117
You wanna go eat some sushi
sometime next week?

289
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,954
I'll let you hear my juicy story on Ai.

290
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,707
I'll keep it open.

291
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,377
Oh, Aqua!

292
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,254
Come here for a minute!

293
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,340
You're not getting away!

294
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,720
It really was fun.

295
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,514
Hey, Aqua…

296
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,225
What do you wanna do from here?

297
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,186
What do I wanna do? Ah.

298
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,897
The episode's been released already,

299
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,358
so we'll have to act
like a couple for a while.

300
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,902
Well, of course I know that much.

301
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,612
-So then…
-So that's why…

302
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,072
Um…

303
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,534
Is our relationship just work?

304
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,495
Or is this serious?

305
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,081
Well, it's not exactly work.

306
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,208
You don't have to mind me.

307
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:50,255
Aqua, you don't see me
as a love interest, right?

308
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,172
Well…

309
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,633
I can tell that much.

310
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,264
It's true that I don't see
you as a love interest.

311
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,809
I consider this relationship
as an extension of work.

312
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:08,648
However, I do have a strong interest
in you as an actress, Akane.

313
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,067
This isn't a lie.

314
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,820
I see.

315
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,490
Oh well.

316
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:22,453
Since those are the words
that make me the happiest to hear.

317
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,168
Then as work,
let's be boyfriend-girlfriend.

318
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,671
We'll leave it to Yuki and Nobu
to be the real boyfriend-girlfriend.

319
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,589
What?

320
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,090
You didn't notice?

321
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,053
Yuki and Nobu started going out
the other day.

322
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,265
Seriously? But she rejected him
during the shoot…

323
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,058
She's very clever.

324
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,023
But I do like that about Yuki.

325
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,485
Looks like this is really
Yuki's first boyfriend in her life.

326
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,071
You can never tell.

327
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,370
See you later!

328
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,622
Good night!

329
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,169
Mem, you aren't taking a cab?

330
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,088
No, since I can walk home from here.

331
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,175
Oh yeah, we live pretty close.

332
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:21,054
Most people in this industry
live in this area anyway.

333
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,188
I'm sad.

334
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:34,651
I liked this set so much.

335
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:36,778
I see.

336
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,989
But Aqua, you're not that sad, are you?

337
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,784
Since you're Akane's boyfriend now!

338
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,036
Our relationship's just for work.

339
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,291
Well, that could be the start?

340
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,044
I mean, you could eventually
become serious.

341
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,254
I won't.

342
00:20:54,337 --> 00:21:00,677
That's what you say now, but you were
all red when Akane was acting as Ai!

343
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,678
Hmm?

344
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,766
By the way, I'm surprised you knew.
You're not in the B Komachi generation.

345
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,812
Well, B Komachi is everyone's dream!

346
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,152
Just between you and me,

347
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,157
my dream was to become an idol.

348
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,537

Hm.

351
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,088

00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,549

00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,515
Me in B Komachi?
