00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,635
ICHIGO PRODUCTION SAITOU

2
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:37,097
Maybe I should've hired you
as a talent scout.

3
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,268
A popular YouTuber
as well as an influencer, Mem.

4
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,063
I was surprised to know
you were interested in idols.

5
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,818
You have 370,000 subscribers
on your YouTube channel.

6
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:52,822
And 638,000 TikTok followers.

7
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:55,032
You seem to be very popular online.

8
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,953
First, I'd like to first ask
what agency you are with, Ms. Mem.

9
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:03,374
I'm actually self-employed
as an online streamer.

10
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,836
Currently, I'm with an agency called FARM,

11
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:10,589
but I'm not registered with them,
I work as a business partner.

12
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:15,344
I'm under a contract where I can freely
take on jobs myself with no problems.

13
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,595
I see.

14
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:21,559
In that case, Ichigo Production
will be offering idol work to you.

15
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,272
We have many internet personalities too,
so there's no problems with the contract.

16
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,899
It would be perfect for us.

17
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:34,321
But your expression tells me that
there's something you need to say.

18
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,367
Well, I've got a hunch.

19
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,204
You're lying about your age, aren't you?

20
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,665
Can you tell?

21
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,836
Yes, you look very young
based on your build,

22
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,838
but you can't fool my eyes.

23
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,466
But you don't need to worry.

24
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,846
It's very common for freelancing girls
to lie a few years about their age.

25
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,764
I don't really mind.

26
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,308
Are you sure?

27
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,726
I'm so glad.

28
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,186
So, how old are you really?

29
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,481
Um... well...

30
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,650
I'm actually...

31
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,361
Mm-hm.

32
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,241
You really stretched it!

33
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,285
I apologize!

34
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:26,332
If you're officially 18 years old,
you got some major guts.

35
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,791
Please don't count!

36
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,920
How many years did you subtract?
Like three?

37
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:33,797
Double that.

38
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,257
You sure stretched it!

39
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,259
Wait, so you're 24?

40
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,846
I was 24 until spring.

41
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,725
Which means you're 25. Don't try
to struggle your way out at this point.

42
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,355
So you were on the show as a teenager
at 25? You got monstrous mental strength.

43
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,357
There's a reason to this!

44
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,820
My dream was to become an idol
since I was little.

45
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,075
<i>But I was raised by a single mom
and I also have two little brothers.</i>

46
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,620
<i>So I felt that I should find
a job right away.</i>

47
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,288
<i>But Mama told me...</i>

48
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,375
Don't worry, just chase your dreams!

49
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,335
Mama will be with you to help!

50
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,922
<i>After that, I started applying
to auditions.</i>

51
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,925
<i>I even made it
to a major agency's last screening.</i>

52
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,178
<i>But during my 3rd year in high school...</i>

53
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,557
<i>Mama worked too hard and was hospitalized.</i>

54
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,185
<i>I needed money,</i>

55
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,106
<i>so I took a break from high school
and worked at all kinds of jobs.</i>

56
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,402
Thanks to that, I was able
to send my brothers to college,

57
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,529
and my mom got better too.

58
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,283
But by that time, I was already 23.

59
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,829
<i>You know how you're treated
as a granny at 20 in this world?</i>

60
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:51,792
<i>Every audition application said,
"Any female up to 20 years of age."</i>

61
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,421
By the time I was in a state
to chase my dreams,

62
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,299
I wasn't at an age to chase them anymore.

63
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:02,511
I began streaming after losing my way
of becoming an idol.

64
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,348
And I was still on break
from high school at the time,

65
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,019
so I joked that
I was a current high school girl.

66
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,021
But then I got surprisingly popular.

67
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,940
And I gained subscribers like crazy.

68
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,776
Then I couldn't back out anymore!

69
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:22,281
I continued like that for two years
and here I am today.

70
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,284
I know, this isn't okay.

71
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,830
I lied about seven years, and it would be
a major problem if it got out.

72
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,499
A 25-year-old as an idol could never...

73
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,626
That's not true.

74
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,130
Mem-cho!

75
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,216
The real thing! So cute!

76
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,260
I heard the whole story.

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,178
Arima.

78
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,931
I'm also someone
who was scorned for their age,

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,476
so I can relate a little.

80
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,144
It doesn't seem like a little.

81
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:57,191
Once I got older in elementary school,
my child acting agency kicked me out.

82
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,692
It really pisses me off!

83
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,902
What?

84
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,153
Mrs. Miyako!

85
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,656
That's why I never said no.

86
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,699
And you, Ruby?

87
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,909
Of course!

88
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,037
Age doesn't matter in becoming an idol!

89
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,165
Because you can't stop anyone
from dreaming!

90
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,546
Welcome to B Komachi!

91
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,008
Yeah... Thank you.

92
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,637
There goes my sister
with her sugarcoating again.

93
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,349
Arima, take care of Ruby and Mem for me.

94
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,851
Shut up, don't talk to me so casually.

95
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,188
Go take care of Akane Kurokawa.

96
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,232
You womanizing steward!

97
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,611
I'm gonna keep this group together
even without you telling me.

98
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,531
Hey, let's go out to eat right now.

99
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,949
Let's go!

100
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,286
What's with these girls?
They're so warmhearted!

101
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,998
<i>And like that, Mem-cho joined our group.</i>

102
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,879
<i>And the newly formed B Komachi
made its official start.</i>

103
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,930
Aww, <i>Love For Real</i> ended.

104
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:15,269
Hey, how did you feel
seeing your brother kissing on the show?

105
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,104
How did I feel?

106
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,400
Can there be anything other
than super mixed feelings?

107
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,860
I thought so.

108
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,115
It was five times as awkward as watching
a brother and sister kissing on TV.

109
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,700
Eek...

110
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,829
Ruby, you'll probably meet
Akane one day too.

111
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,415
Since she <i>is</i> your brother's girlfriend.

112
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,125
Girlfriend...

113
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:45,048
<i>But Aqua's feelings
toward Akane is probably...</i>

114
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,301
Is this about <i>Love For Real</i>?

115
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,887
Oh, yeah.

116
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,389
You knew about it, Ms. Shiranui?

117
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,767
Well, someone I know is on it after all.
It was interesting.

118
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,145
You don't need to be so considerate.

119
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,023
There were nothing but pretty boys
and cute girls in it.

120
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,858
It was great eye candy.

121
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,859
Eye candy?!

122
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,529
I didn't think a top star would say
something like that too.

123
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,115
Who doesn't like pretty faces?

124
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:15,496
It pleased my eyes so much,
I think my eyesight got better by 0.5.

125
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,706
<i>She says some funny stuff!</i>

126
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,710
Personally, I liked Mem-cho's maiden face.

127
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,714
If I were one of the boys,
I would've totally made her mine.

128
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,300
I wish they would have put more spirit
into seducing her.

129
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,762
Ms. Shiranui is very cool on TV,

130
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,097
but I didn't know
she was like this in private.

131
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,767
But I hear this is common actually.

132
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,355
<i>Men tend to feel rivalry toward
funny women before romantic feelings,</i>

133
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,233
<i>making it difficult for them
to become popular.</i>

134
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,778
<i>So they're not allowed to joke
while they have on an innocent image.</i>

135
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,696
<i>What an ugly fact.</i>

136
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,700
Maybe it's because I'm watching it
from the cast's acquaintance view,

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,536
but it made my heart race.

138
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,663
I'm sure everyone else feels the same too.

139
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,668
<i>I hear Aqua is super popular
with the girls in the General Department.</i>

140
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,296
<i>Some girls in our department
are interested in him too.</i>

141
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,091
<i>But he supposedly has a girlfriend,</i>

142
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,885
<i>so I'm sure everyone
will just watch over for now.</i>

143
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,848
<i>In fact,</i> Love For Real<i>'s following
is very high,</i>

144
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,936
<i>and it must've been a major influence
for my brother's future.</i>

145
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:25,148
<i>But it also made a significant impact
on B Komachi.</i>

146
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,859
<i>With Mem-cho joining,</i>

147
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:32,614
<i>we're now able to create
more professional videos for our channel.</i>

148
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,826
Wow! We reached 10,000 subscribers!

149
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,954
Well, I created the user flow
from my channel too,

150
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,040
so this much should be expected.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,794
It feels... really official!

152
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,838
If it isn't official,
what else would it be?

153
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,050
We only have
self-introduction videos uploaded,

154
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,095
so I'd like to put up our music videos
as soon as we can.

155
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,557
But how is our music-related stuff
going right now?

156
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,852
Looks like the CEO's asking
an artist she knows to write it.

157
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,147
We can't do anything
until the music's ready.

158
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,609
It's still a long way ahead,
so let's just sit back and wait.

159
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,819
Well, we can't do that.

160
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,780
Did you forget that we're B Komachi?

161
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,117
B Komachi has B Komachi songs, right?

162
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,288
Oh yeah! There's no problems
if we use the old songs!

163
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,205
Right!

164
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,499
Mem-cho, you're a genius!

165
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,418
Tsk. So they noticed.

166
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,755
There's a lot we can do right now!

167
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,467
If we waste too much time,
I'll hit my thirties!

168
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,885
So self-deprecating...

169
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,346
The first and foremost duty as an idol!

170
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,599
The idol's most splendorous
and toughest part...

171
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,518
We're gonna learn the dance choreography!

172
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,107
LET'S B KOMACHI
DANCE LESSON!!

173
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,125
<i>There's 30 songs with choreography
that have footage left.</i>

174
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,462
<i>Don't tell me they want
to learn all of it.</i>

175
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:15,092
<i>I can't keep up
with these two idol otakus' motivation.</i>

176
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,098
Why did I say that I'll become an idol?

177
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,896
Good work.

178
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,148
Thank...

179
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,569
I don't need it! Go away!

180
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,074
You've been acting like this
toward me for a while now.

181
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,287
I know that you mouth off
and have a bad attitude, but...

182
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,875
at this rate, I'll get hurt too.

183
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:56,091
<i>What's with that? Huh?</i>

184
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,801
<i>You were the one who...</i>

185
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,177
<i>You're the one...</i>

186
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:00,804
Aqua!

187
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:23,160
Me telling you this story now is
like digging up someone's grave.

188
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,539
Why do you want to know about Ai so much?

189
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,791
I'm a fan of hers.

190
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,501
A hopeless one.

191
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,296
Do you need a reason beyond that?

192
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:39,676
The illusion seen by fans shatter
once they know the reality.

193
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,512
There is no exception to this.

194
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,892
Showbiz is pretty much a bluffing contest.

195
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,228
An alluring subject tells an alluring lie

196
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:54,441
in order to stage a charismatic figure
that doesn't really exist in real life.

197
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,113
What most people do in job hunting
to get into good companies

198
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,116
is what we do for business.

199
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,952
Even so, I'd still like to know.

200
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,915
If you say you're a fan,
it's best not to know.

201
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,667
But no one ever listens.

202
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,132
I connected with Ai and introduced her
some jobs like I told you before.

203
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:24,346
<i>Back then, Ai was just a country girl
who just moved here from the sticks.</i>

204
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:28,058
<i>Her level of professionalism was low,
she'd never try to fit in,</i>

205
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,311
<i>and she'd come to work wearing
cheap clothes that never suited her.</i>

206
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,063
She was just a child.

207
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,275
So, I thought it might help her somehow,

208
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,487
so I introduced her
to this one theater's workshop.

209
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,738
A workshop?

210
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,700
It's one that I used to be a part of
during college.

211
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,911
It's called Theater Lalalai.

212
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,122
<i>The theater group that Akane belongs to.</i>

213
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,876
<i>It wasn't that famous at the time though.</i>

214
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,587
They say love changes people.

215
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,048
That's probably the place...

216
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,842
<i>where Ai fell in love.</i>

217
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,975
<i>Ever since Ai joined that workshop,
she started to care about her appearance.</i>

218
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,019
<i>And she would ask me
where the good restaurants were.</i>

219
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,982
<i>Of course I couldn't tell
who her dates were,</i>

220
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,485
<i>but I remember she suddenly
looked all grown-up.</i>

221
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,073
If you're curious, I'll introduce you
to Lalalai's superintendent.

222
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,952
You'll surely get closer to the answer
you're looking for there.

223
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,080
Why would you go that far for me?

224
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,709
I'm just a failed actor
with no achievements whatsoever.

225
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,920
Because I see potential in you.

226
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,882
This industry is all about give-and-take.

227
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,302
<i>As you already know, in Japanese showbiz,</i>

228
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:49,848
<i>the give-and-take between the agencies and
production companies affect the casting.</i>

229
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,561
<i>And depending on the cast, the profit
changes by the hundred millions.</i>

230
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,731
This 40,000-yen sushi
will feel like nothing

231
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,525
compared to how much money
will be exchanged.

232
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,778
By you owing me a favor now,

233
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,324
once you become a star
and you hit your prime,

234
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:12,078
I can have a big advantage
in the casting battles to come.

235
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,583
This is what a producer does.

236
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,711
Of course, I don't do this just to you.

237
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:24,466
I see potential in Kana Arima
and Mem-cho too.

238
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:29,137
Looks like you kids have
started something interesting.

239
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,141
I hear you guys revived
that B Komachi group.

240
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,563
I feel that all of you are quite
the promising investment.

241
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,857
You don't mean...

242
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,652
Japan Idol Festival?!

243
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:48,323
Yeah, the producer from <i>Love For Real</i>
says he has connections.

244
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,992
So if we're interested,
he said he'll squeeze us in.

245
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,453
But JIF's next month, right?!

246
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,706
No way! We're not prepared at all.

247
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,710
If some newbies like us
suddenly went on a big stage like that--

248
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,087
Let's do it!

249
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,756
<i>It's JIF,</i> the <i>JIF!</i>

250
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:09,719
Wouldn't it be cool if the new B Komachi's
first concert is at a big stage like that?

251
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,723
But we'll definitely create
a bad impression to those around us.

252
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,226
I'm sure they'll say
connection this and connection that.

253
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,978
Don't worry!

254
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,399
We're the successors
of the legendary group, B Komachi!

255
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,694
You're the one
who started saying that on your own.

256
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,114
But in reality, there's no way
we let this chance go.

257
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:33,660
A normal group spends long hard years
to finally get to this stage.

258
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,164
So if we don't do this now,
what are we working towards?

259
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,167
Well, that's true.

260
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,880
If we're gonna do it, let's do it.

261
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,799
This is work after all.

262
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,342
Okay, it's decided!

263
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,302
Then it's time!

264
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,930
We gotta decide now.

265
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,973
What?

266
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,644
Who to have as B Komachi's center role.

267
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,063
Is it that important?

268
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,149
Who cares who the center is?

269
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,400
It <i>is</i> important!

270
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,528
The center is the idol group's star!

271
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,948
The cute one who can sing and dance,
they're the face of the group!

272
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,617
It's the most important position!

273
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,910
Right?

274
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,829
You two really get along.

275
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,416
So, does anyone want to do it?

276
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:27,380
I-I'm not saying that I wanna do it,
but if everyone insists...

277
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,592
This probably has
to be the oldest and wisest.

278
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:35,096
I don't wanna do it, but my experience
should help bring the group together.

279
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,558
You both look like you really wanna do it.

280
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,436
I mean, shouldn't it be me
who's good at dancing?

281
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:45,440
Well, no, it should be me who's used to
the media and well-experienced!

282
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,068
If you put it that way,
that would make it <i>Senpai</i>.

283
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,196
Since her "Green Pepper Exercise"
took 1st place on the charts

284
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,906
and she was all over music shows.

285
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,824
Wow, what a throwback!

286
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,160
Don't bring up my embarrassing past!

287
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,288
Let's start the "Green Pepper Exercise"!

288
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,458
<i>Eat green peppers and become Superman</i>

289
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,669
<i>Everybody dance and become Peter Pan</i>

290
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,298
You know how she sang a little off-key...

291
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:14,135
Right? That was so childlike and cute!

292
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,554
They made me dance to it in kindergarten.

293
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,139
Hey, try singing it!

294
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,808
No way!

295
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,310
I know that I suck at singing!

296
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,605
I mean, don't you have to be able
to sing as the center?

297
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:30,318
That's true, it doesn't look good
if the center doesn't hold a mic.

298
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,694
How despicable.

299
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,906
How about whoever gets
a higher score in karaoke gets it?!

300
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,324
All right!

301
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,534
<i>Senpai</i>, you too, right?!

302
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,285
I'll pass.

303
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,745
What? But...

304
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,749
Stupid, the center is
the group's face, right?

305
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:49,170
If you put me as the center,
this group won't get any popular.

306
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,547
That's not true.

307
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,092
There's enough evidence to prove it.

308
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,887
Even after my one-hit wonder
child star years were over,

309
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,517
you think that I'd only be acting while
I clung to this industry for years?

310
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,813
I tried a variety of fields,
but never got popular.

311
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:11,860
I put the agency that gave me work
for my child star fame in the red,

312
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,321
but I made sure to take my pay,
so I could feed myself.

313
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,325
To sum it up,
there are no fans following Kana Arima!

314
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:24,414
I totally agree! Who'd wanna put money
into a foul-mouthed, jaded woman like me?

315
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,293
Oh, that's right, <i>I'll Go with Sweet Today</i>
was in the red too, huh?!

316
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,588
Mem-cho, you have a ton of subscribers.

317
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:36,551
Ruby, you at least got a great face, and
your innocence will probably win fans.

318
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,303
<i>Besides...</i>

319
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,558
the ones who are likable
are honest cute girls like you two.

320
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,812
Not a difficult and bitter woman like me.

321
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,192
You can just think of me as decoration.

322
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,320
Karaoke or whatever,
just choose the center between you two.

323
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,115
<i>Senpai</i>, you're really sulky lately.

324
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,534
Did something bad happen?

325
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,036
Not really.

326
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,330
Don't worry!

327
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,376
Even my brother who never compliments
people said that you're cute.

328
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,962
You're not difficult or bitter at all.

329
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:17,342
But he said that to Mem-cho
in <i>Love For Real</i> too.

330
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,969
What a difficult and bitter woman...

331
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,180
You always have to argue.

332
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,933
It must be tough
for whoever dates someone like this.

333
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,686
Well, most celebrities
are difficult people.

334
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,441
<i>Wait, Aqua's the one
who invited these two to join.</i>

335
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:38,988
<i>I don't like how I can gradually see
what kind of women my brother likes.</i>

336
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,698
Come join us later.

337
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,741
Okay.

338
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,161

LET'S WORK A LITTLE HARDER!

340
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,163
43 POINTS
OH... OKAY. TRY HARDER?

341
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,043
I'm surprised you took up this challenge
with a score like that!

342
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,379
Y-You too, you're in the quirky category!

343
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,339
Idols are all about uniqueness!

344
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,800
Even being quirky has value!

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,344
But if you suck, you can't help that!

346
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:05,515
The joy of watching a poor singer
get gradually better live!

347
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:11,479
I'm thinking of providing this
to the fans! There's a story there!

348
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,902
I should've practiced singing
more seriously.

349
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,779
We both need training!

350
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,408
Please don't put me
on the same level as you.

351
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,868
Why don't we take a quick break?

352
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,789
Right. Let's sing a light song
as a breather.

353
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,583
Why don't we sing
<i>Senpai</i>'s "Green Pepper Exercise"?

354
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:37,422
Ruby, you got a pretty evil personality.
I honestly like it.

355
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,049
- Oh.
- Hm?

356
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:45,263
Arima released a lot of songs after
"Green Pepper Exercise."

357
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,223
I never knew.

358
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,766
Wanna listen to it?

359
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,684
Yeah.

360
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,604
KANA ARIMA

361
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,782
Seriously, what a difficult person.

362
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,534
And she says she sucks?

363
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,451
97 POINTS

364
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,578
<i>Isn't she too hard on herself?</i>

365
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,913
97 POINTS
AMAZING!!

366
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:10,843
