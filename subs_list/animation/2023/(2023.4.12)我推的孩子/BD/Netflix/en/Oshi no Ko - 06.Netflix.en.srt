1
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,347
I want to quit <i>Love For Real.</i>

2
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,389
What?!

3
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:38,307
Right now?!

4
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,601
Why are you saying this?!

5
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:45,856
Lately, the guys at school tease me.

6
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,400
Like, "So you like those types of guys?"

7
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:53,864
Nothing's scarier than openly showing
your feelings for someone you like.

8
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,743
I had no idea until the show started.

9
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:01,956
Drawing attention
from many people isn't all good.

10
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,168
I do dumb stuff on my channel too,
so I understand.

11
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:11,674
Everyone thinks I'm dumb…
Well, in fact, I am dumb though.

12
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,260
A-Are you really going to quit?

13
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,303
I'll listen anytime you need to talk!

14
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,056
If you're gonna quit, I'll quit too!

15
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,266
Nobu…

16
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,726
So don't be like that. Let's continue!

17
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,187
I…

18
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,190
WILL YUKI REALLY LEAVE THE SHOW?

19
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,025
Wow, I wonder what's gonna happen!

20
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,779
She might really quit.
Since Yuki seems sensitive.

21
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,407
But what will happen to Nobu
if she quits?!

22
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,867
YUKI SUMI TO QUIT DATING SHOW?

23
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,494
Look! I'm in a news article!

24
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,622
You think I contributed a little
in gaining viewers?

25
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:44,707
Probably.

26
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,167
So, are you going to quit the show?

27
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,796
Well, I can't quit, can I?
There's a contract.

28
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,549
What? So that was an act?

29
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:58,929
No, no, I'm not an actress like you,
Kurokawa, so I can't act.

30
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,057
I just exaggerated my feelings a little.

31
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,477
It's true that I was sad
from being teased at school.

32
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,314
And it's also true
that I've thought about quitting.

33
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,860
Because this show is always filmed
first thing in the morning.

34
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,029
I'm always so sleepy.

35
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,532
I see, so it's not a lie,
but an exaggeration.

36
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,409
An exaggeration, huh?

37
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,454
<i>Once we started opening up</i>
<i>after some time passed on the show,</i>

38
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,497
<i>everyone's character became clear.</i>

39
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,917
<i>The ones who are good at this.</i>

40
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,836
<i>The one who isn't two-faced but unique.</i>

41
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,007
<i>The ones who aren't good on camera</i>
<i>and has little appearance.</i>

42
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,053
Aqua! Let's go eat once we're done!

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,513
No, I'm good. I have food at home.

44
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,224
Come on, let's go!

45
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,226
Mem-cho says she'll treat us to <i>yakiniku</i>.

46
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,102
What?! I never said that!

47
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:51,065
I know that you gained new subscribers
recently and you're loaded.

48
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,317
Your agency only takes
50% of the cut, right?

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,235
Seriously?!

50
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,738
We split 80/20 at my agency. I envy you.

51
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,490
Ermm…

52
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,451
All right! Add on another
extra premium assortment!

53
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,162
Stuff yourselves, brats!

54
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,039
Yay!

55
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,625
Aqua, the <i>kainomi</i> is cooked.

56
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,878
I'll grill my own,
so don't worry about me.

57
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,881
Kurokawa, you haven't been eating at all.

58
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,509
No, this is my role!

59
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,096
I've decided to never release
the tongs in these settings.

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,391
People would get mad when I used
to burn the meat before,

61
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,601
but I can grill them well now.

62
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,480
That's why!

63
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,567
What's being demanded right now
is something more extreme!

64
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,361
It's like, how much risk you take…

65
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,862
<i>She's so studious.</i>

66
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,201
Ah, I'm sure the <i>yakiniku </i>was luxurious.

67
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,956
I bet the meat you ate while staring at
some cute girls tasted real good, huh?

68
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,582
Well, it was just a hangout.

69
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,919
Liar! I can see the satisfaction
oozing out from your face!

70
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,421
No, it's not.

71
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,631
Look me in my eyes and say that!

72
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:02,011
<i>With a young body, you can eat unlimited</i>
<i>oily foods and never get indigestion.</i>

73
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,429
<i>This is too awesome.</i>

74
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,849
You promised to eat with us
on Sundays together.

75
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,310
But it's been like this
ever since that show started!

76
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,896
First of all, isn't that show's concept
to meet after school?

77
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,983
But they always film on weekends.
It's a setup!

78
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,193
It's not a big deal.

79
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,196
They're good at least
for prioritizing education.

80
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,075
Actually, reality dating shows
aren't set up as much as you think.

81
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,786
A few of them are obviously faking it,

82
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,165
but most of them are just trying to
make themselves look good.

83
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,418
Everyone does that in real life,
don't they?

84
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,212
If you go on a group date,
you can see the same thing.

85
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,631
I've never been to one,
so I wouldn't know…

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,718
Then does everyone seriously fall in love?

87
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,595
That depends on the individual.

88
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,848
You end up liking them surprisingly.

89
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,269
But my fans are watching, so I want to
keep it to a certain level on the show.

90
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,899
I do! It's kinda similar to getting close
to a host at a host club!

91
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,653
I shift into work mode when I'm on camera,
so it's a little hard.

92
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,823
Out of the question. It's work.

93
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,703
I seriously can. I mean, wouldn't it
be fun if it led up to marriage?

94
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,789
I don't know…

95
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,667
I'm just barely fulfilling my role,
so I don't have the room for that.

96
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:20,422
I never watched reality dating shows
before, so I lacked knowledge on it.

97
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,427
I had a biased view, but its realism is
enough for it to be the selling point.

98
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,680
Contrary to what I imagined,
not a lot is set up.

99
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:34,186
And it's filmed to show the individuals'
character just as they are.

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,776
What's the matter? Isn't it a good thing
that there aren't many setups?

101
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,195
It's good from the audience's view.

102
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:47,241
But lies are also the best way
to protect yourself.

103
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,786
Well, it's probably
a needless worry though.

104
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,802
<i>Later on,</i>

105
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:11,598
<i>the Yuki Sumi and Nobuyuki Kumano pair</i>
<i>becomes the focus of the show.</i>

106
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,018
<i>That's where Kengo shows his jealousy.</i>

107
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,522
<i>A love triangle is formed over Yuki.</i>

108
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,818
<i>Yuki becomes the gamemaster,</i>

109
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,320
<i>and her flirty character excites the show.</i>

110
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,366
<i>And the show gradually</i>
<i>gains popularity from teenagers.</i>

111
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,912
Aqua, what about you?

112
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,290
Are you not gonna
join the battle over Yuki?

113
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,835
If you wanna get popular, it's better
to mingle with them instead of me.

114
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,423
I'm good. I want to play it safe
until the show ends.

115
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,383
You have no ambition…

116
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,845
What about you?
Aren't you going to butt in?

117
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:54,641
As long as I can keep this dumb,
laid-back role, I'm okay.

118
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:58,479
Since my goal is to lead viewers
to my own channel.

119
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:03,233
But if you wanna make a move on me
seriously, now that's a different story.

120
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,985
Don't get your hopes up.

121
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,449
But the one we should be
more worried about is…

122
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,211
She sells seashells by the seashore.

123
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:26,673
The shells she sells are sea-shells,
I'm sure. For if she sells sea-shells…

124
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,439
-Excuse me…
-Do you want to be fired?!

125
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,817
I heard the reality show Akane's
in was popular, so I watched it,

126
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,444
but what the hell is that?!

127
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,072
She probably wasn't even on screen
for ten minutes!

128
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,659
This is her chance,
but she isn't standing out one bit!

129
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,370
You're the manager!
Why aren't you lecturing her?!

130
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,789
But Boss, Akane is doing her best and--

131
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,166
Doing her best doesn't make any money!

132
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,254
I chose her out of a ton of kids
who said they wanted to do it!

133
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,090
At least make her leave a mark
on the show!

134
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm sorry, Manager…

135
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,640
Oh. You were listening?

136
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,727
Akane, you're doing the best you can,
so don't worry.

137
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,564
I'll act as your shield for you.

138
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,238
I-It's because I'm not good enough…

139
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:33,782
I must work harder.

140
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,661
I need to work harder to leave a mark.

141
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,915
Ugh, this juice is gross.

142
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,501
I'll post this on Twitter
to get my money's worth.

143
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,005
"The new drink I bought
at the convenience store was ultra gross…"

144
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,715
Hey!

145
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,133
What was that for?

146
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,926
What were <i>you </i>just trying to do?!

147
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,138
What if you write a bad comment
about a company's product,

148
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,140
and they happened to be egosurfing?!

149
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,725
No, they wouldn't.

150
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,893
Jeez, you ex-commoners know nothing.

151
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:06,315
If you write about a product, at least
five affiliated people will see it!

152
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,068
And that company
will never offer you a job!

153
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,820
You're exaggerating.

154
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,406
Don't you egosurf yourself?

155
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,532
No, I don't.

156
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,577
Gimme your phone!

157
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,911
Oh! Give it back!

158
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:20,954
Let's see.

159
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,165
That's a lot of digging.

160
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,461
Oh my, you've even put "cute"
in your search words.

161
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,880
Did you wanna see
people call you cute that much?

162
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,759
Everyone says they don't egosurf,
but let me state this!

163
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,094
Ninety percent of idols all egosurf!

164
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,264
Try going to a wrap party after an event.

165
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:43,685
It's funny how all musicians and
performers are egosurfing as they drink.

166
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,062
Whoa.

167
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,980
The world has entered a great egosurf era!

168
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,359
You can now access big data
without being an advertising agency,

169
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,987
so you can look up analytics
on reviews and target audience!

170
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,198
Web advertising now costs
as much as traditional ads

171
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,784
and is said to be
a two-trillion-yen market!

172
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,287
The days of ignoring
internet responses have ended.

173
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:06,500
The ones who lack online marketing are
the ones to retire first in society now.

174
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,796
The content creators and the fans are now
mutually monitoring each other.

175
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,341
And in this industry,
we are the content itself.

176
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:20,972
<i>Don't forget that if you gaze long into</i>
<i>an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.</i>

177
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,224
AKANE'S NONEXISTENT

178
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,185
YUKI'S CUTE
AKANE'S NONEXISTENT…

179
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,437
I gotta work harder.

180
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,610
What are you doing?

181
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,864
I was taking a video for the show's
official Twitter and TikTok accounts.

182
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,990
Hm.

183
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:44,162
We've been gaining lots of subscribers.
Well, that's all thanks to me of course!

184
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,040
Speaking of which, Mem,
weren't you originally a TikToker?

185
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,502
Yup. There was no affiliate marketing
or Coins at the time,

186
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,629
so I switched over to being a YouTuber.

187
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,132
Aqua, you upload something too!

188
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,635
I don't know how to use those platforms
for the youngsters, so it's okay.

189
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,970
You old-timer!

190
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:00,887
Huh?

191
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,559
Huh?

192
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,482
Nobu, do you wanna go over there together?

193
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,403
Akane's making a move!

194
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,363
<i>I forgot about this girl.</i>

195
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,323
<i>Was it Akane?</i>

196
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,827
<i>Whether she's there or not,</i>
<i>isn't it the same?</i>

197
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,622
<i>They can kick out Akane,</i>
<i>so please add a new guy member!</i>

198
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,126
"What should I do to stand out?"

199
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,130
Well, that's where you pull
a bad girl move and steal Nobu from Yuki.

200
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,842
If you can do that, your character
will stand out and you'll draw attention.

201
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,303
Of course, that's not a direction
or anything.

202
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,307
But the kids that can do that
are the ones who become popular.

203
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,767
<i>I gotta work harder…</i>

204
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,270
Wow! How pretty!

205
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,857
My big sister's a manicurist,
so I learned this from her.

206
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,275
That's cool.

207
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,152
Akane, I'll do yours too.

208
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,361
Come here.

209
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,280
Uh, okay.

210
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,373
Akane, are you panicking lately?

211
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,087
The series is almost finished,
so I can understand.

212
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,714
It's not exactly like that.

213
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,719
I just want to stand out
to produce results, that's all.

214
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,305
I see.

215
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,434
But I can't let you.

216
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,896
I'm going to fight
for the spotlight myself.

217
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,190
So don't think badly of me.

218
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,822
YUKI LIKE #LOVE_FOR_REAL
"I BET YUKI HAS A GOOD PERSONALITY"

219
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,783
AKANE LIKE #LOVE_FOR_REAL
NO SEARCH RESULTS

220
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,453
<i>I wonder why I'm so different from Yuki.</i>

221
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,165
<i>I need to stand out more than her.</i>

222
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,340
And so then--

223
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,550
Ken!

224
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:05,512
You said you liked Labradors, right?
There's a big one over there!

225
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,013
Oh, seriously?!

226
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,733
<i>I need to work hard and fight.</i>

227
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,571
<i>For the sake of everyone</i>
<i>supporting me too.</i>

228
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,990
-Let's go!
-Stop it!

229
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,664
Clinging to guys so easily!

230
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,541
You play too dirty…

231
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,005
Cut!

232
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,590
We'll stop the shoot once!

233
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:42,966
Get a towel or tissues!

234
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,677
Doing that to a model's face
is a bit much…

235
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,138
She has a magazine shoot tomorrow, right?

236
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:53,059
I… I… didn't mean to… No…

237
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:53,977
Akane.

238
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,895
I…

239
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:55,854
Akane!

240
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,776
I'm okay, so calm down!

241
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,240
I understand, you just panicked.
I know that you're a hard worker, Akane.

242
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,994
You were trying to meet
everyone's expectations

243
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,332
and did something out of your comfort zone
so you got all confused, right?

244
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,713
Sorry… Your face…
And you have a magazine shoot…

245
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,926
Don't worry.

246
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,931
This will be easily erased in Photoshop,
so it won't affect work!

247
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,522
Akane, do you hate me?

248
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,860
I don't hate you.

249
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,906
You're strong and kind, I like you.

250
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,328
Me too. I like you
and your hardworking, earnest self.

251
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,163
That's why I won't get mad.

252
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,831
Really?

253
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,961
The camera isn't rolling,
so there's no point in acting right now.

254
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,758
<i>If this were school,</i>

255
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,720
<i>arguing a little and making up</i>
<i>would be a common story.</i>

256
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,474
<i>But even if the conflict is resolved</i>
<i>amongst themselves…</i>

257
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,934
AKANE WHO LAID A HAND ON YUKI…

258
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,353
AKANE KUROKAWA

259
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,938
AKANE MUST BE WORSE OFF CAMERA…

260
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,272
SHE NEEDS TO BE ARRESTED…

261
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,399
THE DULL GIRL EMERGES…

262
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,566
I KNEW SHE WAS CRAZY…

263
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,526
AKANE'S DONE THIS BEFORE…

264
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,443
SHE'S SO TRASHY LOL

265
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,197
<i>…the internet won't allow it.</i>

266
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,199
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING!

POST YOUR REVIEW
BY TWEETING #LOVE_FOR_REAL

268
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,787
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

269
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,288
DON'T EVER SHOW YOUR FACE AGAIN.

270
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,581
WHY DID THE SHOW USE HER?

271
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,666
WHO'S AKANE AGAIN? LOL

272
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,709
THE WORST ON THE SHOW.

273
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:41,835
PLEASE QUIT ALREADY.

274
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,505
<i>"I knew it," is what I thought.</i>

275
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,468
<i>I thought I'd be forgiven</i>
<i>if I apologized properly.</i>

276
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,469
I AM TRULY SORRY…

277
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,346
<i>Due to my contract with the show,</i>

278
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,141
<i>I can't say anything about</i>
<i>things that weren't filmed,</i>

279
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:01,146
<i>but if I just explain</i>
<i>as much as I can and apologize…</i>

280
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,648
<i>But that triggered it.</i>

281
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,483
<i>-You make me want to puke.</i>
<i>-Be sorry you were born.</i>

282
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,694
<i>-Aren't you ashamed to be alive?</i>
<i>-You think an apology is enough?</i>

283
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,655
<i>Mem told me before…</i>

284
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,616
People gang up on those who apologize.

285
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,829
"If you apologize, you admit
that you did something bad, right?"

286
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,541
"We can punish you
if you did something bad."

287
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,084
That's what they think.

288
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,504
While apologizing is the ethically
correct choice as a Japanese person,

289
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,507
it's the absolute worst thing
you could do in response to backlash.

290
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,634
REPENT BY DYING

291
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,929
<i>I did something bad, so I deserve it.</i>

292
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:39,809
<i>This is everyone's opinion…</i>
<i>I shouldn't look away from it.</i>

293
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,606
<i>I even looked through</i>
<i>the criticisms as much as possible.</i>

294
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,694
<i>Backlash is something</i>
<i>that hits the serious people harder.</i>

295
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,238
<i>They shouldn't even look</i>
<i>at the criticisms.</i>

296
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:56,451
<i>But they try to earnestly accept</i>
<i>everyone's opinion head-on.</i>

297
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,957
<i>When I close my eyes, I can't think</i>
<i>of anything but the backlash.</i>

298
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:09,089
<i>So I tell myself that it'll calm down</i>
<i>by morning and force myself to sleep.</i>

299
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,760
<i>But there's no way that would happen.</i>

300
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,679
Akane, are you okay?

301
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,723
You look pale.

302
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,391
I'm fine.

303
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,727
You want to stay home tomorrow?

304
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,146
I'm fine, I'll go to school.

305
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,279
You see Akane's news?

306
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,949
Isn't it crazy? I knew
she'd do something like this one day.

307
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,036
She always acts like a celebrity,
saying she has work and stuff.

308
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,997
Does she always have to act
like she's better than us?

309
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,666
Such an ugly personality.

310
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,878
She always gives off this vibe like,
"I'm different from all of you."

311
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,631
I bet her posse of guys
are soothing her now.

312
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,341
I bet.

313
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,732
Akane, you seem down lately.
Is something wrong?

314
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,110
Did something happen at work?

315
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,444
No.

316
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:19,200
<i>These trashy hoes are born because</i>
<i>their moms don't teach them anything.</i>

317
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,410
<i>It's a cycle!</i>

318
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,872
<i>I'm sorry, Mom…</i>

319
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:27,876
<i>For now, it's probably best</i>
<i>to not tweet anything right now.</i>

320
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:33,590
<i>Anything you say will just fuel the fire.</i>
<i>If you want to post something, tell me.</i>

321
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,554
<i>When a new episode released, I didn't have</i>
<i>the energy to check the comments.</i>

322
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:45,685
<i>But after seeing the backlash</i>
<i>reignite like before,</i>

323
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,104
<i>I was able to guess what they'd said.</i>

324
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:54,277
<i>And I also figured this will never settle</i>
<i>as long as this show is popular,</i>

325
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,740
<i>and that it's a problem that will haunt me</i>
<i>for the rest of my showbiz career.</i>

326
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,332
<i>I know her from a long time ago,</i>

327
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,793
<i>but she thinks she's different</i>
<i>from everyone else around her.</i>

328
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,339
<i>She probably believes</i>
<i>she's a genius or something.</i>

329
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,342
<i>I doubt she would ever think</i>
<i>about the pain of others.</i>

330
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,720
<i>Those goody-goody moves are</i>
<i>all just an act too, right?</i>

331
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,640
<i>I'm sure she's just partying</i>
<i>with guys in secret</i>

332
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,600
<i>and never working that seriously.</i>

333
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,937
<i>She always has a face on</i>
<i>like she's the center of the world.</i>

334
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,523
<i>I bet she's just a rich kid anyway,</i>
<i>she's never suffered any hardships.</i>

335
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,984
<i>Is there anyone who likes this brat?</i>

336
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,029
<i>These types of kids are useless</i>
<i>no matter what they do.</i>

337
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,405
<i>I bet she doesn't have friends.</i>

338
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,826
<i>You can tell how shallow she is</i>
<i>since she can't get along with others.</i>

339
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,080
<i>She's an idiot who doesn't think</i>
<i>about consequences.</i>

340
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,831
<i>She's always surrounded by guys</i>

341
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,085
<i>and throws a fit</i>
<i>if she doesn't get her way, right?</i>

342
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:56,089
<i>She's probably never dedicated herself</i>
<i>to anything in her life.</i>

343
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,717
<i>I see these types of selfish brats</i>
<i>around me too.</i>

344
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,972
<i>Narcissist. You don't belong anywhere.</i>

345
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:23,741
<i>This Akane who's been getting backlash</i>
<i>is the main cast at Theater Lalalai</i>

346
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,744
<i>and she's a super hard worker.</i>

347
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:30,957
<i>But after seeing this incident, it makes</i>
<i>me feel like everything was faked.</i>

348
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,585
<i>I've been supporting her all this time,</i>
<i>but I can't anymore.</i>

349
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,308
<i>I was Akane's classmate up to middle</i>
<i>school, but everyone seriously hated her.</i>

350
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,769
<i>I hear she messes around</i>
<i>and is a slut too.</i>

351
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,856
<i>She's completely finished as a celebrity.</i>

352
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,775
<i>Nobody would use someone</i>
<i>who'd hit a model's face.</i>

353
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,069
<i>Isn't she ugly too?</i>

354
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,613
<i>She does look like</i>
<i>she has a rotten personality.</i>

355
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:07,577
<i>Bye-bye, Akane.</i>
<i>Too bad we'll never see you on TV anymore.</i>

356
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,538
NAMELESS ANONYMOUS:
SIMPLY PUT, DIE

357
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,960
YOU OKAY? YOU EATING?

358
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,462
EVERYONE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU

359
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,923
<i>Oh yeah, I haven't eaten anything.</i>

360
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,219
I'LL GO BUY SOME FOOD

361
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,846
DON'T GO LOL
A TYPHOON'S COMING LOL

362
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,939
<i>I'm tired.</i>

363
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,531
<i>I'm tired… of thinking.</i>

364
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,458
<i>I don't want to think anymore.</i>

365
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,354
No! Let me go!

366
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,106
Calm down!

367
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,945
I don't mean you any harm.
Please just calm down.

368
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,875
