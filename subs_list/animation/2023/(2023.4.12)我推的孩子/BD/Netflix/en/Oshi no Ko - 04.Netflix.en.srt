1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,813
<i>Due to the rain,</i>
<i>there's even water leaking inside.</i>

2
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,567
<i>Including the marks,</i>
<i>the acting is prearranged.</i>

3
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,445
<i>The places with puddles</i>
<i>are carefully avoided.</i>

4
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,532
<i>I've already confirmed</i>
<i>that during rehearsal too.</i>

5
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:59,537
<i>My entrance, the surrounding set,</i>
<i>camera placement, lighting,</i>

6
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,498
<i>and how I'll appear</i>
<i>in the cutaways and cutbacks.</i>

7
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,377
<i>I have to drill the scene</i>
<i>into my head once more.</i>

8
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,969
We'll resume the shoot now!

9
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,679
The camera's ready to roll.

10
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:17,930
Lighting is ready.

11
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,265
Mic is ready.

12
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,434
Scene 6, shot 51.

13
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,311
Ready, action!

14
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:30,734
<i>The sound of the clapperboard rings</i>
<i>and the camera begins to roll.</i>

15
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,071
<i>The air in the room</i>
<i>becomes thick with tension.</i>

16
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,700
<i>As if a whole year had been condensed,</i>

17
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,161
<i>a heavy yet strong moment begins to pass.</i>

18
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,332
<i>A very long moment,</i>
<i>like my life was being put to the test.</i>

19
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,545
<i>My name is Kana Arima.</i>

20
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,591
<i>I was called a genius when I was little,</i>
<i>and everyone pampered me.</i>

21
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,426
You were on TV again!

22
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,344
Kana, that's amazing!

23
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,554
Thanks.

24
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,556
KANA ARIMA'S GOLDEN AGE

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,974
<i>But…</i>

26
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:06,353
<i>Was it my talent</i>
<i>or was it the public's whim?</i>

27
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,648
<i>Or was more effort needed from me?</i>

28
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,611
<i>People will get tired of anything</i>
<i>if enough time passes.</i>

29
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,448
<i>Today, I am called</i>
<i>"the expired child star" online.</i>

30
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,991
FORMER GENIUS CHILD STAR

31
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,706
<i>It seems I was past my prime</i>
<i>after some point in elementary school,</i>

32
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,834
<i>but I arduously clung on to this industry,</i>

33
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:31,545
<i>and finally grabbed</i>
<i>this long-awaited main role.</i>

34
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,256
<i>I want to make this a good piece</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

35
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,051
<i>I'll grasp at straws</i>
<i>if it's for that purpose.</i>

36
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,010
STRAW?

37
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,512
<i>I know.</i>

38
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,307
<i>I know this is a shitty piece of work.</i>

39
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,935
<i>Acting without basic acting skills.</i>

40
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:50,439
<i>Already four episodes are released,</i>
<i>and most of the audience is disappointed.</i>

41
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,651
<i>It's been branded</i>
<i>with the mark of failure.</i>

42
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,779
<i>But it's not too late.</i>

43
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,782
<i>This part is one</i>
<i>of the original story's best scenes.</i>

44
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,368
<i>The showdown between the hero and stalker.</i>

45
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,497
<i>The girl who has never been loved</i>
<i>is protected for the first time</i>

46
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,957
<i>and sheds tears.</i>

47
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,210
<i>I always cry when I read this part</i>
<i>in the manga.</i>

48
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,171
<i>It's my favorite scene</i>
<i>that I always read over and over.</i>

49
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:20,636
<i>If I can just synchronize with Melt to</i>
<i>back him up and give the best performance,</i>

50
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,221
<i>I'm sure we can still…</i>

51
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,264
Leave me alone!

52
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,432
Stop following me!

53
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,018
That sounds like something you'd do.

54
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,229
<i>Synchronize with him</i>…

55
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,146
But--

56
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,399
I'm not leaving you alone!

57
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,611
<i>This is impossible!</i>
<i>You can't back this guy up!</i>

58
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,323
<i>How can the director and crew think</i>
<i>this acting is okay?!</i>

59
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:47,037
<i>Isn't this supposed to be a more tense,</i>
<i>scary, and dreadful scene?!</i>

60
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,749
<i>Does acting really not matter?</i>

61
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,710
<i>This scene is more…</i>

62
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,974
The mic's picking up
his footsteps from the puddles.

63
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:07,975
Should we stop it?

64
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,101
No.

65
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,396
Let's use it. It sets the mood.

66
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,902
This girl isn't the person
you think she is.

67
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,655
A flirty dude like you won't ever match…

68
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:26,368
<i>Huh… I didn't think he was</i>
<i>that good earlier.</i>

69
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,663
<i>But his acting now seems better</i>
<i>than in the rehearsal.</i>

70
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,083
<i>I don't have talent like Ai.</i>

71
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:38,172
<i>I don't have a captivating aura.</i>
<i>Nor is my acting really good.</i>

72
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,675
<i>That's why, I'll use everything I can.</i>

73
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,055
<i>Props, camera, lighting, actors…</i>

74
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,768
<i>I'll use all that I can to become like Ai.</i>

75
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,067
You know,
your face is really ugly up close.

76
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,320
Is that why you edit your photos?

77
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,572
Huh?

78
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,324
What did you just say?!

79
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,997
Didn't you hear me?

80
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,583
I said that woman is
not even worth protecting!

81
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:19,129
That brat, he's improvising
his lines and ignoring the marks…

82
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,089
Don't stop him.

83
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,842
Follow him with Camera 2.
Make the light stronger too.

84
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,930
She's an important friend of mine!

85
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:28,847
<i>Oh…</i>

86
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,474
<i>It's good.</i>

87
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,477
<i>It looks just like the original story!</i>

88
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,396
<i>This is one of the best scenes</i>
<i>in the manga.</i>

89
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,566
<i>Stage direction, composition, pacing…</i>

90
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,568
<i>everything has a meaning.</i>

91
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:47,032
<i>I was always good at the book reports</i>
<i>where you had to think like the author.</i>

92
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,245
<i>As long as you understand the story,</i>
<i>you can easily get a passing grade.</i>

93
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,414
<i>Here, I set it up for you.</i>

94
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,958
<i>You wanted to do it, right?</i>

95
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,169
<i>Go all out, Kana Arima.</i>

96
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,883
It's useless, no matter what you do!

97
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,971
<i>The highlight of this scene</i>
<i>is when the heroine sheds tears.</i>

98
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,640
<i>Just to make that moment of light shine,</i>

99
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,560
<i>I'm going to act out the darkness.</i>

100
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,149
Just give up and let this happen!

101
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,902
<i>Be scary. Be creepy.</i>

102
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,870
Nobody needs you.

103
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,122
You gotta live life knowing your place!

104
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,124
Quit dreaming!

105
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:42,588
There's nothing good waiting ahead!
Your life's in complete darkness!

106
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,385
<i>And to finish it off…</i>

107
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,263
<i>If Kana Arima can cry well…</i>

108
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,517
Still…

109
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,688
Still, there is light.

110
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,780
<i>Oh yeah, that's her specialty.</i>

111
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,498
My bad.

112
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,251
My fist hit you, right? I tensed up.

113
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,377
No need to apologize.

114
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,172
-I moved to get hit on purpose.
-What?

115
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,717
Nothing beats acting with emotions.

116
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,385
That was good acting.

117
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,347
Thanks to that,
I'm sure Arima got to go all out.

118
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,394
Jeez, that young kid
just messed everything up.

119
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,564
Now, we'll have to adjust
all our staging plans.

120
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,067
Well, it'll be all right.

121
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,027
On a set with lots of child actors,

122
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,571
you usually rewrite the script
while filming anyway.

123
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,784
We're working with young actors,
so this should be expected.

124
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:59,164
Looks like it'll become a good scene.
I'm sure Kana will be happy.

125
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,087
Kana, can you go for the final scene now?

126
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,005
Kana?

127
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,549
Uh, yes!

128
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,009
Scene 7, shot 310.

129
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,637
Ready, action!

130
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,391
FACE OF A GIRL WHO FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER

131
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,530
Good morning!

132
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,366
Uh, if you're gonna sleep,
please go to your bed.

133
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,201
You'll hurt your back.

134
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,164
I'll fall into a deep sleep in my bed,

135
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,835
but I can wake up in about four hours
if I sleep on the floor.

136
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,962
What an unhealthy life hack…

137
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,923
Do you have work for us?

138
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,217
For now, I put directions
for the background

139
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,720
of page 2's cover page
and page 3's panel 1 and 2.

140
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,054
Thank you.

141
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,892
I'll be watching the <i>Mild Today</i> drama,
so let me know when you're almost done.

142
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,146
Oh, you still watch it
on the day a new episode is released?

143
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,814
You two aren't watching it?

144
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,274
Just a little when it began.

145
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,984
I saw up to the second episode.

146
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,695
You've both given up, huh?

147
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,197
You don't have
to force yourself to watch it.

148
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,743
You worked so hard to create this piece,

149
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,079
but they made such a mockery of it
with that drama.

150
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,790
It makes me too angry to watch it.

151
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,294
I already knew from the beginning.

152
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,424
That this is an adaptation of a completed
manga with no future growth in sight.

153
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,177
I should be thankful for it
to have any kind of activity.

154
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,054
I'm in no position to complain.

155
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,308
<i>Any manga artist who's had experience</i>
<i>with adaptations say,</i>

156
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,602
<i>"Don't get your hopes up too high."</i>

157
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:50,359
Every manga artist fantasizes
how nice this and that would be,

158
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,070
but when it's over,
they all have a sad expression.

159
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,741
Adaptations are like that, but…

160
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,203
Still, there is light.

161
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,875
Sensei?

162
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,755
I was able to feel thankful
to have gotten the drama adaptation.

163
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,384
Everybody, watch at least
the last episode!

164
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,802
This is really <i>Mild Today</i>!

165
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,013
ISN'T THE LAST EPISODE GOOD?

166
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,225
<i>The majority of the audience had</i>
<i>already given up</i>

167
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,479
<i>and only core manga fans or fans of</i>
<i>the cast continued to watch the content.</i>

168
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:32,943
<i>The last episode of </i>Mild Today
<i>never went viral or became a hot topic.</i>

169
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,614
<i>But it quietly received praise</i>
<i>from a small community on the internet.</i>

170
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,950
THE LAST EPISODE IS A MASTERPIECE!

171
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,414
"MILD FLAVOR TODAY" WRAP PARTY

172
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,375
Oh, that actor was in this series too?

173
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,585
When I see everyone like this,

174
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,630
it makes me realize
just how many people were involved.

175
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,593
That's right. There are many people's jobs
that are dependent on our acting.

176
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,473
We must achieve good results, so causing
a scandal is out of the question.

177
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,269
By the way,
you got a girlfriend or anything?

178
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,521
I don't, so scandals don't concern me.

179
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,439
I see.

180
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,816
Hmm.

181
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,361
Good work on the filming.

182
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,071
Sensei.

183
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,997
I believe this title was upheld
by your acting skills, Ms. Arima.

184
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,333
Thank you so much.

185
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,299
Especially the last episode.

186
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,844
I wish it became like that earlier, but…

187
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,306
Hey, Aqua.

188
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,808
The last episode had good reviews.

189
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,019
Thank you.

190
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,897
The title was tough profit-wise,

191
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,609
but the goal was to give young talent
like you opportunity.

192
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,069
So I guess
we were able to accomplish that.

193
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,324
<i>After I sent this</i>
<i>producer's cigarette butt to DNA testing,</i>

194
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:07,329
<i>I found out we were complete strangers,</i>
<i>so in a way, that was a relief.</i>

195
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,497
<i>However…</i>

196
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,082
You're with Ichigo Production?

197
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,335
In some way,

198
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,338
you have a similar face to Ai.

199
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,090
Really?

200
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,342
Yeah.

201
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,429
I used to see her face up close,
so there's no mistake there.

202
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,516
"Up close"?

203
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,520
What kind of relation
did you have with Ai?

204
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:36,024
<i>I worked with her when I referred her</i>
<i>to a fashion magazine model job.</i>

205
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,654
<i>After that, not only did I send her jobs,</i>
<i>I took care of her in various aspects.</i>

206
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,114
Like introducing a good client.

207
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,909
Or when she met with a boy
in secret from her agency,

208
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,827
I'd tell her a good restaurant.

209
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,498
Do you know who she was seeing?

210
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,457
Hmm?

211
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,627
Are you perhaps Ai's fan?

212
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,879
You interested in gossip
of late celebrities?

213
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,839
I am.

214
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,967
Then let's see.

215
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:08,515
I don't mind telling you,
but let's make it a deal.

216
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:13,478
Your face is similar to Ai's, it's pretty.

217
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,525
Do you have any interest
in reality dating shows?

218
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,362
Hey.

219
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,281
How much longer, Ruby?

220
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,450
Jeez, just wait a second, Bro!

221
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,453
This uniform is cute
but difficult to put on.

222
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,789
But it sure is cute!

223
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,750
Don't make us late on the first day.

224
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,004
Isn't your skirt too short?

225
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,173
Bro, you've always sounded
like an old geezer.

226
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,884
Oh yeah!

227
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,137
Mama, we'll be off now.

228
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,645
CONGRATULATIONS
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

229
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,650
Uh, the next three years, you must all…

230
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,196
Was entertainment course Class F?

231
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,407
Yup. Let's go to class halfway together!

232
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,827
Congratulations on being admitted, Aqua.

233
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:11,995
And Ruby.

234
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,375
This Youtou High School's class days
are flexible compared to other schools,

235
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,796
but if you get bad grades or
have bad attendance, you'll be held back.

236
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,507
There's not much difference
in curriculum either.

237
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,885
But! That boy is an actor.

238
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,096
Those two belong to
a major agency's idol group.

239
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,183
That girl with the huge boobs is
a gravure model.

240
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,354
A voice actor and a streamer…
A fashion model and a singer.

241
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,148
The ones on the bench are
a Kabuki actor and an actress.

242
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,485
Everyone's a celebrity.

243
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:49,115
This is also the high school where
the most entertainers gather in Japan.

244
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,451
I welcome you, underclassmen.

245
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,204
Welcome to the world of show business!

246
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,919
I'm getting nervous!

247
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,462
There's no need to be nervous!

248
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:07,258
This isn't a training school
or a film set, it's just a normal school.

249
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,177
So you just have to act normal.

250
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,686
Wow…

251
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,690
<i>Beauties to my right!</i>

252
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,191
<i>Pretty boys on my left!</i>

253
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,654
<i>This is clearly different</i>
<i>from my local middle school!</i>

254
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:34,452
<i>Although, since I've inherited Mama's</i>
<i>genes, I shouldn't be losing face-wise.</i>

255
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,957
<i>I will not be overwhelmed!</i>

256
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,087
<i>Look at this girl!</i>

257
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,047
STARE

258
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,259
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to stare.

259
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,387
I thought, "There's a major beauty here."

260
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,973
This entertainment course
sure has amazing people.

261
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,642
Well, so are you.

262
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,852
Are you a model?

263
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,771
I am somewhat.

264
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,650
I'm Minami Kotobuki. Nice to meet you.

265
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,819
Minami Kotobuki…

266
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,030
Oh! You're a gravure idol!

267
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,033
Isn't it inhumane to google someone
right in front of them?

268
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,119
Wow, a G cup! How sexy!

269
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,328
Stop!

270
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,540
I never heard real Kansai dialect before!
Are you from Osaka?

271
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,793
No, I was born and raised in Kanagawa.

272
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,629
My dialect is just like… my style?

273
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,548
It's a fake Kansai dialect?!

274
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,342
And just like that,
I became friends with Minami.

275
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,635
What the hell was that?

276
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,471
Hello.

277
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,348
Well, I'm glad you made a friend.

278
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,100
Did you make any friends, Bro?

279
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:45,023
Well, I didn't exactly enter this school
to make friends.

280
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,776
Oh, this is when
they couldn't make friends.

281
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,361
Sorry I asked something cruel.

282
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,947
You don't have to tell me
about class anymore.

283
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,366
I have people to chat with at least!

284
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,369
Guys don't establish friendships
immediately.

285
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,247
My course is available
from middle school unlike yours.

286
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:05,418
Most friendships are already established,
so it takes time to make new ones.

287
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,338
It's not like I'm a loner on my first day.
Understand?

288
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,049
Aqua's talking a lot more than usual…

289
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,719
Minami, could you be friends
with Aqua too?

290
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,721
Sure thing.

291
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,515
Don't pass around your friends.

292
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,851
Forget me, just worry about yourself.

293
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,145
Your class is special,
so it must be different.

294
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,439
That's true.

295
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:30,902
When I think about how everyone around me
is a pro too, it makes me nervous.

296
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,654
There's no need to be nervous!

297
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:37,242
This isn't a training school
or a film set, it's just a normal school.

298
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,910
So you just have to act normal.

299
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,578
Ruby…

300
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,164
I heard this same exact line somewhere.

301
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,251
Well, from the looks
of the entrance ceremony,

302
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:51,297
there were many good-looking students,
but I barely saw any in the media.

303
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,174
So you don't need to get nervous.

304
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,551
No…

305
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,554
There was an incredible person.

306
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,725
Now, learning materials and the sort
will be sold after this…

307
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,103
I apologize.

308
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,690
I had a promo today
on a live show this morning.

309
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,568
I wanted to at least attend
the entrance ceremony, but…

310
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,528
Frill Shiranui…

311
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,738
That's Frill Shiranui…

312
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,494
Frill Shiranui was here!

313
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,955
She's a hit on that Monday night drama!

314
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,833
A multitalented entertainer
who can sing, dance and act!

315
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,042
When you say "beauty,"

316
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,379
Frill Shiranui is the first person
who comes to anyone's mind!

317
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:36,009
Of course I know of her, but I never knew
you were obsessed with her.

318
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,468
She's my most fave now.

319
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:38,887
Hmm.

320
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,140
"Hmm"? It's<i> the </i>Frill Shiranui!

321
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,391
Not interested.

322
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,769
My most fave has always been
and will always be Ai.

323
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,856
Well, same for me, but…

324
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,233
That's different from this!

325
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,195
Oh! Look, there's the real thing!

326
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,531
Ah, she's so cute even from a distance!

327
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,158
Seriously, you're just a fan.

328
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,701
You're her classmate, right?

329
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,453
But…

330
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,370
Huh?

331
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,873
Hello, Ms. Shiranui.

332
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,752
My sister's in the same class as you.

333
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,462
Please treat her well.

334
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,339
Hey, Bro!

335
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,549
I know you.

336
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,051
Weren't you in <i>Mild Today</i>?

337
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,510
I'm surprised you knew.

338
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,679
It didn't even become that big of a news.

339
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,807
It was talked about on set
the other day, so I watched it.

340
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:26,768
It was good.

341
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,479
Thanks.

342
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,775
I've seen you on the cover
of <i>Mid Jump </i>magazine<i> </i>before.

343
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,068
Was it Ms. Minami?

344
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:35,985
Yes!

345
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:37,654
<i>Wow…</i>

346
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,115
<i>They're both being acknowledged</i>
<i>by Frill Shiranui!</i>

347
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,076
And you are…

348
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,327
Um…

349
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,413
I'm sorry, but what do you do?

350
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,791
I'm, um…

351
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,752
doing nothing at the moment…

352
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,962
I see.

353
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,546
Um…

354
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:56,965
Do your best?

355
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:01,970
Miyaemon! Make me into an idol already!

356
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,596
Don't rush me.

357
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:08,101
We can't set up an audition right away
because we want to make an idol group.

358
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,103
But at this rate…

359
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,231
That girl doesn't really have any work.

360
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,857
What? She's just a commoner.

361
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,443
There's a commoner mixed in here.

362
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,362
What a troublesome celebrity fan.

363
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,115
I'll get bullied at this rate!

364
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:27,787
To make a proper group, we need to hire
a talent scout and undergo proper steps.

365
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,498
Besides, you can't find
cute girls that easily.

366
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:35,211
Most of the ambitious girls are taken
by the major agency auditions too.

367
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:40,341
There's this cute girl with giant boobs
called Minami Kotobuki in my class.

368
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,677
She's in another agency. No!

369
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,471
Maybe if she was a freelancer.

370
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,890
But I don't want any trouble
between agencies.

371
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,104
If you want a freelancer, you know one.

372
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,567
A freelancer who barely has any work
despite being well-known

373
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,278
<i>and has a cute face.</i>

374
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:40,878
