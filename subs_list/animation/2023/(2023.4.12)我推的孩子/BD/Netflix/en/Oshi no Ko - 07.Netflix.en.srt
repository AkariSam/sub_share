1
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,068
No! Let me go!

2
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,528
Calm down!

3
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,367
I don't mean you any harm.
Please just calm down.

4
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,872
Aqua… how come?

5
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,210
<i>Mem said you went out in the typhoon,</i>

6
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,380
<i>but you wouldn't return,</i>
<i>so she's looking around for you.</i>

7
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,883
So I was following the route
to the convenience store.

8
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:14,885
You idiot.

9
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,642
Hey, you two!

10
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,145
That was dangerous earlier!

11
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,147
What are you guys doing?!

12
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,779
Akane Kurokawa's getting roasted.

13
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,949
Well, with that incident,
it's no surprise.

14
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:41,745
Don't you get used to this type of thing
once you're a public figure?

15
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,080
More or less.

16
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:47,042
But it depends on the person,
so some people never get used to it.

17
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,461
Even for me,

18
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:53,799
depending on my mental state, there are
days when I think of actually dying too.

19
00:02:54,842 --> 00:03:00,848
The mind of a teenage girl receiving
a storm of criticism for the first time

20
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,559
must be something unimaginable for you.

21
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,564
It's enough to make you believe
that your life is over.

22
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:14,695
Reality dating shows are popular
in countries all over the world,

23
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,032
but it's produced
nearly 50 suicides up to now.

24
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:23,287
Depending on the country, counseling
for the cast is mandatory by law.

25
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,959
If 50 people are dead, then you should
think there are ten times more than that

26
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:33,339
who have thought of committing suicide,
but barely escaped death.

27
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,635
Reality shows are a program
where you expose your true self.

28
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,055
The one who gets slammed is yourself,
not the show.

29
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,848
Of course that's tough.

30
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:48,312
My brother said, "Lies are also
the best way to protect yourself."

31
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,564
That's well put.

32
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,818
It's good if you created a persona
to some degree,

33
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,239
but the more you show your true self,
the damage is deeper.

34
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,660
<i>Social media makes the slander</i>
<i>toward celebrities visible.</i>

35
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,204
<i>By freedom of expression</i>
<i>and in the name of justice,</i>

36
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,499
<i>someone is getting lynched</i>
<i>every day somewhere.</i>

37
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,919
Everyone thinks of themselves
as an exception,

38
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,338
but they are in fact cornering someone.

39
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,758
Your casual remark can kill people.

40
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,428
I wonder if Bro is okay.

41
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,597
Even if you're careful, it's useless.

42
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:31,438
Like they say,
"Everyone has their quirks."

43
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,857
Every person has some kind of flaw.

44
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,694
We all possess fuel to spark controversy.

45
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,199
Yes. That's correct.

46
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,452
What? Is that true?

47
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,579
Yes. I'll be over right away.

48
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,833
Is something wrong, CEO?

49
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,792
Aqua…

50
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,923
seems to be in trouble
with the police right now.

51
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,174
What?!

52
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,473
My daughter told me
not to watch the program,

53
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,767
and I'm not familiar with the internet.

54
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,979
I never knew she was in such a situation.

55
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,064
Why didn't you tell me?

56
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:18,694
Because I didn't want to worry you!

57
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,786
When I was called,
I prepared myself for the worst.

58
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,832
But good job, Aqua. I'm proud of you.

59
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,253
You look uninterested in others,
but you're watching over people.

60
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,547
It's not like that.

61
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,176
People can die easily.

62
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,597
If someone screams for help, you gotta
move quickly or it'll be too late.

63
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,561
But I'll charge Akane
for the taxi fare later.

64
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,563
You're cheap.

65
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,400
Akane!

66
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,115
You idi…

67
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,576
Why did you make us worry?

68
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,705
Why?! Why didn't you talk to us?!

69
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,623
Sorry…

70
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,541
Akane.

71
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,419
What do you wanna do from here?

72
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,004
What do I wanna do?

73
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,966
I'm saying you have an option
to quit the show this way.

74
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,346
But what about the contract and stuff?

75
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,557
This is an issue that questions
the supervisory responsibility

76
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,102
of the program that uses minors.

77
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:37,523
Now that it's reached this point, they
wouldn't complain if you wanted to quit.

78
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,902
You're exposing your real name,
Akane Kurokawa, on the show.

79
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,030
You decide where to draw the line.

80
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,831
I've been working hard all this time
to become more famous as an actress

81
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,084
and to continue acting.

82
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,588
Everyone's helped me out so much too…

83
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,716
But it ended up like this.

84
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,093
Akane…

85
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,845
I'm scared…

86
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,181
I'm really scared…

87
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,603
But I'm gonna continue.

88
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,565
I don't wanna quit like this!

89
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,817
Alright.

90
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,862
You heard her. There's no problems, right?

91
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,280
Of course.

92
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,532
That's what we've been saying
from the start.

93
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,201
We'll try to back you up
as much as possible too.

94
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,496
You all get along on this set.

95
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,458
Well, this set's entire cast is
around the same age.

96
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,711
I'm sure everyone's going to work together

97
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,755
and go through with the show
despite what's being said.

98
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,427
But this leaves a bad aftertaste.

99
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:55,225
<i>The show that fueled the fire and those</i>
<i>online who said whatever they wanted</i>…

100
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,978
they all piss me off.

101
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,980
PRESS CLUB

102
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,983
<i>The police station has something</i>
<i>called a press club.</i>

103
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:09,531
<i>Various media journalists stand by</i>
<i>24 hours to pick up the latest news</i>

104
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,368
<i>and they're all waiting eagerly</i>
<i>for a scoop.</i>

105
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,870
TEENAGE ACTRESS ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

106
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,998
Now you've gone and done it…

107
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,375
I was a fool for complimenting you.

108
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,337
I hope you know where this is going.

109
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,715
Yeah, although I don't know
if it'll go well.

110
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,427
Now this is where
the real reality show begins.

111
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,348
<i>The news of Akane's</i>
<i>suicide attempt spread,</i>

112
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,351
<i>and it sparked various debates</i>
<i>in the community.</i>

113
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,020
<i>Of course there were those who backed off,</i>

114
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,105
<i>but new disputes</i>
<i>and slander increased too.</i>

115
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,943
It gained attention,
but there's no net positive outcome.

116
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,613
This kind of thing just isn't a good
countermeasure against backlash.

117
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:54,826
<i>In fact, Akane Kurokawa</i>
<i>is still on hiatus right now,</i>

118
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,870
<i>and she has no plans of returning yet.</i>

119
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,289
You selfish child.

120
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,334
Can you take responsibility
for making this a big issue?

121
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,379
I don't think this is a bad bet.

122
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,883
The amount of attention is the same
as the poker chips on the table.

123
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:15,138
If she folds now, Akane will lose big
without having put up a fight.

124
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,641
You can't win if you don't raise.

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,144
I still bet even if I have only one ace.

126
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,899
Real life is nothing like poker.

127
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:30,654
What? You want videos and pictures
with everyone in it?

128
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,992
But I don't have that many.
Maybe only 100 or less.

129
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,410
You've got a ton.

130
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,203
What do you wanna use it for?

131
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,914
<i>Love For Real</i>
is content edited by a pro, right?

132
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:46,420
<i>So there's an intent there to make Akane</i>
<i>the villain to make the show interesting.</i>

133
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:51,091
<i>If you just cut out parts of a story</i>
<i>and patch it together,</i>

134
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,135
<i>even a saint can look like a criminal.</i>

135
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,178
<i>That's what staging does.</i>

136
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,933
I have the filmmaking skills,
so if I just have the materials…

137
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,810
I see.

138
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:06,189
In other words, you want to make
a <i>Love For Real</i> in our own perspective.

139
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,360
Whose advice was that?
Did you think of it yourself?

140
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,279
Hm? I did.

141
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,158
Really, that's not a bad idea.

142
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,912
This situation now
in advertising agency terms is called

143
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:25,959
"A situation with many active viewers
where many impressions can be expected."

144
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,254
Akane's backlash stands out
at first glance,

145
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,590
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

146
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,510
In reality, that's only a small percentage
of the viewers.

147
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,013
The sensitive topic of attempted suicide…

148
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,808
Most of the audience are wondering
if they should support or criticize.

149
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,769
They're the silent majority.

150
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,772
In other words,
many users are looking for an answer.

151
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,859
That's where you provide
a highly relatable opinion,

152
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,780
then most people will believe
that's what's correct in this market.

153
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,283
We're the focus of attention right now,

154
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,453
so we might be able to
completely overwrite public opinion.

155
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:05,916
And we have the access to upload
your video to the official accounts too.

156
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,834
The user flow is secured.

157
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:11,588
Depending on the video's quality,
we can expect it to go super viral.

158
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,217
Once it's finished, gimme the data!
I'll upload it!

159
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,802
Well, I could do that much--

160
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:21,723
Do you know which day and time
is best to upload to get the most retweets

161
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,560
and how many characters in a post
gives the highest impressions?

162
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,645
No…

163
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,982
I came this far through online marketing
and self-promoting, you know?

164
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,986
I may not look it,
but I'm a pro at making content go viral.

165
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,407
Hm. Then I'll provide the music.

166
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,409
You can do that?

167
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:45,038
Well, I am a pro who belongs
to a record label, living off music.

168
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:50,252
I write the songs for my band
and offer music to others too.

169
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,588
I just gotta make
some teary emotional songs, right?

170
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,506
Piece of cake!

171
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,966
Whoa.

172
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,885
But you know,
don't we want that one scene?

173
00:11:58,969 --> 00:11:59,970
Which scene?

174
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:05,225
You know, the scene where Akane hit me
and I kindly hugged her!

175
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,104
Ah! Oh, but the camera
wasn't rolling there--

176
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,480
Don't underestimate me.

177
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:15,944
<i>You think a pro model like me wouldn't</i>
<i>take notice of the static camera position?</i>

178
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,739
<i>I put us in a position</i>
<i>that'd make us perfectly appear on camera.</i>

179
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,367
So much for a natural reaction…

180
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:27,622
The staff definitely has the footage.
They're hiding it on purpose!

181
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,583
It's so unfair!

182
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,131
Well, yeah, we do have it.

183
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,510
But it's prohibited to carry out
video data. I can't lend it to you.

184
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,012
That's true.

185
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,055
If that gets out,

186
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,894
it's like admitting the show set up
a cast member to look like a villain.

187
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,399
If that happens while we're attracting
this much attention,

188
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,153
Akane's bashing may shift
towards the show.

189
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,280
You catch on quick.

190
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,826
What we're doing is a form
of entertainment known as a reality show.

191
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,788
Everyone watches the show
looking forward to the real drama.

192
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,584
<i>We don't force anything onto Akane.</i>

193
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,461
<i>She makes the decisions,</i>

194
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>and we're just staging it</i>
<i>so that the audience easily understands.</i>

195
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,635
If she refused the job,
we wouldn't have used her either.

196
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,011
Am I wrong?

197
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,472
Akane has
a highly responsible personality.

198
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,309
I know, I've been filming her.

199
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,812
<i>Akane is a pro,</i>
<i>but we're also doing this as a profession.</i>

200
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:34,814
A pro, huh…

201
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,609
Director, how old are you?

202
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,069
I'm 35.

203
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,820
Akane's 17.

204
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,574
<i>Whether she's a pro or not,</i>

205
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,827
<i>a 17-year-old is just a damn brat</i>
<i>who makes a bunch of mistakes.</i>

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,336
If the grown-ups won't protect the kids,
then who will?

207
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,305
You got a point there.

208
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,142
Ugh, no, no!

209
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,729
Make that shot long, so it'll look more
like an amateur worked on it!

210
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,273
This is where you add my song!

211
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,983
Make it go "Bang!"

212
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,651
Shut up…

213
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,321
The staff gave me this photo!

214
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,365
Awesome! Let's use it!

215
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,533
Um, the composition…

216
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,035
Nice!

217
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,038
Looks real nice!

218
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:49,180
Come on, Director, it finished encoding.
We're gonna post it.

219
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,934
Damn it, that computer
has some good specs.

220
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,728
Let me sleep more…

221
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,147
I wonder how many views it'll get.

222
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,774
I hope it hits at least 5,000.

223
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,902
Even that's pretty hard.

224
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,655
The videos you put more effort into
don't take off as expected sometimes.

225
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,200
If we can get 100 retweets
in the first minute,

226
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,454
it should ultimately
become a pretty viral video.

227
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,371
A hundred?

228
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:17,334
Well, we did all that we could.
Now, let's go for the showdown!

229
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,461
You haven't done anything though.

230
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,379
Why are you acting like the leader?

I understand, you just panicked.

240
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,997
Sorry… Your face…
And you have a magazine shoot…

241
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,499
Don't worry.

242
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,251
<i>Akane, do you hate me?</i>

243
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,419
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

244
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,006
<i>You're strong and kind, I like you.</i>

245
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,512
<i>Me too. I like you</i>
<i>and your hardworking, earnest self.</i>

<i>This video received</i>
<i>74,000 retweets 24 hours later.</i>

248
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,784
<i>It revamped Akane Kurokawa's image,</i>

249
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,287
<i>as well as established </i>Love For Real<i>'s</i>
<i>popularity at the same time.</i>

250
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,039
THE CAST IS CLOSE…

251
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,290
YUKI DOESN'T WANT BASHING…

252
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,376
IT'S TRENDY TO SLAM THE SHOW NOW? LOL

253
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,293
ALL AT ONCE TOO

254
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:47,007
<i>The backlash had settled to some degree.</i>

255
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,884
<i>Why I word that vaguely is because</i>

256
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,887
<i>there is no complete solution to backlash.</i>

257
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,139
Akane!

258
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,101
<i>I'm sure this matter will continue</i>
<i>to be brought up again,</i>

259
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,895
<i>and even a decade later,</i>
<i>there will be those who mention it.</i>

260
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:05,900
But… Yeah,
I'll return starting the next shoot.

261
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,360
I'm so glad!

262
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,654
But don't push yourself to go on the show.

263
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,782
Uh, that wasn't meant in a bad way, okay?

264
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,910
Since I want you to go on the show
even if you pushed yourself!

265
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:16,911
I know.

266
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,125
I feel that it's become a difficult world
to voice your opinion.

267
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,503
I bet I would've gotten backlash for it
if I tweeted that now.

268
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,338
I seriously gotta be careful.

269
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,176
From now on, maybe you should
create a bit of a persona?

270
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,096
If you show your true self,
it'll hit you harder if you get slammed.

271
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,097
A persona?

272
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,015
That's true…

273
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,186
If you act out some kind of role,
that'll become your armor.

274
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,064
If you expose your true self,
you just get hurt.

275
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,567
This isn't exactly limited
to reality shows either.

276
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,403
It's a vital concept in socializing too.

277
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,073
Since Aqua's a man of many faces too, so…

278
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,742
You can show us more
of yourself, you know?

279
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:56,910
I refuse.

280
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,081
I'm good at acting, so maybe I'll try it.

281
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,917
That's right,
you <i>are</i> an actress after all, Akane.

282
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,419
Rather, that's the only strength I have…

283
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,256
But what kind of role should I act out?

284
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,549
Hmm.

285
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,844
Aqua, what kind of girl is your type?

286
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,012
Why me?

287
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,931
Because you're the only guy here.

288
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,683
Tell her what your ideal girl is like.

289
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,769
Ideal…

290
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,483
A girl with a pretty face.

291
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,776
Ugh, that's the worst.

292
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,986
You are the epitome of lookism.

293
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,656
With a bright smile like sunshine.

294
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,616
A perfect performance.

295
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,493
An invincible manner and speech.

296
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,120
Huh?

297
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,999
<i>Natural captivating eyes.</i>

298
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,544
You say some difficult stuff.

299
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,254
That's vague…

300
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,507
Hmm, but maybe it's like her?

301
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,634
Maybe like B Komachi's Ai?

302
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,471
Ai as in the idol
who died a long time ago?

303
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,389
Uh-huh.

304
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,890
Am I wrong?

305
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,143
Uh, well, that's about right.

306
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,645
Ah, so you like these types!

307
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,730
You're a sucker for pretty faces!

308
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,404
I'll try acting out
Aqua's type of girl then.

309
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,698
Do it!

310
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,491
Make Aqua fall for you!

311
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,450
Yeah!

312
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:24,706
<i>No one can copy Ai.</i>
<i>She's a natural-born star.</i>

313
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,170
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

314
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:35,466
<i>Aqua worked hard</i>
<i>to make that video for me.</i>

315
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,262
<i>He also came to find me in a storm.</i>

316
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,472
<i>That made me happy.</i>

317
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,642
<i>I need to repay him.</i>

318
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:49,856
<i>I wonder if he'll be happy</i>
<i>if I act out his type and showed him.</i>

319
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,195
<i>B Komachi's Ai… I need to gather data.</i>

320
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,868
Her main trait must be those eyes.

321
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,120
Did it come from self-confidence?

322
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,038
NATURAL CAPTIVATING EYES

323
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,041
If so, that means her desire
for recognition was being satisfied.

324
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,043
Her social life seems limited.

325
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,546
But I'm sure there was something
with the opposite sex…

326
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,423
Was her home environment good?

327
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,385
No, this personality probably developed
from a very bad one.

328
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,305
It seems she had some type of bias
towards the way she loved others.

329
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,599
Secretive but desired exposure.

330
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,935
A perfectionist despite being reckless.

331
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,811
Careless but overly persistent.

332
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,939
The type to save money.

333
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,690
Rather disinterested in fashion.

334
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,733
Good vision.

335
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,318
Sensitive ears and nose.

336
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,569
Long steps when walking.

337
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,238
Relatively poorly educated.

338
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,073
A crooked way of holding chopsticks.

339
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,991
Signs of developmental disorder.

340
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,703
An unbalance seen in girls who've had
intercourse at the adolescent stage.

341
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:57,215
From around 15 years old, you can see
an improvement in her reckless behavior.

342
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,971
I wonder if she met someone nice?

343
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,055

00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:08,142
Akane Kurokawa went through a disaster.
Does she seem okay?

345
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,603
Yeah, she recovered somehow.

346
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,604
I see.

347
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,359
Aww, I wish she had just retired.

348
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,610
Hey…

349
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,697
Oh! No, no, that's not what I meant!

350
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,365
As a business rival!

351
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,996
Ugh, a bad choice of words can be scary.
That would've blown up if I tweeted that.

352
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,916
Even as a business rival,
that doesn't make it sound any better.

353
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,753
Well, as someone who's the same age
with the same job as an actress…

354
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,340
she's like an eyesore.

355
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,760
You can understand
when you want your rival to fall, right?

356
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,515
It's basically Schadenfreude.

357
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,768
Kana Arima feels that way
toward Akane Kurokawa?

358
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,520
Well of course.

359
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,735
Right. You had no interest in theater.

360
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,778
Well, you only act in front of a camera.

361
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,533
<i>Akane Kurokawa of Theater Lalalai</i>

362
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,662
<i>is famous in the theater world</i>
<i>for being a genius actress.</i>

363
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,586
Akane will return starting today.

364
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,924
Everyone, I apologize
for causing so much trouble.

365
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,761
I'd like to make up for it
with my efforts from here.

366
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,512
I kindly ask for your cooperation!

367
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,267
Now then, please stand by for the camera.

368
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:33,811
Let's go.

369
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:35,772
Yeah.

370
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,776
Sure, Aqua.

371
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,290
I'm so sleepy! This shoot is too early.

372
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,293
Oh, is the camera rolling already?

373
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,800
Tee-hee!

374
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:39,854
