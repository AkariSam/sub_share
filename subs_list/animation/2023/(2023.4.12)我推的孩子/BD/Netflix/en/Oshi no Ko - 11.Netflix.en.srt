1
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,891
Nice job!

2
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,893
What should we do after this?

3
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,853
Hmm, I guess I'll go home.

4
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,939
Oh, what about you, Mana?

5
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,693
I saw a cutie at the dressing room booths,
so I think I'll go see her!

6
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,030
You sure do like the cute ones.

7
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,824
Such an otaku.

8
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,827
Which stage?

9
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,537
Star Stage.

10
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,622
Ah, that hellhole.

11
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,875
It's so hot there.

12
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:09,797
Hey, Boss, can we stay
and watch the next stage too?

13
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,674
Mem-cho's performing.

14
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,677
I've heard of the name. Who is she?

15
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:18,722
She's a streamer. She's cute and funny.

16
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,475
She was on this show called
<i>Love For Real</i> recently.

17
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,686
Ah, the one that received backlash.

18
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,148
That girl joined
this group called B Komachi.

19
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,649
B Komachi?

20
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,733
You've heard of it?

21
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,321
I guess kids nowadays don't know.

22
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,533
They inherited the name of an old group.

23
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,327
<i>There was this legendary girl
called Ai in it.</i>

24
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:50,838
She was just amazing,
but she died midway through her career.

25
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,008
But even if they have the same group name...

26
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,969
Well, let's just watch a little
before we leave.

27
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,310
B Komachi, you're on.

28
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,020
Okay!

29
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,734
B KOMACHI

30
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,450
<i>The size of the crowd isn't bad.</i>

31
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,120
<i>I wasn't too worried
since we have an influencer in our group.</i>

32
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,082
<i>But also many red penlights stand out
more than I thought.</i>

33
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,045
My penlight color will be red!

34
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,129
The same color as Ai's!

35
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,591
Then I guess I'll be yellow.

36
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,009
And you, <i>Senpai</i>?

37
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,637
Oh. Hmm...

38
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,848
If anything's okay, white.

39
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,142
White, huh...

40
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,019
Oh, is that not allowed?

41
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,190
It is allowed, but some girls see it
as special and unfair,

42
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,858
so they tend to argue about it.

43
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,652
Really...

44
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:55,569
Why not?

45
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,406
Since you're not an idol otaku,
it's very like you.

46
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,967
B Komachi!

47
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,690
<i>I'm fine.</i>

48
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,735
<i>Once I get up on stage,
I'm not really nervous.</i>

49
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,698
<i>The customers in the front
are mostly waving yellow lights.</i>

50
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,575
<i>Our customers are mainly here for Mem-cho.</i>

51
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,577
<i>Everyone's here so they can see her.</i>

52
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:53,043
<i>I'm sure the customers would've been
happier if she was the center.</i>

53
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,262
What do you think
as an OG B Komachi otaku?

54
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,725
They're completely different.
This isn't B Komachi.

55
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:11,478
That group was upheld by a star called Ai.

56
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,522
Just gathering three amateurs...

57
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,212
Boss?!

58
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,513
<i>Oh, this girl is so bright.</i>

59
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,098
Thank you so much!

60
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,602
<i>She loves idols and she's always upbeat.</i>

61
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,314
<i>It's like she was born to become an idol.</i>

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,027
<i>Even at this very second,
she's grabbing someone's heart</i>

63
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,112
<i>and she's gaining more fans.</i>

64
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,240
<i>These are the girls who rise to the top.</i>

65
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,243
Next up is that megahit song
you've all been waiting for!

66
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,246
"Sign is B!"

67
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,748
<i>I envy them.</i>

68
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,543
<i>For being watched over
and desired by everyone.</i>

69
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,923
<i>There's no one who'll look at me.</i>

70
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,886
<i>My mom and my manager neglected me.</i>

71
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,349
<i>Even our fans only see
the old child star in me.</i>

72
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,394
<i>"Somebody, please look at me."</i>

73
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,607
<i>That's all I've been screaming
for the past dozen years.</i>

74
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,777
<i>"Please say that you need me."</i>

75
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:46,907
<i>If you just tell me that,
I'll work as hard as I possibly can.</i>

76
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,618
<i>"Say that you can use me."</i>

77
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,162
<i>Then I'll work like a dog for you.</i>

78
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,665
<i>"Tell me that I did a good job."</i>

79
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,835
<i>Then I'll work even harder.</i>

80
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,755
<i>Somebody...</i>

81
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,925
<i>Tell me that I belong here!</i>

82
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,564
<i>He's so stupid!</i>

83
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:21,191
<i>What's he doing
while keeping a straight face?!</i>

84
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,819
<i>He even bothered to wave
all three of our color lights.</i>

85
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,613
<i>Does this mean he's a fan
of every member? You cheater!</i>

86
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,283
<i>I've made up my mind.</i>

87
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:34,621
<i>While I'm an idol, I swear
I'll turn all of your lights white.</i>

88
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,876
<i>I'll make you love me.</i>

89
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:42,045
<i>I'll become your favorite!</i>

90
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,690
Boss, isn't that girl nice too?

91
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,193
Her expression has been getting better
since the first song.

92
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,903
I can honestly be her fan.

93
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:09,364
All three of them have the looks
of an ace idol in other groups.

94
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:13,327
Especially that girl in the center
would be loved by otaku and she can sing.

95
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,621
They might get popular.

96
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,881
I'm so tired!

97
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,384
Oh, Bro, you were here?

98
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,928
Well, yeah.

99
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,515
By the way, what was that back there?
I couldn't stop myself from laughing!

100
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,094
How was our performance?

101
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,058
Well, I guess you guys did good
for your first time.

102
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,144
What? Compliment us some more!

103
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,396
I can't do that.

104
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:27,276
Since you guys are going to do bigger
and better concerts from here.

105
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:31,572
Considering that, it's a waste
to give you guys a high score now.

106
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,492
Is that so.

107
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,080
Those two finally decided
to talk to each other.

108
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,708
They don't seem like they get along.

109
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,669
It's not what you think.

110
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,466
Hey Aqua, are you doing well
with Akane from <i>Love For Real</i>?

111
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,679
No, I haven't seen her since the party.

112
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,472
Really?

113
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,808
Well, she's just
a work colleague after all.

114
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,104
But we're talking about going to take
photos together to post on Instagram.

115
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,523
Work...

116
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,319
That's right!

117
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,114
That Akane Kurokawa would never get
serious over someone like you!

118
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,284
It's all an act for the TV show!
This is pretty common, you know.

119
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,077
Poor you!

120
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,413
You can't take these things seriously!

121
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,415
Oh gosh, are you seriously upset?

122
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,627
Arima, you're so smiley all of a sudden...

123
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,674
<i>Is that what this is?!</i>

124
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,885
<i>Arima has a thing for Aqua!</i>

125
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,488
<i>Akane!</i>

126
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:59,284
<i>Who am I supposed to root for?!</i>

127
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,457
Akane, your next job's decided.

128
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,627
Oh, is this true?

129
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,967
Aqua, we'll be able to
work together again.

130
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,765
You were the one behind
Pieyon's mask during our lessons, right?

131
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,726
Why did you do something like that?

132
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:34,111
Because you wouldn't talk to me.

133
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,115
That's it?

134
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,909
That's the only reason?

135
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:51,545
That's why you were running and dancing
with that hot mask on?

136
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,382
I did it once too,
but wasn't it tough as hell?

137
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,468
And you were talking in that creepy voice?

138
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,137
But hey, you're good at impressions!

139
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,682
You got yourself a surprising skill. Wow!

140
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:08,854
Like I said, if you wouldn't talk to me,
you would never listen to my directions.

141
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,149
It was just to make
my sister's first concert a success--

142
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,444
Sure, sure. This is one of your
sister complex moves again.

143
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,113
You have such a convenient excuse.

144
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,574
I'll leave it as that for you!

145
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,452
What's with you? I'm leaving.

146
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,913
You running? You running?

147
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,125
What are you talking about?
I'm not running from anything.

148
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,503
Just because I found out you did
something weird to talk to me,

149
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,089
you're gonna run
because you're embarrassed?

150
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,805
Fine, you seem to have the wrong idea,
so let's talk this out.

151
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,764
Sit down.

152
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,976
Bring it on!

153
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,480
I'm glad it seems like those two made up!

154
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,442
But it also seems like
things are just about to get worse.

155
00:12:55,442 --> 00:13:00,113
It's okay, Bro's not the type
who likes to get involved with others.

156
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,825
If you don't provoke him like that,
your relationship with him wouldn't last.

157
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,370
He wasn't like that before though.

158
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,330
Really?

159
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,418
Well, a lot happened
and he developed a twisted personality.

160
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,336
Oh.

161
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,633
When he's with <i>Senpai</i>,
he seems a bit like his old self though.

162
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,432
<i>Akane... you gotta work a little harder.</i>

163
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:36,358
Well! I've got us our first big title
in a long time!

164
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:40,862
Over a total of 50 million copies sold!
Its anime film was a megahit too!

165
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:45,825
The theatrical adaptation project of
the almighty popular manga, <i>Tokyo Blade</i>!

166
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,537
Oh, I know this!

167
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,998
My daughter's hooked on this
from the anime.

168
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,210
Theatrical means it's 2.5D, huh?

169
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,211
That's right!

170
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,924
I've got a huge budget for it,
so we're gonna make it flashy this time!

171
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,385
The stage is an interesting place too!

172
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,763
The seats rotate 360 degrees
and the stage uses computer graphics

173
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,140
to recreate
the original story's atmosphere!

174
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,352
I've secured a good crew too!

175
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:17,566
And for the adaptation, I've added on
Theater Lalalai's cooperation.

176
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,985
Oh, that's exciting.

177
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,446
I'm surprised you were able to
talk Mr. Kindaichi into doing it.

178
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:28,410
Money talks. Since any theater
has it tough financially.

179
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,288
All that's left is the casting.

180
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,249
We can probably get
Akane Kurokawa from Lalalai.

181
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,503
But pretty boys and cute girls will
be essential for our target audience.

182
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,630
Lalalai doesn't have many young actors,

183
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,967
so we'll need to bring some in
from the outside.

184
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,846
Kaburagi, you've got
strong connections there, don't you?

185
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,056
You know any good ones?

186
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,392
Well, I may know a few.

187
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,854
Some up-and-coming young ones.

188
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,357
I can introduce you,
but you'll owe me one.

189
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,151
No, no!

190
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,822
I'm giving the kids you're looking after
a chance to grow,

191
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,117
so actually, you'll owe <i>me</i> one!

192
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,210
Then it's a deal.

193
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,921
PROJECT PROPOSAL

194
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,718
Is this good?

195
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,511
I don't know, but I guess it's good.

196
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,391
Now, we've made our
boyfriend-girlfriend alibi for our fans.

197
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,435
So we'll be good for a while.

198
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,647
About that one job...
has the news reached you?

199
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,692
Is it about <i>Tokyo Blade</i>?

200
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,402
Yeah.

201
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:48,114
The theatrical troupe that I belong to
called Lalalai will be leading it,

202
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,367
so I've received an offer too.

203
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,911
<i>Theater Lalalai...</i>

204
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,164
I thought it might help her somehow,

205
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,334
so I introduced her
to this one theater's workshop.

206
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,585
A workshop?

207
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,796
It's called Theater Lalalai.

208
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,091
<i>The theater group that Akane belongs to.</i>

209
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,761
<i>It wasn't that famous at the time though.</i>

210
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,222
That's probably the place...

211
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,016
<i>where Ai fell in love.</i>

212
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:22,148
<i>Ever since Ai joined that workshop,
she started to care about her appearance.</i>

213
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,193
<i>And she would ask me
where the good restaurants were.</i>

214
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,155
<i>Of course I couldn't tell
who her dates were,</i>

215
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,659
<i>but I remember she suddenly
looked all grown-up.</i>

216
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,288
If you're curious, I'll introduce you
to Lalalai's superintendent.

217
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,167
You'll surely get closer to the answer
you're looking for there.

218
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:44,879
I'm doing it.

219
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,797
Right?

220
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:51,011
I got an offer to play Princess Saya,
and you'll be Touki, right?

221
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,555
<i>The two roles are a couple.</i>

222
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,224
<i>I bet whoever chose the cast
did this on purpose.</i>

223
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:01,563
I hear there's a high demand for BL
in 2.5D, but is this okay?

224
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,525
It's because the original story has
mainly male and female couplings.

225
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,945
Of course, many girls tend to have
that kind of view though.

226
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,865
Touki's a side character,

227
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,618
but he's pretty popular among men too
due to the rom-com elements.

228
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:21,166
Every week, everybody's discussing if
he'll get with the heroine or his partner.

229
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,377
Touki's partner, Tsurugi...

230
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,213
That role should also be filled soon.

231
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,798
I wonder who it'll be.

232
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,091
Me.

233
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,552
Arima.

234
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,430
Don't do live posts.

235
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,518
These types of posts can draw
troublesome fans into stalking you.

236
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,355
For any photos taken outside,
it's a basic rule to schedule posts.

237
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,275
Did you wanna cause trouble again
by making a weird fuss?

238
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,612
You need to learn, Akane Kurokawa.

239
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,824
Kana, you're playing Tsurugi?

240
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,411
How long has it been
since we were cast together?

241
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,623
I surely thought you quit acting.

242
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,917
Since you're an <i>idol</i> now, right?

243
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,876
Akane?

244
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,756
What's the point of locking yourself up
in a stage that doesn't make any money?

245
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,885
Oh! That's right, you were
on some reality dating show lately.

246
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:17,222
I heard you finally got popular
from selling off your private life.

247
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,681
Good for you!

248
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,599
Arima?

249
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:28,983
Well... I came to warn you guys
because I was just nearby.

250
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,694
Continue your business date
after you change location.

251
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,654
Bye.

252
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,664
You know Arima?

253
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:47,627
We're the same age and we've been
in the same industry since we were kids,

254
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,087
so of course.

255
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,590
Well, try to get along.

256
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,967
That's impossible.

257
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,513
She's always taken all of the jobs
that I wanted to do.

258
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,931
Try to imagine...

259
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:04,894
how it feels to be an actress born
the same year as that genius child star.

260
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,106
But I won't lose now.

261
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,443
While Kana was releasing that ridiculous
"Green Pepper Exercise,"

262
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,779
I was always doing my acting lessons.

263
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,492
This is my chance
to finally get my revenge.

264
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,161
I won't lose this time.

265
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,248
Why are all actors...

266
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:29,043
I won't lose to her.

267
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,087
<i>...so competitive?</i>

268
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,885
The child actress
formerly known as a genius

269
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,888
and the actress
currently known as a genius.

270
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,350
Kaburagi's clever but cruel
to put these two against each other.

271
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:51,316
Now, I'm personally looking forward
to <i>Tokyo Blade</i>'s stage!

272
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:32,732
<i>I think that you might
become an idol yourself one day, Ruby.</i>

273
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,861
<i>And maybe Aqua might be an actor?</i>

274
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,241
<i>I wonder what kind of adults
you two will become.</i>

275
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,293
<i>The culprit who put Ai to such a fate
is in the entertainment industry.</i>

276
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:56,965
<i>I'll find them no matter what it takes.</i>

277
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,095
<i>If it's for that, I'll...</i>

278
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:10,807
