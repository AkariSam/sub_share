1
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,886
And so...

2
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:37,932
the center at JIF will be Kana Arima!

3
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,142
Woot! Applause!

4
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,979
Give us a comment about how you feel
being chosen as the center!

5
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,356
Let's see.

6
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,609
First, turn that camera off.

7
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,821
I told you, right?

8
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,406
That I didn't want to be the center
numerous times.

9
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,117
Is this what I think it is?

10
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,911
You think an easy pushover like me

11
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:03,791
wouldn't be able to refuse later
if you guys made it a fact on camera?

12
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,376
<i>Crap, she knows!</i>

13
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,877
Uh, well!

14
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,964
Ruby and I talked about it
when we went to karaoke together.

15
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,843
But we came to the conclusion that
neither of us would make a good center.

16
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,097
And that's when we saw
the music video for your song...

17
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,185
So you guys saw it.

18
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:28,691
They mistakenly thought I could sing since
"Green Pepper Exercise" sold pretty well,

19
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,277
and everyone got burned for it.

20
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,614
Forget you saw it. That's a symbol
of the days when I was lost.

21
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,410
The dark ages
of when I lost my way in this field.

22
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,163
You don't need to say it like that.

23
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:46,125
Well, I almost peed my pants
seeing how little it sold.

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,752
Everyone who was affiliated
wants to put it behind them.

25
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,758
To be honest, I thought
"Green Pepper Exercise" was off-key.

26
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:59,138
But your second song was really good.

27
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,265
And your third song was even better.

28
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,101
You must've practiced a lot, huh?

29
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,813
You worked really hard trying to
live up to everyone's expectations.

30
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,942
Someone as responsible as you
should be the center of B Komachi...

31
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,818
Shut up!

32
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,697
You think I'll give in if you just keep
buttering me up, don't you?!

33
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,532
Do you think I'm stupid?!

34
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,952
I seriously can't do this.

35
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,955
No matter how many times you ask,
I won't become the center!

36
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,793
Sorry we acted without talking to you.

37
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,337
We won't ask anymore.

38
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,258
But at least listen to our singing.

39
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,604
Hey, isn't this pretty good?!

40
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,148
I knew Arima would be perfect
as the center!

41
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,108
At this rate, we'll do great at the JIF!

42
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:57,321
Ugh, jeez! Why am I always like this?!

43
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:03,452
Well, I never thought that we could turn
the tables from that hellish situation.

44
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,247
I had a feeling it would turn out this way
from the start.

45
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,040
Shut up, Quirky and Off-key!

46
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:13,254
I never thought that idol candidates
could be this terrible at singing.

47
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,713
Based on your singing,

48
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,841
I can see the comfortable lives you led
by relying on just your looks.

49
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,260
Brutal.

50
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,223
It's true that I should be
the one to do it.

51
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,935
<i>But I honestly don't want to do it.</i>

52
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,819
Seriously, what would you guys do
without me?!

53
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,197
Just make sure to work hard
to make me stand out!

54
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay!

55
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,826
Well, I'm glad it worked out!

56
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:48,914
<i>Why does my mouth always say
the opposite of what I'm thinking?</i>

57
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,584
Looks like it's settled then.

58
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,044
CEO!

59
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,256
There's barely any days left
until the concert.

60
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,217
And this is where
you really need to push yourselves.

61
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:04,013
I've grabbed someone to support you,
so make good use of him.

62
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,515
Someone to support us?

63
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,727
Is that perhaps Aqu--

64
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,187
- Hey.
- Wait, it's you?!

65
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,189
Oh, Pieyon, long time no see!

66
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,524
What? The real thing?!

67
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,443
You're our top seller!

68
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,611
I'm begging you, please work normally!

69
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,157
Well, Mr. Pieyon used to be
a pro dancer before!

70
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,577
He said in his videos that
he used to choreograph for idols too.

71
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,995
Really?

72
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,498
How do we look from a pro's point of view?

73
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,960
I think we're somewhat in shape now.

74
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:41,133
Hmm, well, there's a ton of girls
around your level who perform on stage.

75
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:45,137
But if you say you want real quality,

76
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,097
<i>first, you'll need stamina!</i>

77
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,058
<i>Ten more uphill dashes!</i>

78
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,309
<i>Eek!</i>

79
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:54,021
<i>And after you're exhausted,
three run-throughs of the set list!</i>

80
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,524
<i>It's important to first have the stamina
to keep your quality!</i>

81
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,360
<i>Don't forget to smile either!</i>

82
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,998
Before the second song's chorus,

83
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,585
if we come around from stage left
and swapped out, wouldn't that be cool?!

84
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,087
Oh, that sounds good!

85
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,047
Then what if we rearrange this too...

86
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,926
Where do they get all that energy from?

87
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,137
Do you regret it?

88
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,599
Becoming an idol.

89
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,643
Mr. Pieyon...

90
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:36,730
No, this is something I decided myself,
so I have no regrets.

91
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,775
But I do think that
I'm not cut out for this.

92
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,237
I don't feel like
I can become an idol at all.

93
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,531
Let alone the center.

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
You can sing, so why do you hate
being the center so much?

95
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,956
Well, because the center
is the group's face, right?

96
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,792
It's not a position
that someone like me should be in.

97
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,627
What do you mean "someone like me"?

98
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,713
I think Kana Arima is amazing.

99
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,592
Everyone always says
things like that so easily.

100
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,095
Even when they don't know anything.

101
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,765
What do <i>you</i> know about me?

102
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,725
Let's see...

103
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,979
You're a hard worker who runs
and does vocal exercises every morning.

104
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,897
Your foul mouth is your insecurity.

105
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,693
You're happier when the title
is acknowledged more than yourself.

106
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,236
You actually hate green peppers.

107
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,822
What? You know me really well!

108
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:27,906
I'm thrilled...

109
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,910
<i>Well, he's got me pretty good.</i>

110
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,497
<i>Crap. I think I like Pieyon a little now.</i>

111
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,625
Are you perhaps my fan?

112
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,668
That's right.

113
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,503
What? No way!

114
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,802
I didn't know I had any fans right now.

115
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,764
I've never officially stated
that I hated green peppers,

116
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,766
so I'm surprised you noticed.

117
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,768
In fact, I hate them too.

118
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,978
We're comrades!

119
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,606
That thing is too overpowering.

120
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,066
It makes the whole dish
taste like green peppers.

121
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,234
I know!

122
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,821
During my "Green Pepper Exercise,"
I had to force myself to eat them.

123
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,616
Now, I break out in hives
just looking at them.

124
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,201
Poor thing.

125
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,161
Do you hate chrysanthemum too?

126
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,206
Yeah, I can't!
It's as bitter as green peppers.

127
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,207
<i>Hey...</i>

128
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,834
<i>It's fun just talking casually with him.</i>

129
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,587
<i>This is quite rare.</i>

130
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,549
<i>I feel like
I can really fall for this person.</i>

131
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:32,262
<i>Maybe I should just forget Aqua
and move on to him.</i>

132
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,558
<i>He makes 100 million a year,
so honestly, I would date him.</i>

133
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,772
Pieyon's so nice to come here every day
when he must be busy.

134
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,108
Right? You know, he looks
completely different from his videos!

135
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,570
I thought he would be more built,

136
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,740
but the real thing
is surprisingly slender.

137
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,202
His physique is just like Aqua's!

138
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,706
If my brother spoke in that duck voice,
I wouldn't be able to stop laughing!

139
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,005
It's looking super good!

140
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,340
Yeah, it's really good now!

141
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,925
Good work.

142
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,761
Thank you so much, Mr. Pieyon!

143
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,475
Gosh, he's so nice!

144
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,061
Unlike someone called Aqua.

145
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,731
Arima, do you hate Aqua that much?

146
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,109
There isn't a single thing
you can like about him!

147
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,611
He's insensitive and lacks common sense!

148
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,863
He acts cool, but he's just withdrawn.

149
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,075
Him and his sister both don't know
how to treat their elders!

150
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,828
They've never used honorifics
toward me either!

151
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,455
I probably have to tell him off once!

152
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:47,045
<i>I'm much older than Arima,
but I don't remember her using honorifics.</i>

153
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:51,300
Aww, he was cute when he was a kid.

154
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,343
Oh, you two go way back?

155
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,138
That's right, we met on set
when we were little!

156
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,640
When Aqua and I were still three or four!

157
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,768
You know, you can't forget a guy like that
once you meet him!

158
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,771
Ever since, he's always been
in the back of my mind!

159
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,318
I thought he was like an angel back then,
but look how evil he's grown up to be!

160
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,987
I wish he wouldn't ruin my memories!

161
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,113
Umm?

162
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,366
Break's over! Let's practice!

163
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,332
Tomorrow's finally the day.

164
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,626
How do you think they're doing?

165
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,170
<i>I think they've gotten much better.</i>

166
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,632
<i>Ruby's dancing was already polished
from the start.</i>

167
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,385
<i>Mem-cho can carefully move about
as she watches her surroundings.</i>

168
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,513
<i>And Ms. Arima is earnest
and she learns quick.</i>

169
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,142
<i>Even while she's singing, there aren't
any obvious mistakes in her dancing.</i>

170
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,060
MR. PIEYON

171
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,230
<i>This afternoon, have them practice with
markers in mind, then rest for tomorrow.</i>

172
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,148
Okay.

173
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:53,487
<i>Thank you for accepting a painstaking
request like this during your vacation.</i>

174
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:57,407
Well, I like those girls too.

175
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,826
So I'm glad you asked me for help.

176
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,038
But I'm a little shocked.

177
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,626
<i>Since no one's noticed that
you're impersonating me.</i>

178
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,711
<i>It's impressive.</i>

179
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,507
<i>Can anyone who acts do this that easily?</i>

180
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,135
I don't know. I'm sure people
who are good at it can do it.

181
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,220
<i>Hm.</i>

182
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,932
<i>But was this necessary?</i>

183
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,142
<i>You didn't have to bother
impersonating me...</i>

184
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,187
She probably would've refused
to listen to anything I said.

185
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:32,025
That's why I thought she would listen
to your words, Mr. Pieyon.

186
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,863
<i>But I think she would've listened
even if they were your words.</i>

187
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,577
I'm... actually a pretty weak person.

188
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,168
It's finally here!
We're gonna make our debut as idols!

189
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,628
What do we do?!

190
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,630
Shut up.

191
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,173
Just go to sleep.

192
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,676
Don't underestimate
the importance of sleep.

193
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,346
"Some university's research says
the damage from an all-nighter

194
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,934
will drag on for three days
and decrease your charm by 30%."

195
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,812
That's what D**Go said.

196
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,730
D**Go did?! I gotta sleep then!

197
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,899
But I'm not sleepy at all!

198
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,862
I'm too excited! What should I do?!

199
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,283
Seriously, it must be nice
to be able to have so much fun.

200
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:24,703
It must be horrible when you seem like
you never have any fun.

201
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,790
Rather, why are you always so excited?

202
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,836
Nobody can predict
what'll happen tomorrow.

203
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,756
A group using connections like us
might get booed like crazy.

204
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,595
Or maybe there won't be enough customers
and the venue could be empty.

205
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,723
How can you stay so positive like that?

206
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,516
Hmm.

207
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,145
Because it's my dream.

208
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,693
<i>A long time ago, I was living a life
where I had to stay indoors all the time.</i>

209
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,238
<i>I had no hope for the future.</i>

210
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,576
<i>I thought I would quietly die like that</i>

211
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,662
<i>without knowing any excitement or fun.</i>

212
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,539
<i>But...</i>

213
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>My life became so fun
after I became an idol otaku.</i>

214
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,133
<i>My heart was filled with love.</i>

215
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,596
The life of a fan is nice.

216
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:29,309
If you've never liked an idol,
<i>Senpai</i>, you're missing out in life.

217
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,561
I don't mind missing out.

218
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,231
And so, that's when I met this one person.

219
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,857
One person?

220
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,817
Yeah, my first love.

221
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,486
Oh, how bittersweet.

222
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,613
<i>That person told me.</i>

223
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>That he'll become my fan
if I ever became an idol.</i>

224
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,914
<i>From that moment,
I always dreamt of becoming an idol.</i>

225
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,543
I wonder where Doctor is right now.

226
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,379
I'm sure he's still an idol otaku.

227
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,508
So if I can become popular as an idol...

228
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,177
someday...

229
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,023
That's nice,
you have a fan to support you.

230
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,902
I don't have anyone like that.

231
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,905
<i>Everyone sees the child star in me.</i>

232
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,325
<i>But there's no one who sees me
for who I am now.</i>

233
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,958
<i>But it was surprising to know
that Ruby was a shut-in.</i>

234
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,460
<i>Aqua and the CEO went through
a lot of trouble too.</i>

235
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,589
<i>Pieyon's mask!</i>

236
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,925
<i>He never takes it off,
so I was getting curious</i>

237
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,637
<i>what kind of face is behind that mask!</i>

238
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,736
Now, here we are at...

239
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,738
Japan Idol Festival!

240
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,740
Umm.

241
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,244
Of the 10 stages, the one we'll be
performing on is the Star Stage.

242
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,830
This stage has a lot of underground idols.

243
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,083
I would've preferred the main stage.

244
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,544
But you know that's asking for too much.

245
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:23,423
Ugh, I'm getting nervous now!
I wonder if I'll be able to do okay.

246
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,884
Don't worry! You got enough sleep, right?!

247
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,304
"'Some university's research says
the damage from an all-nighter

248
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:33,141
will drag on for three days
and decrease your charm by 30%.'

249
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,102
That's what Dai** said!"
is what <i>Senpai</i> said!

250
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,230
You're quoting someone who's quoting
someone who's quoting someone.

251
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,651
Well, most of B Komachi's
choreography is hard,

252
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,569
so it'll be tough
if we don't sleep properly.

253
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,573
Our main feature is the dancing,
so we really gotta sleep well!

254
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,786
<i>What should I do?
In the end, I couldn't sleep a wink.</i>

255
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,455
Now, off to the dressing room.

256
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,957
Yay!

257
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,168
- I wonder what the dressing room is like.
<i>- Aqua's under Pieyon's mask?</i>

258
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,338
<i>But he's not that buff.</i>

259
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,632
<i>They swapped out? Why?</i>

260
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,718
<i>Is it so I would take
the lessons seriously?</i>

261
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,971
<i>Was him being nice to me all a lie?</i>

262
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,933
<i>My head's a mess.
When this is such an important day...</i>

263
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,435
<i>Jeez, this is the worst.</i>

264
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,314
<i>Let's hurry to the dressing room.
Then I can sleep a little.</i>

265
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,691
It's not that way!

266
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,650
What?

267
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,487
The stage dressing room can only
be used right before your turn.

268
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,947
Really?

269
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,865
Then where do we change?

270
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,580
Hey, move your stuff over!

271
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,541
Ugh, does anyone have a pantyliner?!

272
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,463
What is this hellhole?

273
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,464
The dressing room.

274
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,301
The number of people here is insane.

275
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,929
This is pretty normal
for festivals with many stages.

276
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,058
Hundreds of performers
and staff are all squeezed in together

277
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,643
with no place for your luggage.

278
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:02,856
There isn't even a real dressing room,
so you change behind the room dividers.

279
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,317
<i>But the photo spot alone
looks really nice.</i>

280
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,944
<i>This is chaos.</i>

281
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:13,908
<i>Of course, the famous groups invited
to the main stage get separate rooms.</i>

282
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:18,455
But underground or so-so idols are
all treated like this.

283
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,459
If you want to be treated better,
you have to become popular.

284
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:28,757
Now, it'll get busy before your turn,
so eat or get prepared while you can.

285
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,175
Okay!

286
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,016
All this heated excitement...

287
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,518
Are you okay?

288
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,146
Well, I'm just a little sleep-deprived.

289
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,898
Oh, are you nervous?

290
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,691
Please, don't be silly.

291
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:51,237
I've been in this industry
since I was sucking on a bottle.

292
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,823
There's no way I would get nervous now.

293
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,077
Just leave the two to me.

294
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,286
Really.

295
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,788
Can I have a minute?

296
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,247
Oh, yes.

297
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:09,047
<i>That's right,
I have to take care of this group.</i>

298
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:13,802
<i>With my 17 years of showbiz experience,
I have to lead those two hatchlings.</i>

299
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,054
<i>Don't be overwhelmed by the atmosphere.</i>

300
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,306
<i>Don't be scared. Get it together!</i>

301
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,519
<i>There's a ton of people's jobs
on my shoulders.</i>

302
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,814
<i>If I screw up, everyone's screwed.</i>

303
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,734
<i>And I would betray the trust
and expectations they have of me.</i>

304
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,238
<i>I just remembered something bad.</i>

305
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,864
<i>I can't think negatively.</i>

306
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,747
<i>The look of disappointment that says,
"I guess this is it."</i>

307
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,543
<i>The staff joins the crowd
in their own clothes</i>

308
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,503
<i>just so the seats look more filled.</i>

309
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:54,342
<i>When artists can't meet expectations,
it's hard to describe that pain we feel.</i>

310
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:01,474
Well, let's stop here once, and we'll
release the next one when the time comes.

311
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,770
Um, is there any work I can do?

312
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,855
I'll do any--

313
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,650
Uh, well, we're a child acting agency,

314
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,653
so work at your age is a little tough.

315
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,574
I'm sure there's jobs for you
at a normal agency though.

316
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,660
Grandpa injured his back,

317
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,288
so Mama's thinking of going back home.

318
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,748
Kana, you'll be fine by yourself, right?

319
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,917
Of course I'll be fine!

320
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,420
Mama, you get rested up too!

321
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,006
<i>Am I not needed anymore?</i>

322
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,216
KANA ARIMA STARS IN
I'LL GO WITH SWEET TODAY

323
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,551
IS THERE ANY VALUE TO HER NOW?

324
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,927
THE GROWN-UP ARIMA HAS NO FANS.

325
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,264
There's no value in me
who isn't a child actress anymore!

326
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,392
The grown-up Kana Arima has no fans!

327
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,519
<i>Since when...</i>

328
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,940
<i>When did I start self-deprecating with
words that sound like internet comments?</i>

329
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,987
<i>Lead the B Komachi?</i>

330
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,907
<i>How arrogant of me to even consider it.</i>

331
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,618
<i>But I have to do it.</i>

332
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,870
<i>I have to take care of those two.</i>

333
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,080
Umm.

334
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,624
Oh, <i>Senpai</i>!

335
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:12,629
Oh my gosh!

336
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,464
I'm getting super nervous!

337
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,590
What?!

338
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,676
You seemed like you were
enjoying yourself just a second ago.

339
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,221
As our turn got closer, I gradually...

340
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,680
What should I do?

341
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,016
<i>Senpai</i>, aren't you scared?

342
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,392
Of course not.

343
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,770
How many years
do you think I've been doing this?

344
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,523
Everyone always lies like that.

345
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,320
Your hands are super cold.

346
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,948
<i>Senpai</i>, you're nervous too, aren't you?

347
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,784
Don't be stupid!

348
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:46,162
I never sank so low as to
where I need you to worry about me!

349
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,457
The small insecure dogs tend to bark more.

350
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,417
But I'm glad.

351
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,088
I feel relieved to know
that you're scared too.

352
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,093
Huh? Are you pretty seriously scared?

353
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:01,886
You'll be fine!

354
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,138
We're not doing this alone!

355
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,390
That's why!

356
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,308
That's why it isn't good!

357
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,643
It's because of you guys!

358
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,939
If I was going up on stage alone,
I would think nothing of it.

359
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,401
I've failed like that repeatedly
up to this point.

360
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,654
But this time, you two are here.

361
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,031
<i>I don't want you to fail.</i>

362
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,160
I don't want you two
to go through what I experienced.

363
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,164
I'm not alone, that's why I'm scared.

364
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:43,303
I don't know much about
your child actress days.

365
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,723
And I don't know how much you value
your showbiz experience,

366
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:51,227
but to me, you're just a young girl.

367
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:56,065
You're just a cute and hardworking
rookie idol found anywhere.

368
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,152
Screwing up is normal!

369
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,903
Let's enjoy the challenge!

370
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,496
Come on, it's our turn to change!
Let's go, <i>Senpai</i>!

371
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,046
Oh my gosh!

372
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,839
I'm super nervous!

373
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,550
But I'm so excited!

374
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,937
<i>I am a rookie.</i>

375
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,524
<i>The rookie idol, Kana Arima.</i>

376
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:15,872
