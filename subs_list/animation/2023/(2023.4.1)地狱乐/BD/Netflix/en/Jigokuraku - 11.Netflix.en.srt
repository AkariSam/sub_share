1
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,518
Brother!

2
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,021
He had talent,
but he was just human after all.

3
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,731
He breaks easily.

4
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,900
Move! Dammit!

5
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,235
-Return him to the pit.
-Move!

6
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,611
-While he's alive.
-Brother!

7
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,154
-That is what we must do.
-Brother!

8
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,990
Because I have intelligence.

9
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,033
Brother!

10
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,832
You shouldn't let
your guard down, monster.

11
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,416
Toma!

12
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,419
What are you doing over here?

13
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,588
Didn't I tell you to take
care of the small fry?

14
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,092
Yes… I'm sorry, Brother.

15
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,011
<i>His throat is regenerating. Why is that?</i>

16
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,849
<i>He should be an ordinary human… No.</i>

17
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,727
<i>Could they have mixed with him in the pit?</i>

18
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,982
Monster. I got
a weird feeling from you earlier.

19
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,233
What was that?

20
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,696
<i>Is he talking about Tao? An ordinary</i>
<i>human shouldn't be able to sense it…</i>

21
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,824
Come on! Are you out of
dumb things to say?

22
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,953
Or is whatever that was
the true form of the monsters' powers?

23
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,666
Is it the key to destroying Lord Tensen?

24
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:51,087
<i>His Tao is much bigger than it was before…</i>

25
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,174
<i>I can feel it. This man is dangerous.</i>

26
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,718
<i>I must kill him now.</i>

27
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,346
I can't see it.

28
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,851
<i>So much strength for this body…</i>

29
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,312
<i>That thing I felt must be the secret!</i>

30
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:19,324
<i>His Tao is increasing even more…</i>
<i>Is it because of the vines?</i>

31
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,576
<i>He's gone beyond the limits of humanity.</i>

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,078
<i>My brother is a genius at adapting.</i>

33
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:28,791
<i>But at this rate… I don't think…</i>
<i>he can handle much more…</i>

34
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,045
I don't really know how…

35
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,839
But my body has become amazingly useful.

36
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,468
What courage you have. Are you not afraid
of your body changing…

37
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,595
that you may not be human anymore?

38
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,600
Nope. Nothing in this world is unchanging.

39
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,601
<i>I know that better than anyone.</i>

40
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,355
One thing that never changes
is more than enough.

41
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,107
One thing? You mean yourself?

42
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,401
No…

43
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,112
<i>-What are you doing?</i>
<i>-Brother!</i>

44
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,449
Your upbringing shows on your faces.

45
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,869
You look too classy. People are
underestimating us as your crew.

46
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,331
I'll have to make you fit the part.

47
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,792
Starting with the younger brother.

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,004
Huh?

49
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,009
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?

50
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,346
Do I look classy now?

51
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,516
If you still have complaints,
make me look better.

52
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,519
A monster wouldn't understand.

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
No one understands.

54
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,485
Now, show me more of that power!

55
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,244
You… I knew it!

56
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,830
The navel is your weakness!

57
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:55,044
<i>It's getting bigger and bigger…</i>
<i>What is this man?</i>

58
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,593
I saw it…

59
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,638
I thought you were
throwing weird stuff at me…

60
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,349
But it's all over your body too.

61
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,852
-Soshin! To me--
-Oh…

62
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,478
That's not possible.

63
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,857
Since I killed them all.

64
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:22,113
Come on! Show me more of that power!

65
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,365
Reveal your hand!

66
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,955
I see… So that's how you gather it.

67
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,752
But even though it's all around you,
it doesn't increase your defense?

68
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,337
-I took you down easily.
<i>-This ridiculous…</i>

69
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,592
<i>When I fought that other guy,</i>
<i>my attacks were pretty much useless.</i>

70
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,886
Is it because I didn't have any around me?

71
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,887
<i>Impossible…</i>

72
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,097
I feel like there's a lot more to it.

73
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,100
Well, I guess I just have to try.

74
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,561
Is this Tao?

75
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,520
<i>Impossible!</i>

76
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,030
Look at that!
Seems like you can be killed.

77
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,284
<i>I can see all the Tao of your dying body!</i>

78
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,914
Get up, monster!

79
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,125
I have so many questions
I want to ask you.

80
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,170
First, where is Lord Tensen?

81
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,133
<i>Somehow it looks like he's got more scars…</i>

82
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:26,928
What's up?

83
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,681
Hey, what are you spacing out for?

84
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,225
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,185
Help me tie him up.

86
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,812
<i>Am I seeing things?</i>

87
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,731
<i>For now I'm glad that</i>
<i>he's still alive, but…</i>

88
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,192
<i>Is he really okay?</i>

89
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,195
<i>And those scars…</i>
<i>They look like lacerations.</i>

90
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,155
<i>Or like a plant…</i>

91
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,658
<i>Like the vines of a plant…</i>

92
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,831
What do you think, Little Lady?
Is my swordsmanship cool or what?

93
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,957
Strong…

94
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,293
That Tao thing will come
easily for me, don't you think?

95
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,798
Tao… Strong, weak.

96
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,300
Strong, strong bad.

97
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,803
I don't get it.

98
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,223
-How about this?
-Strong, strong bad!

99
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,226
-Or this?
-Strong, strong!

100
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,146
Tao… Strong, weak.

101
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,815
This conversation is impossible.

102
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,192
Are you telling me brute force is bad?

103
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,739
He's pretty good for being so small.

104
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,032
What about him, Little Lady?

105
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,244
Strong, strong. Bad, bad.

106
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,871
The Hollow and The Blade Dragon…

107
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,582
They're both so reliable!

108
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,875
What are you doing?

109
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,377
I'm analyzing the monsters.

110
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,714
Each one is different,
with a different internal structure.

111
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,048
Even though they're similar,

112
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,759
this one's internal
structure is like a fish's

113
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,511
and this one's like a human.

114
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,804
So?

115
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,432
Everyone's weak point is different.

116
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,268
It's pretty mysterious
from a biological standpoint…

117
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,648
And she's the same way. What even is she?

118
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,071
<i>She used some kind of power</i>
<i>to shave down the cliff and escape.</i>

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,406
<i>That's what it looked like.</i>

120
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,659
<i>A normal human</i>
<i>wouldn't be able to do that.</i>

121
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,745
<i>A normal human…</i>

122
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,669
<i>I made her cry again…</i>
<i>So she's still a child inside.</i>

123
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,087
Hey, ninja!

124
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,673
Don't make the Little Lady cry!

125
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,218
You won't win the ladies
with a look like that!

126
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,679
I don't want any ladies.
I'm a married man.

127
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,597
What?

128
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,266
That's not what I mean!

129
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,353
If you want to be my sidekick,
you can't make ladies cry!

130
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,772
I'm not your sidekick.

131
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,359
<i>He's more human than</i>
<i>the rumors say, this "Hollow"…</i>

132
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,029
Strong, strong, strong! Bad!

133
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,657
Do you have a wife?

134
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,908
I have…

135
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,160
a woman in every corner of the country!

136
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,801
I have been secretly
looking for you, Lady Mei.

137
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,803
"Lady" Mei…?

138
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,390
It has been several hundred years
since you were expelled from the castle.

139
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,725
You have not been seen in Horai.

140
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,311
We were at a loss as to where to find you.

141
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,064
Lord Rien ordered us not to look for you…

142
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,984
It is good fortune that I meet you here.

143
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,945
I am filled with emotion.

144
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,364
Now, let us return together.

145
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,201
We need your assistance.

146
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,786
What is going on?

147
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,582
That is what I would like to know.
I do not know how it got this way,

148
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,461
but she is not a being that should
be consorting with humans like you.

149
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,630
She is the same rank as Lord Tensen.

150
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,717
Humans are merely
nutrition for the likes of her.

151
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,927
Tensen? The one we talked about?

152
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,345
Is she the same?

153
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,848
<i>So she isn't human…</i>

154
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,603
Please return to Horai
and show us the way.

155
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,731
Without your help, we are…

156
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>If I keep getting</i>
<i>bogged down with all this trouble</i>

157
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,235
<i>I'll lose sight of the goal.</i>

158
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,573
<i>I need to figure out what</i>
<i>she wants, why she helped me…</i>

159
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,451
<i>And what I need to do now.</i>

160
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,127
What are you doing, human?

161
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,879
Well… I don't know.

162
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,549
If your intention is to
help her, it is misplaced.

163
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,676
This is our problem.

164
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,346
Well, yeah, that's true.

165
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,766
I don't know what's going
on, so this might be rash.

166
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,353
This isn't really my style anyway,
and it's kind of a pain.

167
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,773
I didn't expect myself to be so impulsive.

168
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,149
But…

169
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,902
I don't want her to cry again.

170
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,279
Let's leave it at that.

171
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,366
What a terrible inconvenience.

172
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,661
In any case, we came here
to turn you into Tan.

173
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,163
Where did…?

174
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,627
We will bring Lady Mei home.

175
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,880
Is that one the leader of the butterflies?

176
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,466
I'll kill him.

177
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,267
<i>Based on their appearance,</i>
<i>these guys must be bug handlers.</i>

178
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,395
<i>Or… possibly their leaders?</i>

179
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,397
<i>I better not get too close.</i>

180
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,027
I lost my left hand because of these guys.

181
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,405
I better show them my thanks.

182
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,074
Where is my thanks?

183
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,369
I was the one who
reconstruc-- healed your hand.

184
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,663
I'm pretty sure it's a figure of speech.

185
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,915
No, I'm serious.

186
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,419
Losing my hand has sharpened
my abilities even further.

187
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,297
My sword is even stronger than before!

188
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,177
-What?
<i>-The invisible attack I saw before?</i>

189
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,179
<i>They can use it too…</i>

190
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,599
Don't just charge in. They have
some sort of invisible power.

191
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,935
I see. That must be Tao.

192
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,524
These bugs are incessant!

193
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,989
Stay out of my way, sidekick!

194
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,575
I'm not your sidekick,
and you're the one in the way.

195
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,369
I'm trying to kill that butterfly!

196
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,414
You are not our opponents.

197
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,375
You should have no connection to Lady Mei.

198
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,544
Why do you try to protect her?

199
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:34,879
<i>True…</i>

200
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,132
<i>The old me might have</i>
<i>left her by the wayside.</i>

201
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:42,344
<i>Since stepping foot on this island,</i>
<i>I've done many things that were unlike me.</i>

202
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,264
<i>But… I don't think it's bad.</i>

203
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,559
When you owe someone
a favor, you help them.

204
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,269
That's obvious.

205
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:54,231
I'd ask the same of you.
Why are you so fixated on her?

206
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,775
It looks like she doesn't like you.

207
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,946
We are beings who study and practice Tao.

208
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,700
Lady Mei is an important,
indispensable figure in our training.

209
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,953
A monster like you actually training?

210
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,498
Tao is inherent in all things.

211
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,000
Foolish, pitiful humans,

212
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,211
I will teach you before you become Tan.

213
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,297
<i>There are five trainings</i>
<i>that increase your Tao.</i>

214
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,510
<i>Doin, Taisoku, Shuitsu, Shuten,</i>

215
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,639
and the most important, Bochu Jutsu.

216
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,725
Bochu Jutsu requires a partner,

217
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,978
as it circulates Yin and Yang
through a physical union.

218
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,606
What does "physical union" mean?

219
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,068
Put simply, it's sexual intercourse.

220
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:39,985
What?!

221
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,781
So doing it is a type
of training? Ridiculous.

222
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,616
It is a sublime training.

223
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,371
<i>All things in nature possess</i>
<i>the energy of either Yin or Yang.</i>

224
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,707
<i>When these polar opposites are</i>
<i>looped in a cycle, Tao increases.</i>

225
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,711
<i>Doin, Taisoku, and the other practices</i>
<i>prepare the mind and body,</i>

226
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,756
<i>and then Yin and Yang join</i>
<i>and become a cycle.</i>

227
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,259
<i>That is Bochu Jutsu.</i>

228
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,886
<i>The heightened Tao that results</i>

229
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,598
<i>gives one the ability to change</i>
<i>the natural way of the world.</i>

230
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,852
<i>The one who has achieved</i>
<i>the pinnacle of this practice</i>

231
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,145
<i>is our master, Lord Tensen.</i>

232
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,899
<i>Lord Tensen is transcendent existence.</i>
<i>They have not only</i>

233
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,653
<i>mastered Bochu Jutsu, but have both Yin</i>
<i>and Yang circulating within themselves.</i>

234
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,656
<i>With the repeated</i>
<i>circulation of Yin and Yang,</i>

235
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,533
<i>they can transform and raise their Tao.</i>

236
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,661
<i>In order to reach</i>
<i>the highest level of Tao,</i>

237
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,789
<i>they have devoted themselves</i>
<i>to training for a thousand years.</i>

238
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,959
Their Yin and Yang manifests as gender.

239
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,670
Lord Tensen possesses
both extremes in one person.

240
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,172
<i>The circulation of</i>
<i>polar opposite Yin and Yang…</i>

241
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,174
<i>Changing between a man and a woman…</i>

242
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,138
However, ordinary beings possess only one.

243
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,808
Therefore, in order to circulate both
Yin and Yang, they need a partner.

244
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,227
We are male-- Yang energy.

245
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,023
Lady Mei is Yin,
and she possesses special Yin energy.

246
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:03,652
The joining and circulation
of our Yang and her Yin

247
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,988
is Bochu Jutsu training.

248
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,781
Are you saying…?

249
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,284
Don't say it out loud. It's revolting.

250
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,954
Lady Mei descends from
the same lineage as Lord Tensen,

251
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,415
but is inferior as she possesses only Yin.

252
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,126
<i>Therefore, she was</i>
<i>banished from the castle.</i>

253
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,047
<i>Lord Rien granted Lady Mei two options.</i>

254
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,549
<i>Die like a dog by the roadside,</i>

255
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,261
or remain in Horai
as our training partner.

256
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,389
Lady Mei's scars are
from the hand of Lord Rien.

257
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,600
They brand her for her role.

258
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,689
However, Lady Mei disappeared from Horai.

259
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,984
Please return,
for the sake of our training.

260
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,154
Now I understand why
the Little Lady was so afraid.

261
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,239
You guys are creepy and gross.

262
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,493
As if a human could understand.

263
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,496
Hey ninja, I've got the centipede if--

264
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,584
<i>I haven't been myself since I arrived.</i>

265
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,628
<i>No…</i>

266
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,297
<i>I was just about to see</i>
<i>a version of myself I never knew.</i>

267
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,049
<i>I'm a little surprised.</i>

268
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,761
<i>It looks like I can't allow that.</i>

269
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,808
A brand…

270
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,644
Stop talking about her
like she's an object.

271
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,145
So that's how it will be.

272
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,649
It seems turning you
into Tan will be difficult.

273
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,655
Senjutsu: False-Kishikai.

274
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,657
You will all die here!

275
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,158
You can try!

276
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,869
Seems like Sennin can
transform into <i>yokai</i> monsters.

277
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,914
<i>Lord Tensen also</i>
<i>transformed into a monster…</i>

278
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,291
<i>Is this the same art?</i>

279
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,170
<i>I can't lose this fight.</i>

280
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,928
Your lumpy parts are easier to dodge!

281
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>I'm dizzy…</i>

282
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,474
<i>Did I breathe in some bug dust?</i>

283
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,560
<i>Fighting them is a serious challenge.</i>

284
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,812
-Sidekick! I need your assistance!
-I can't!

285
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,190
<i>It's hard… but…</i>

286
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,191
<i>It can burn.</i>

287
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,823
Senjutsu: Tin Splinter!

288
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,077
<i>Its attacks aren't</i>
<i>as powerful as Lord Tensen's,</i>

289
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,287
<i>but I can't see them.</i>

290
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,915
Those butterflies
are dangerous, Chibimaru.

291
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,626
<i>Ninja Art: Fire Bridge!</i>

292
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,133
Stop.

293
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,635
We could harm Lady Mei
with such poor visibility.

294
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,305
<i>Invisible power… Tao…</i>

295
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,724
<i>I can feel it faintly.</i>

296
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,226
<i>If I can't get</i>
<i>a good sense of it, I can't win.</i>

297
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,188
<i>And I can't afford to</i>
<i>lose against this opponent.</i>

298
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,565
<i>The real fight is yet to come.</i>

299
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,692
<i>If I could just understand what she said…</i>

300
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,403
You're focusing too much
on strength, I think.

301
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,572
To see Tao,

302
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,742
strength and weakness
must coexist in your mind.

303
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,952
How do you know?

304
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,163
Just as Sugita Genpaku and his colleagues

305
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,416
translated Ontleedkundige
Tafelen on their own,

306
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,711
I deciphered what she was
saying and had her demonstrate.

307
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,006
I had her access my Tao directly.

308
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,592
It helped me sense it for myself.

309
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,011
<i>I can feel something,</i>

310
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,222
<i>but that's it. I don't see anything.</i>

311
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,479
In order to see Tao, you have to train,

312
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,607
and put your mind
in a very specific state.

313
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,025
You, Gabimaru,

314
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,986
have to weaken your mind.

315
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,406
Weaken it? But we're
in the middle of a battle.

316
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,366
Even so.

317
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,494
Tao is like a visualization of life force.

318
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,248
Without both strength
and weakness, you won't sense it.

319
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,376
<i>Weaken my mind?</i>

320
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,586
Strength is the fruit of weakness.

321
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,673
Weakness is the seed of strength.

322
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,261
That is not weakness.
That is the seed of strength.

323
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:01,765
Strength, weakness… It's all… important.

324
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,604
Well, it's not something
you can master in a day.

325
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,772
No.

326
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,400
That's enough. I've got the gist.

327
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,318
What? What do you mean? Hey--

328
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,028
Hey, wait!

329
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,613
-Big.
-Huh?

330
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,868
Gabimaru's… Tao is… big.

331
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,163
<i>That sensation.</i>

332
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,668
Senjutsu: Tin Splinter!

333
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,589
He's dodging…
He understood it just from that?

334
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,049
He's an Iwagakure Ninja.

335
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,344
<i>I've heard some members</i>
<i>have otherworldly powers.</i>

336
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>He may not have heard the word Tao before…</i>

337
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,725
<i>but I wouldn't be surprised</i>
<i>if he knew something similar.</i>

338
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,270
This is the true nature
of Gabimaru the Hollow.

339
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,356
The result of training that
makes you discard your humanity.

340
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,494
<i>Based on the Tao's movement, I can read</i>
<i>each attack's intent and course.</i>

341
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,997
<i>I can also clearly sense what's behind me.</i>

342
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,418
<i>This is the same sensation</i>
<i>as when I couldn't attain</i>

343
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,379
<i>any of the techniques</i>
<i>drilled into me at Iwagakure.</i>

344
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,632
<i>It's not just the strong auras…</i>

345
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,676
<i>I can feel the weak auras too.</i>
<i>I can feel everything around me!</i>

346
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,554
<i>By accepting my own weakness…</i>

347
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,849
<i>I could sense the weaknesses</i>
<i>of those around me…</i>

348
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,808
<i>Right?</i>

349
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,103
<i>In between my stubborn heart</i>
<i>and my delicate heart…</i>

350
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,105
<i>Or their coexistence.</i>

351
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,150
<i>It's like I'm in wave of conflict.</i>

352
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,654
<i>I understand now.</i>

353
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,282
<i>Her strength can go on without hesitation.</i>

354
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,787
<i>Even stronger… Even weaker…</i>

355
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,665
<i>The Tao of each and every bug on his arm…</i>

356
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,917
<i>I can tell the intent and course.</i>

357
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,962
<i>Like I know how a single drop of water</i>

358
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,298
<i>can hit its surroundings</i>
<i>and create a huge ripple.</i>

359
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,428
<i>Ninja arts?</i>

360
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:09,101
<i>No… This feat is impossible</i>
<i>for humans. It's like…</i>

361
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,061
<i>Like… A Tensen!</i>

362
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,314
You can't beat me now.

363
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,909
Now I'm finally
in the same ring as Lord Tensen.

364
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,705
<i>That he was able to perceive</i>
<i>Tao in such a short time…</i>

365
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,665
<i>The accuracy of his attack…</i>

366
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,833
Speak.

367
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,420
Where are the others?
Where is Lord Tensen?

368
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,715
It is the end for me. I shall answer.

369
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,092
Including me, there are three Doshi

370
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,429
who were ordered to scout out
the humans by Lord Tensen.

371
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,682
<i>They believed that there was something</i>
<i>different about the newest arrivals.</i>

372
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,684
<i>If left alone,</i>

373
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,061
<i>their fangs could've come for our throats.</i>

374
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,314
It seems that was correct.

375
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,066
Wait!

376
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,736
The sidekick cannot outshine the star!

377
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,279
I will deal the finishing blow!

378
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,196
I'm not a sidekick!

379
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,330
Ninja Art: Thunder Stones

380
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,331
Centipede Version!

381
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:26,970
Is this…

382
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,473
Horai?

383
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,474
WELCOME

384
