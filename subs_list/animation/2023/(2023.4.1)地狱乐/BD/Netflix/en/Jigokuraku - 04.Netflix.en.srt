1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,169
<i>I was known as the Blade Dragon,</i>

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,922
<i>and Eight Provinces Unparalleled.</i>

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>When there was no man stronger than me,</i>

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>the clan leader, Tatsumi</i>
<i>requested that I be an officer.</i>

5
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,561
<i>He was a pompous man</i>
<i>who was proud of his large house,</i>

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,982
<i>But for the sake of food and for the sake</i>
<i>of the dragon, I readily agreed to do it.</i>

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,570
Wow, what a good drinker you are.

8
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,613
Good for you!

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,035
But, Sir Tamiya Gantetsusai…

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,204
Even though you're called
the Blade Dragon,

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,499
you cannot slay a real dragon.

12
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>So that's why I slashed</i>

13
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,590
<i>the dragon at the gate,</i>

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,509
<i>and the guts of the cowardly dragon.</i>

15
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,639
You're too reckless.
I can't understand you.

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,100
I think so too.

17
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,063
As a result, I was kicked out of
the clan and condemned to death.

18
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,023
I don't regret it though.

19
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,610
If only I could get the letter of
official release, I would be pardoned.

20
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,612
Then I could improve
my swordsmanship even more.

21
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,615
I'd cut the house in half this time.

22
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,826
I cannot understand you after all.

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,163
If you ask me, I don't understand you.

24
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,958
Those swords you're carrying are
for dissecting, right?

25
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,169
What a gloomy fellow you are.

26
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,465
Do you feel good killing sinners,
whatever your name is?

27
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,051
My name is Asaemon.

28
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,928
Yamada Asaemon Fuchi.

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,929
THE 9TH RANK ASAEMON,
YAMADA ASAEMON FUCHI

30
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,973
The Yamada Clan's business is
not limited to beheading,

31
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,226
but also includes testing swords
and pharmaceuticals.

32
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,394
We're contributing to society.

33
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,938
Even more than you.

34
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>So are autopsies…</i>

35
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,067
<i>the elucidation of the human anatomy</i>

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,153
<i>is a noble mission to advance medicine.</i>

37
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,703
I will not forgive you if you insult me.

38
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,709
Well, I don't mind.

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,087
-Just don't get in my way, okay?
-Hey wait!

40
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,466
Do you have any ideas?

41
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,052
Of course I do.

42
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,721
We're going to destroy our competitors.

43
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,476
It's more efficient
to search for the elixir later.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,979
And most of all,
I can wield my sword to the fullest!

45
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,774
<i>I thought that in this age of peace,</i>

46
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,026
there would be no more thrilling fights.

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>He has a point.</i>

48
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,242
<i>This fight is like curse poison.</i>

49
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,037
<i>The longer the bugs are left inside,</i>
<i>the deadlier the last one will be.</i>

50
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,833
<i>But will it really be that easy?</i>

51
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,043
<i>There are more</i>
<i>poisonous insects out there.</i>

52
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,048
<i>If the Government grows impatient,</i>
<i>they'll just bring out the next insect.</i>

53
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,052
<i>One that's stronger, and more poisonous.</i>

54
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,074
Interesting.

55
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,922
Stand back.

56
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,767
<i>What the hell is this thing? A fish?</i>

57
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,272
<i>He's wearing prayer beads,</i>
<i>but is he a monster? A creature?</i>

58
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,108
<i>It looks so unrealistic and ridiculous.</i>

59
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,444
<i>There's so much I don't understand, but…</i>

60
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,738
<i>my instincts are telling me</i>

61
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>that this island is dangerous.</i>

62
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,409
<i>What a pain.</i>

63
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,130
Gabima--!

64
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,053
-I told you to stay back.
-Yes, sir.

65
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,139
<i>It seems… like a creature.</i>

66
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>The Law of the Shinobi, rule number five.</i>

67
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,522
Never face an unknown opponent.

68
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,276
<i>Shall we run?</i>

69
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,905
<i>Together? Or alone?</i>

70
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,420
Gabimaru, are you okay?

71
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,547
<i>This place is dangerous.</i>

72
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,675
I can't believe you're hurt this badly.

73
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,052
That's not what I mean.

74
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,678
Let's get out of here.

75
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,648
<i>What are these things?</i>

76
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,569
<i>They're smiling? Are they real…</i>

77
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,489
<i>Stay calm.</i>

78
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,825
<i>Don't get distracted.</i>

79
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,451
I'm surrounded.

80
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>I've had enough.</i>
<i>Don't think about anything else.</i>

81
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,963
Gabimaru!

82
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,677
Ninja Art, Fire Master!

83
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,186
<i>Don't think about anything else.</i>

84
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,151
<i>Just kill…</i>

85
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,280
<i>to survive.</i>

86
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,617
<i>I'll get pardoned,</i>
<i>and escape from this bloody world.</i>

87
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,662
<i>Just kill.</i>

88
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>I knew this was a dangerous mission.</i>

89
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,628
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

90
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,964
<i>Everything is different now</i>

91
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,675
<i>to how it was just a few hours ago.</i>

92
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,642
<i>Everything I'm seeing…</i>
<i>is very out of this world.</i>

93
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,731
<i>Is this paradise or….?</i>

94
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,288
<i>Don't think about anything else.</i>

95
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,291
<i>That is not weakness.</i>

96
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,543
<i>Just eliminate…</i>

97
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,546
<i>True courage is to follow one's heart.</i>

98
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>…the enemy in front of me.</i>

99
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,479
Um, Gabimaru…

100
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,563
Thank…

101
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,364
Wow!
Did you slaughter these all by yourself?

102
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,283
No one does it like you, Hollow.

103
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,869
You truly are the man. You're amazing!

104
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,913
I'm Yuzuriha.

105
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,792
I'm a ninja just like you.
That makes us buddies.

106
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,586
Why are there two beheaders?

107
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,296
Why did you do that?

108
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,176
When someone helps you,
you say, "thank you."

109
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,431
Thank you for helping.

110
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,352
So? What do you want?

111
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,939
We're fighting against each other.
There's no reason for you to help us.

112
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,360
Don't be so tense.

113
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,320
Look, the monster is gone.

114
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,698
Besides, you seem strong and reliable.

115
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,701
You're bleeding,
but you're still standing.

116
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,203
You were helping that girl just now,
weren't you?

117
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,208
Hey…

118
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,460
Want to work with me?

119
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,965
Being in such a dangerous place,
I'm so scared.

120
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,219
I'll do whatever you say
so please protect me…

121
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,473
Huh? Ow…

122
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,018
Ouch! That hurts!

123
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,311
What the hell?!

124
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,606
Your charm will not work on me.
I know how the girl ninjas do it.

125
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,567
Fine then.

126
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,903
You got me. I was just testing you.

127
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,615
It's better to regret doing something
than not to do it, right?

128
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,410
But I really meant it
when I asked you to work with me.

129
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,204
Five people is better than three, right?

130
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,873
Wait a minute.

131
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,250
Why are there two Asaemon
in the first place?

132
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,003
This guy here is… um…

133
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,714
I'm Yamada Asaemon Genji.

134
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,635
I was originally in charge of
Moro Makiya, the Apostate.

135
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,138
<i>Makiya was tricked by this woman and died.</i>

136
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,099
<i>This is despicable and out of line</i>
<i>with the Warrior Way.</i>

137
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,895
<i>I judged that a single beheader</i>
<i>was not enough to control her.</i>

138
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,522
So I have decided to accompany her.

139
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,984
<i>He fell for her charm.</i>

140
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,402
I see.

141
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,655
<i>Genji has always had a soft spot</i>
<i>for women. He fell in her trap.</i>

142
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,203
I-- I'm originally in charge of her.

143
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,080
My name is Yamada Asaemon Senta.

144
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,958
Well, here's the thing.
Before arriving here,

145
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,212
we encountered strange insects,
monsters, and stone statues.

146
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,672
We know that
this place is pretty dangerous.

147
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,051
It's important to find the elixir
as soon as possible,

148
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,179
but it's no good
if we just rush in and die, right?

149
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,474
You're the one
who called me a disappointment.

150
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,227
Eh, I don't remember saying that.

151
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,647
Well,
if the two parties agree to cooperate,

152
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,357
there should be no problem.

153
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,692
Yay! I love you Gabimaru!

154
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,362
Ow! What the hell?!

155
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,198
I didn't say I'd work with you.
I don't trust female ninjas.

156
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,035
Trust? You think that's important?

157
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,328
This isn't kids play.

158
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,793
We can betray each other anytime.

159
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,589
Even if we find the elixir,
only one of us gets pardoned,

160
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,300
so let's just use each other
until the last minute.

161
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,762
Or are you scared of me?

162
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,180
You're surprisingly naive.

163
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,104
Please, Gabi. Help a weak girl.

164
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,106
I don't have time for that.

165
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,482
Oh, yeah.

166
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,235
What's in it for me?

167
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,739
You give us your strength
and I'll give you intel.

168
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,661
For example, you guys
seem to be worried about the creatures.

169
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,372
But, it's the bugs
that are the real problem here.

170
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,207
<i>Butterflies with human faces.</i>

171
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,378
<i>They're flying around the monster,</i>
<i>but their nests and habits are unknown.</i>

172
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,424
Their scales are supposed to be
hallucinogenic and poisonous.

173
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,384
How do you know that?

174
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,555
<i>Moro Makiya.</i>

175
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,433
<i>After we got close,</i>
<i>I sweet talked him into it</i>

176
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,101
<i>and tested it out on him.</i>

177
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,146
<i>The centipedes are creepy,</i>
<i>but you can leave them alone.</i>

178
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,023
<i>They only eat dead meat.</i>

179
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,691
<i>How do you know?</i>

180
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,234
<i>I tested it on Makiya.</i>

181
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,530
There were other bugs, but as long as
you don't get close, they won't attack.

182
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,199
I tested it on Makiya.

183
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,242
What happened to that guy?

184
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,746
<i>I pretended I was dead,</i>
<i>caught him off guard, and killed him.</i>

185
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,998
Many of the objects worn by the monsters

186
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,542
have a religious design,

187
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,504
and they seem to be derived
from Buddhism or Taoism.

188
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,548
<i>Buddhism and Taoism are</i>
<i>inherently different.</i>

189
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,009
<i>It's strange to see them mixed together.</i>

190
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,470
<i>The Buddha statues are strange too.</i>

191
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,766
<i>To me, this island doesn't seem to be</i>
<i>a paradise at all.</i>

192
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,893
I agree.

193
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,771
It's easy to put it away as a mystery,
but the internal structure

194
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,982
and the texture of the muscles
transmitted from the sword

195
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,400
are those of a living creature.

196
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,403
You see,
there are a ton of things we don't know,

197
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,406
so the first step is to cooperate
and gather information!

198
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,409
I'll tell you everything I know.

199
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,538
Why do you reveal so much information?

200
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,040
You want to survive that badly?

201
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,294
I have only one sister.

202
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,882
<i>She's ill, but…</i>
<i>we had no money for medicine.</i>

203
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,302
I became a ninja to earn money.

204
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,556
<i>I endured hellish training</i>
<i>in the Kasumi Valley of Kai.</i>

205
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,182
<i>Isn't training at Mizore Valley?</i>

206
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,101
<i>Yes, that valley.</i>

207
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,146
<i>So then… by the chief of the village…</i>

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,400
<i>I was told,</i>
<i>You can't do that… something like that.</i>

209
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,443
Then I was kind of betrayed.

210
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,946
Hey, if you're lying, don't talk so long.

211
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,325
You noticed? Do I need a reason

212
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,452
for wanting to live?

213
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,205
Do I need a special reason?

214
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,166
I don't have a reason.

215
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,503
Do I need a reason if I just want to live?

216
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,839
I don't want to die young and empty.

217
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,340
That's it!

218
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,303
Well, maybe samurais can't understand.

219
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,598
They bet their lives
on the Military leader's will,

220
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,517
and don't even question it.

221
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,354
And I want to ask you something else.

222
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,651
What did you really do to that man,
Moro Makiya?

223
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,617
I didn't really do anything.

224
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,579
<i>Are you curious about the lives of others?</i>

225
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,415
If you act like that, you'll die.

226
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,835
Fine then.

227
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,340
I want information too.
It's not cooperation, it's collaboration.

228
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,467
Yes! You're the best Gabi!

229
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,718
Ow! It's hurt!

230
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,846
I just got a little excited!
What the hell are you doing?

231
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,222
I have a wife.

232
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,308
Well, let's get to the information.

233
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,268
No, not yet!

234
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,229
We're allies now, so you don't need to
give out any more info.

235
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,358
Shall I rip out your tongue?

236
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,402
I'm kidding. Just kidding.

237
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,115
<i>What have I accomplished</i>
<i>since coming to this island?</i>

238
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,412
<i>I've been bewildered by these monsters</i>
<i>and this whole situation.</i>

239
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,708
<i>What good has my sword done?</i>

240
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,379
<i>Why am I… so helpless?</i>

241
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,138
The willingness to change is strength.

242
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,685
He's taking over
after only one month of training?

243
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,269
Good job, Toma.

244
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,482
Lastly, you will cut the criminal,
and you will go up in the ranks.

245
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,776
Which place of punishment is the best?

246
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,031
I know of a place.

247
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

248
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,500
I've come to help, Big brother.

249
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,586
You're late!

250
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,048
After a month of infiltrating the
Yamada Clan, and rising to this position,

251
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,550
you're not going to thank me?

252
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,679
I endured
torturous interrogation for a month.

253
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,889
So that's why.
You've become even more handsome.

254
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,891
How do we escape?

255
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,935
It won't be easy to
pass the men in the magistrate's office.

256
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,189
There's a way to avoid being chased.

257
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,568
I'm for it.

258
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,447
<i>Change means changing one's appearance</i>
<i>depending on the situation.</i>

259
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,741
Brother!

260
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,952
<i>It's about understanding the situation</i>
<i>quickly and grasping it.</i>

261
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,830
Is it a creature? What is that?

262
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,125
<i>Sometimes it's hard</i>
<i>to understand the situation.</i>

263
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,297
I can kill it then!

264
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,673
<i>Grasping the situation,</i>

265
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,801
<i>that is my brother's strength.</i>

266
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,720
<i>He could always grasp a situation.</i>

267
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,805
<i>He did when</i>
<i>the feudal lord our father served</i>

268
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,725
<i>committed a crime at Edo Castle</i>

269
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,186
<i>and was ordered to dismantle the clan.</i>

270
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,691
<i>When Mom died of illness due to poverty.</i>

271
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,570
The loyal avengers, the 47 ronin ninja,

272
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,448
all 47 of them shall be beheaded!

273
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,453
<i>Even when my father participated in</i>
<i>the avenging of his lord and was executed.</i>

274
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,756
<i>Even when I was attacked by bandits.</i>

275
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,258
<i>He would grasp the situation,</i>

276
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,845
<i>and take control over it.</i>

277
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,140
It's over! Bandit leader, Chobei!

278
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,893
Come out of there!

279
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,896
Toma, get out of here.

280
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,273
-But, brother!
-Come save me later.

281
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,276
I believe in you.

282
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,282
<i>The world is not about</i>
<i>survival of the fittest.</i>

283
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>The fittest survive.</i>
<i>Those who adapt are the strongest.</i>

284
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,919
-Brother…
-Toma, let's get these monsters!

285
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,045
Yes!

286
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,425
<i>If he can't grasp the situation,</i>
<i>he may run, but always adapts again.</i>

287
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,804
<i>You're a genius at adapting.</i>

288
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,682
<i>The only thing that remains the same is…</i>

289
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,064
Brother!

290
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,529
<i>The willingness to change is strength.</i>

291
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,867
<i>We don't need things…</i>

292
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,286
<i>that never change.</i>

293
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:27,249
<i>That's why you're strong, brother.</i>

294
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,668
You monster!

295
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,045
You'll never get past this point!

296
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:41,638
A monster's weapon is effective
against monsters.

297
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,764
Brother!

298
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,435
Thanks to you, I was able to take it down.

299
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,439
Brother!

300
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,692
Brother! Are you okay?

301
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,488
Killing is a sin.

302
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,243
Insects are living creatures.

303
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,120
Fish are living as well.

304
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,456
-These things talk?
-You shall not hurt them.

305
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,582
Killing is a sin.

306
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,002
Brother. Are these… real gods?

307
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,131
This place is hell, not paradise.

308
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,759
A place where sinners are punished.

309
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,557
<i>The sins of the lord</i>
<i>are the sins of his subjects.</i>

310
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,184
<i>You are condemned to death!</i>

311
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,895
<i>Seize the deadly criminal Chobei!</i>

312
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,652
Shut up! Sin, sin, sin, you say!

313
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,280
Whether it's evil or sin,

314
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,034
I don't give a damn!
You guys decided that, didn't you?!

315
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,412
Follow righteousness? You slaves!

316
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,415
You greedy puppets!

317
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,877
I will not be interfered with any longer!

318
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,964
I'll do what I want!

319
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,509
I'm my own master.

320
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,262
I'm my own god!

321
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
<i>Your willingness to change</i>
<i>is your strength.</i>

322
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:11,019
<i>Because you change, you stand out.</i>

323
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,772
<i>You have an ego that will never break.</i>

324
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,276
Dad… Mom…

325
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,279
I want to go home.

326
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,616
The child of a samurai is now a bandit.

327
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,329
I don't know what's right anymore.

328
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,289
I don't know what's right.

329
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,423
Don't cry, Toma.
If you show weakness, you will die!

330
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,676
If you don't know what's right,
then trust only me.

331
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,014
I'm your elder brother! I'm your guide!

332
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,182
I am always right.

333
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,105
If such monsters are real,

334
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,190
then the story of the elixir must be true.

335
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,989
I've made up my mind. I'm going to kill
all of them, monsters and criminals alike.

336
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,200
Then the search for the elixir
will be unobstructed.

337
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,746
We will drink the elixir we find.

338
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,498
No one can interfere with our way of life,

339
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,209
not even death!

340
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,799
Will it really go that easily?

341
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,009
Huh?

342
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,927
This is a dangerous island.

343
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>Whatever we face,</i>

344
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,682
<i>we will have survived this predicament.</i>

345
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,935
<i>That's how much of a threat this place is.</i>

346
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,023
<i>The weak will be eliminated.</i>

347
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,906
