1
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:16,641
<i>For as long as I can remember, I've</i>
<i>been told the same thing my whole life.</i>

2
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,770
-Scum.
-Bastard.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,688
Good-for-nothing.

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,818
<i>I was born and raised in the slums.</i>

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>My parents didn't have</i>
<i>the time or energy to feed me.</i>

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,833
<i>When I was hungry, I stole, I robbed,</i>

7
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,419
<i>and did everything but kill.</i>

8
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,634
<i>I slept when I wanted to,</i>

9
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,721
<i>and woke up when I felt like it.</i>

10
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,019
<i>I was free.</i>

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,858
Hey! Watch where you're going!

12
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,818
Oh, a vagrant. You piece of scum.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,788
I beg you, please, stop.

14
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,295
That's enough.

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,632
Who the hell are you?

16
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,236
Even if we wander the beach aimlessly,

17
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,156
we'll never spot a current leading out.

18
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,075
This sun and sand
are just going to drain us.

19
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,911
Enough with the logic!

20
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,830
I may be an idiot but I'm trying
to do what's best for us.

21
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,541
The forest is full
of bugs and monsters, right?

22
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,418
But together, we can beat them.

23
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,796
Knowing that you are a girl,
I want to avoid such danger.

24
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,175
Please, be my husband after all!

25
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,676
It's too soon for that.

26
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,513
First, we need to get out of here alive.
Then you can think about marriage.

27
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,225
Let's take our time
and come up with a safe strategy.

28
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,185
Combat is to be studiously avoided.

29
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,687
You're very discreet.
That'll make a good husband.

30
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,075
Wh… Who are you?
Did you just come from the sky?

31
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,911
There was so much commotion in the forest.

32
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,329
That is unusual.

33
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,333
I saw many Soshin corpses.

34
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,377
Which is also unusual.

35
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,588
Did you guys do this?

36
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,590
It's turned into a man.

37
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,968
It's a monster! Run!

38
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,970
Why do you run?

39
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,725
It's useless.

40
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,738
I don't mind, but…
doesn't it make you curious?

41
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,991
When something is out of the ordinary,

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,743
I don't like it.

43
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,589
Wow… you move around a lot, for a human.

44
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,605
You're swift too. For a human.

45
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,859
Nurugai!

46
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,487
Run on my signal!

47
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,614
Don't think about defeating it, just run!

48
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,992
I may not have stamina but…

49
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,997
no one can beat my swordplay speed!

50
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,929
Now!

51
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,825
My clothes are torn.

52
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,956
This is awful.

53
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,679
M… Master!

54
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,973
Run! Tenza!

55
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,266
Yes, sir!

56
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,065
Who was that?

57
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:43,361
He's Yamada Asaemon Shion, my teacher!

58
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,571
He's lost his eyesight,

59
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,199
but he's running through the forest.

60
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,785
He can "see" through smell and sounds.

61
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,170
We're far from it now.

62
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,172
Mister Nurugai… I mean Miss.

63
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,967
With my teacher here,
there's no need to worry.

64
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,971
Lord Shion is my savior
and a master swordsman!

65
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,223
He's an amazing person!

66
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,016
About your swordplay…

67
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,519
Too focused on speed,
so your technique is sloppy.

68
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,605
You need to aim
for the neck or legs first.

69
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,233
And I could hear your messy footwork.

70
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,735
Every strike must
be executed with great care.

71
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,780
Even at a time like this,
you're still a teacher, aren't you?

72
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,116
I'm actually kind of relieved.

73
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,493
Your carelessness can't be fixed either.

74
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,911
Still…

75
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:38,207
Glad you're safe. I thought
I'd seen the last of you on the ship.

76
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,710
You're full of wit.

77
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,131
What are you doing here out alone, sir?

78
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,636
<i>I had finished my duty</i>
<i>and I was heading to return.</i>

79
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,147
I couldn't find
any ocean currents off the island,

80
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,191
so I was searching around.

81
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,525
Just like us.

82
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,820
There was one spot that looked like
it had an outgoing current.

83
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,739
But…

84
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,743
<i>I've never heard such a sound or presence.</i>

85
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,705
I'm blind, so I have my limits.

86
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,917
I was looking for someone
to return with me.

87
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,169
Please, take us there!

88
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,421
The three of us can make it work!

89
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
Perhaps we can.

90
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,300
But before that…

91
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,016
What are you doing… Master?

92
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,060
It's your turn to explain.

93
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,811
Why are you protecting a sinner?

94
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,564
If there's a rule violation
or something unexpected,

95
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,567
you'll be told to execute
the sinner immediately.

96
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,070
That is what I did.

97
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,784
<i>I killed the sinner</i>
<i>who tried to seduce me.</i>

98
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,790
<i>I did it the least painful way possible.</i>

99
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,545
You seem to have
a soft spot for that sinner.

100
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,213
Tell me the reason.

101
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,883
Depending on that,
I will execute them myself.

102
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,553
This child… has not committed any crime.

103
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,306
The contents of the sinners' profiles
are all in my head.

104
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,309
I'm well aware of their backgrounds.

105
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,936
But a crime is…

106
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,689
decided by the era we live in, Tenza.

107
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>We, the Yamada Asaemon</i>
<i>are swords for this era to wield.</i>

108
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,322
<i>It is out of order for a sword</i>
<i>to choose who it cuts.</i>

109
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,449
<i>Above all, if you</i>
<i>break the rules, it could</i>

110
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,952
be seen as a rebellion
against the entire Yamada Clan.

111
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,455
One man's actions can
endanger the entire clan.

112
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,460
But, you taught me
how to use the sword, Master.

113
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,213
<i>I was a self-reliant wanderer.</i>

114
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,091
<i>You had no obligation to take me in,</i>

115
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,968
<i>but you did, Master.</i>

116
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:58,222
That's because I saw
talent and potential in you.

117
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,558
I can say the same too!

118
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,351
I see potential in a world

119
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,353
where this child can live freely!

120
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,940
Those are some wise words.

121
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,609
I learned from you!

122
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,572
Also, I know that you are a kind man.

123
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,450
I knew you would listen
if I spoke from my heart.

124
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,128
Helping others? I don't get it.

125
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,716
Well, if you insist that much.

126
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,884
I knew it!

127
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,637
See! He's a good person after all!

128
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,888
Right…

129
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,390
I'll allow it for now, but…

130
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,477
If protecting her puts the Yamada Clan

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,021
or you in danger…

132
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,856
Then at that time, I will…

133
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,984
-What is it?
-How did you know?

134
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,527
That she was a girl?

135
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,864
It's obvious. I have an eye
for these kind of things.

136
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,283
You really do like those kind of jokes.

137
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,787
Pleased to meet you, Master.

138
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,539
Pleased to meet you, too, Nurugai.

139
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,459
But there is no need for you
to call me Master.

140
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,462
I haven't taught you anything yet.

141
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,801
All right! Let's go
to the ocean currents you mentioned!

142
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,052
Keep it down.

143
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,304
Do this carefully, no rush.

144
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,849
<i>The danger at hand is</i>
<i>that monster from earlier.</i>

145
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,601
<i>It's hard to believe it's human.</i>

146
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,354
Let's think about what to do
when we encounter it.

147
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,525
If we're going to run from it,
we can just do like we did before.

148
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,112
It seems I've been taken for a fool.

149
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,953
You're a life saver, Master.

150
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,870
Thanks.

151
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,123
Master!

152
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,751
Huh? I thought I sliced off your head.

153
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,378
You're pretty tough.

154
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,801
Take that!

155
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm used to that already.

156
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:08,227
The truth is, you won't
become "tan" unless you're alive.

157
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,729
But you piss me off, so die.

158
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,442
<i>What should we do? Should we run?</i>

159
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,237
<i>No, I have to fight.</i>

160
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,995
One Cut Secret Technique…

161
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,580
Wait, Ten--

162
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,375
Roaring Rain!

163
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,300
I told you that I'm used to this.

164
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,854
Tenza!

165
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,742
Hey Master, why did ya take in
some punk kid like me?

166
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,619
Try asking more properly.

167
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,039
Why did ya take me in?

168
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,000
Our job is to end lives.

169
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,337
<i>So I prefer to spend the rest</i>
<i>of my time helping others.</i>

170
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,965
Well, at times you can be a little rough.

171
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,761
But at your core, I see potential.

172
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,347
Are you a saint?

173
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,016
Helping others? I don't get it.

174
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,269
Take that!

175
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,398
Dammit!

176
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,319
Your swordplay is sloppy.
You're too driven by emotion.

177
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,822
I can sense anger and… hesitation.

178
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,409
It's not like I want to be a samurai.

179
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,411
This is all pointless.

180
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,706
I'm not asking you to be
a samurai from the start.

181
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,002
But if one day…
you have something to protect,

182
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,798
I'm sure the sword you've trained with
will help you.

183
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,133
Something to protect?

184
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,554
Look at that cherry blossom tree.

185
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,515
The trunk is thin
and the flowers are still buds.

186
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,561
But a bud has all kinds of potential.

187
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,813
Just like you.

188
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:20,192
The time will surely come
when this bud of potential blossoms.

189
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,319
-Scum.
-Bastard.

190
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,612
-Good-for-nothing.
-Vagrant.

191
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,408
Okay, let's continue.

192
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,742
I don't have any…

193
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,620
possibilities. None!

194
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,124
I have no identity nor money!

195
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,128
From the day I was born,
I've had no potential!

196
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,465
-I quit.
-What?

197
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,925
I said I quit!

198
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,219
I'm tired of this rigid lifestyle!

199
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,555
I'm going to live how I want!

200
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,725
-Are you serious?
-Damn right!

201
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,352
Then, I have one condition.

202
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,979
One condition?

203
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,564
Beat me just once.

204
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,150
It can be any time and day.

205
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,819
Beat me once.

206
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,573
When you do, I'll allow you to quit.

207
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,662
I don't have time for this.

208
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,585
Where are you going?
The dojo is on the other side.

209
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,212
Shion has told me about you.

210
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,590
Were you able to beat him?

211
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,426
Are you trying to take me back?

212
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,844
Do what you want.

213
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:33,057
But, at least join me on a walk.

214
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,684
I woke up early and have nothing to do.

215
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,195
TAKE REFUGE IN AMIDA BUTSU

216
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,488
The one who rests here is…

217
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,991
the man who used to be Shion's disciple.

218
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,993
<i>His name was Tesshin.</i>

219
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,954
A disciple?

220
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,665
Like you, he was a man of bad behavior.

221
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,751
He had the talent, but lacked will power.

222
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,380
I'm sure Master gave him a hard time then?

223
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,381
Just like me.

224
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,011
Back then, Shion was
obsessed with improving his skills.

225
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,181
He wasn't as eager to teach as he is now.

226
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,935
<i>Eventually, Tesshin said</i>
<i>"I'll live my life the way I want to,"</i>

227
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,687
<i>and he left the dojo.</i>

228
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,606
For a while, nothing changed.

229
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,442
That day was the same as usual.

230
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,695
Shion went out to do his job.

231
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,155
<i>He stood in front of the sinner.</i>

232
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,869
<i>Shion raised his sword,</i>

233
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,163
<i>but he couldn't bring it down.</i>

234
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,999
Do you mean that…

235
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,418
Yes. Shion realized that,

236
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,421
<i>the sinner in front of him was Tesshin.</i>

237
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,215
After Tesshin left the dojo,

238
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,094
he soon found it hard to make ends meet,
so he began committing crimes.

239
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,180
What did Master do?

240
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,684
<i>He cut him, of course.</i>
<i>As a Yamada Asaemon.</i>

241
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,188
<i>Shion clearly heard Tesshin's last words.</i>

242
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,691
<i>He said to him,</i>

243
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,945
<i>"I'm sorry, Master."</i>

244
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,156
After that,

245
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,908
Shion became passionate
about teaching his younger disciples

246
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,119
and started helping others.

247
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,455
If you live your life as an outlaw,

248
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,540
you might eventually end up like him.

249
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,419
Shion doesn't want you
to go down that same path.

250
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,842
<i>Just like you. The time will surely come</i>
<i>when this bud of potential blossoms.</i>

251
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,135
What are you going to do?

252
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,847
Are you going to walk away
without beating him once?

253
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,858
Tenzaka.

254
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,278
Master, I want you to train with me.

255
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,290
Oh, it looks like you are
not the man you were.

256
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:09,296
<i>I've never been serious</i>
<i>about anything until now. But…</i>

257
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,471
Your defense is weak!

258
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,474
Once more!

259
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,435
Once more!

260
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,271
Again!

261
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,982
Keep it going!

262
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,111
<i>I want to beat him at least once.</i>

263
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,577
<i>This man was the first</i>
<i>to believe in my potential.</i>

264
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,913
<i>Hey, Master…</i>

265
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,625
<i>Do you think I can believe</i>
<i>in my own potential?</i>

266
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,129
<i>And as you once said to me… I wonder if…</i>

267
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,174
<i>I wonder if I'll ever have</i>
<i>someone I want to protect.</i>

268
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,606
<i>My fingertips are getting cold…</i>

269
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,859
<i>But from the chest up,</i>

270
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,778
<i>it feels burning hot.</i>

271
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,406
<i>Oh, I see…</i>

272
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,159
<i>Am I going to die?</i>

273
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,162
<i>Is everyone going to die here?</i>

274
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,665
<i>Are we all going to be killed</i>
<i>by this monster?</i>

275
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,968
<i>I won't let you!</i>

276
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,766
<i>Even if I die, I'll make sure</i>
<i>the other two get away!</i>

277
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,643
<i>I'll do whatever it takes!</i>

278
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,522
<i>I'll give all I have to buy them time!</i>

279
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,824
<i>Don't come over here.</i>

280
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,578
<i>Run! Please, get out of here.</i>

281
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,633
<i>Please, run, you two.</i>

282
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,845
<i>No, Master. You can't win.</i>

283
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,347
<i>You know it, don't you?</i>

284
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,600
<i>It got my throat. I can't even speak.</i>

285
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,770
<i>Master, please, just run!</i>

286
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,065
<i>Please, let me say… one word.</i>

287
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,999
Tenzo! No!

288
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>Master, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>After all you have done for me.</i>

289
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,275
<i>Nurugai, please, live. You have potential.</i>

290
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:23,240
<i>Potential… I wonder</i>
<i>what kind I might've had?</i>

291
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,296
So persistent.

292
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,435
Why did you abandon him? I'm going back!

293
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,939
Th… This is what Tenza wanted.

294
00:21:56,023 --> 00:22:00,193
But you're his teacher, aren't you?

295
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,446
-And he's your disciple, right?
-That's why!

296
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,950
We are comrades with the same resolve.

297
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,704
What he did for us

298
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,456
must not go to waste.

299
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,709
We can't beat that thing now.

300
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:19,463
We would have all been dead.
We had to pull out.

301
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,465
But I promise,

302
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,967
we will make it pay!

303
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,499
Yes, I beat you!

304
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,294
Good job. Now, you can do as you like.

305
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,884
Master, please, continue to teach me…

306
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,388
I mean… Master, please, continue
to teach me the way of the sword,

307
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,766
I beg you!

308
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,434
Of course.

309
