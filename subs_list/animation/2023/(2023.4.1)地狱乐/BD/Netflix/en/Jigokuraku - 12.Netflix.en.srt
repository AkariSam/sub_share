1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,419
WELCOME

2
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,846
Well, this is amazing!

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,349
It might be the first time
a human has made it this far.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,101
In at least 1,000 years.

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,603
A human?

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,231
Not a human… Shit.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,901
Oh dear.

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,154
Don't run.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,489
I'm not planning to kill you…

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,032
Yet.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,659
<i>He's so strong…</i>

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,035
How did he--?

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>I know why she ran.</i>

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,082
<i>Compared to the other monsters,</i>
<i>he's clearly…</i>

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,751
<i>much stronger.</i>

16
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,923
Let go of her.

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,925
<i>Sagirin…</i>

18
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,552
Don't glower at me that like.

19
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,888
I just want to have
a little chat with you.

20
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,890
What are you?

21
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,184
It's Lord Tensen.

22
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,144
This person is…

23
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,481
The Peony Sprite… Enthroned Amoghavajra.

24
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,825
He is… Lord Tensen…

25
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,661
Hoko… You're alive?

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,789
That won't kill him.

27
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,334
It'll only speed up Arborification.
Once he's fully a tree, he's done.

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,335
No!

29
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,338
It is regrettable,
but it is the will of the gods…

30
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,257
I can only pray that my soul

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,843
will be invited to Horai.

32
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,636
Just so you know,

33
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,556
all that about Amoghavajra
and souls and stuff…

34
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,600
It's all fake.

35
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,809
What?

36
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,394
Or maybe more of an expedient.

37
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,355
We had to create order
on the island, so we made a religion.

38
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,317
This island is an experiment on life.

39
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,652
You and everything else on this island

40
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,780
were simply test subjects
born from experiments.

41
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,240
That can't be…

42
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,660
And the humans who come
to this island are all,

43
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,746
in the end, materials for research.

44
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,498
These are Kiyoshi.

45
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,125
I made them from humans.

46
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,878
They're made from… humans?

47
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,131
Yep. They were originally
humans who came to the island.

48
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,636
I just love to tinker around and figure
out how I can play with each one.

49
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,512
It's kind of funny, isn't it?

50
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,975
But this wasn't
the original plan for the humans.

51
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,311
Good quality humans become Tan.

52
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,938
Tan…

53
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,481
That's the elixir, right?

54
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,233
The elixir?

55
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,237
All the humans who've come here
have talked about the same thing.

56
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,530
The elixir of life…

57
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,493
The fountain of youth…
Ambrosia, food of the gods…

58
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,372
I'm sorry to say we don't
have anything like that here.

59
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,292
Tan may be indispensable to us,

60
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,087
but any human who drinks it
will simply Arborify.

61
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,589
The Hoko and the flower people
are almost immortal,

62
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,799
but not eternally young.

63
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,301
My colleagues are looking into that,

64
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,011
but the solution will take a while.

65
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,471
Either way,

66
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,057
we don't have what you're
looking for on this island.

67
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,560
<i>There's no… elixir?</i>

68
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>So, what's going to happen to him?</i>

69
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,150
<i>Without the elixir he won't get a pardon…</i>

70
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,779
So, it's the end of the road for you all.

71
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,073
Why don't you just be good
and come with me?

72
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,201
There's a lot of things
I want to try with you…

73
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,079
<i>Ninja Art: Body Replacement.</i>

74
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,549
That's enough to kill any kind of monster.

75
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,009
Just the henchmen left.

76
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,220
But why are they spacing out like that?

77
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,430
Might as well run now!

78
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,348
Sagirin!

79
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,183
Uh… Right.

80
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,772
Thanks for your help earlier.

81
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,983
Even though I ran away.

82
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,610
Were you shocked about the elixir?

83
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,029
I totally get it!

84
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,572
But you know…

85
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,199
The priority is staying alive.

86
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,494
As long as we're alive,
we can manage everything else.

87
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,329
Let's focus on doing that.

88
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,291
Change your mindset. Now, we run!

89
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,209
Right!

90
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,088
-Senta, hurry up!
-Ah, okay!

91
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,091
I like you. You have talent.

92
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,845
But you're not quite right.

93
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,847
The Kiyoshi aren't my henchmen.

94
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,354
They're my toys.

95
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,106
See, that was funny, right?

96
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,360
You dodged it. You must have good eyes.

97
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,530
Or rather… Can you actually see Tao?

98
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,825
It's the first time I've
ever heard the word "Tao."

99
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,495
At my old haunt,
they used to call it "Qi."

100
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,164
But it looks like you can't use it yet.

101
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,583
I suppose I might as well teach you--

102
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,001
Please wait!

103
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,712
If it has to do with her life or death,

104
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,506
it must go through me.

105
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,300
I have a job to do too…

106
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,259
TAMESHI ITTORYO FIFTH RANK
YAMADA ASAEMON SENTA

107
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,137
The other two looked
like they have potential.

108
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,640
If yours is the same, that's fine.

109
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,141
Ninja girl,

110
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,644
I'm going to teach you how to use Tao.

111
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,355
If you're talented enough,
we could do Bochu Justu…

112
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,024
<i>or you'll become a high-quality Tan.</i>

113
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,735
Looks like you're his favorite.

114
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,403
-Right?
-Shut up.

115
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>To think that Senta</i>
<i>would be so quick to draw…</i>

116
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,034
<i>And for a criminal, no less…</i>

117
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,536
<i>I wonder…</i>

118
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,704
<i>If he has some special feelings for her…</i>

119
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,375
I don't care about
anyone but the ninja girl.

120
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,377
So get out of my way.

121
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,841
Sagirin!

122
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,093
Forget about her.

123
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,386
What I just did was Toate.

124
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,847
It's a technique where you
collect Tao and throw it,

125
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,057
but humans can't learn it,

126
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,392
so just forget about it.

127
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,145
I'd rather you just start with the bas--

128
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,147
Oh?

129
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,527
Don't interfere, fatty.

130
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,447
I believe I told you to speak through me.

131
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,158
-Besides…
-He's right, Senta. You are interfering!

132
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,872
Since he just won't die,

133
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,665
he can test me all he wants.

134
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,960
<i>Ninja Art: Sticky String!</i>

135
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,465
<i>I metabolized a potion</i>
<i>within my body and secreted it out.</i>

136
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,966
<i>It's my own personal ninja art.</i>

137
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,468
<i>That's an acidic snake poison.</i>

138
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,721
<i>Ninja Art: Honey Prison.</i>

139
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,724
<i>And then… Ninja Art: Line Cutting!</i>

140
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,484
You know, you just made use of Tao.

141
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,987
No ordinary human could
metabolize poisonous liquids.

142
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,574
But your use of Tao is ambiguous.

143
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,951
You need to polish your technique.

144
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,246
If we don't let his eyes grow back
we might have a chance!

145
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,373
Oh, I see.

146
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

147
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,252
Let's try it like this for a bit.

148
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,679
Senta, get out of the way!

149
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,431
You get out of the way!

150
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,190
Tao is a sensation…

151
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,983
You wear it like clothing,

152
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,194
and then feel it in everything around you.

153
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,448
If you can't use it, then it's
out of reach for humanity after all.

154
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,451
You'd be no match for us.

155
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,078
Now, then…

156
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,081
Welcome to Horai.

157
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,084
<i>How do we face a monster like this?</i>

158
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,464
Hoko, is there anything…

159
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,550
Does Lord Tensen have any weaknesses?

160
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,677
He is a god.

161
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,721
If this is divine punishment,
then I will accept it.

162
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,349
I sympathize from the bottom of my heart.

163
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,519
But at this rate, we will all die,

164
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,437
and you will never see Mei again!

165
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,984
Any clue at all would do…

166
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
Your Body Replacement thing…

167
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,322
You used Tao for that too.

168
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,366
And it has the same properties as mine.

169
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,909
Interesting!

170
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,204
I didn't know you could get
close to Hojutsu with self-study.

171
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,832
Well, I think it's time
to kill the fat guy.

172
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,876
You recovered fast.

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,628
But there's nothing you can do.

174
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,923
You only have average amounts of Tao.

175
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,344
Read your opponent's intentions
through their movements!

176
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,097
Yes! However, if there's no
intent to his movement…

177
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,643
Cut him down from his Tanden!

178
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,314
According to legend…

179
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,108
<i>Tao is born from the Tanden,</i>

180
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,570
<i>flows over the whole body,</i>
<i>and returns to the Tanden.</i>

181
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,989
If you eradicate it, surely…

182
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,326
Close, but I'm telling you,
you can't do it.

183
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,662
First of all, you don't have enough Tao,

184
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,831
so I'll just regenerate
any wounds you give me.

185
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,084
No human, certainly not any here,

186
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:31,339
even the ninja girl, can handle
enough Tao to kill me.

187
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,802
<i>Now that I've seen it up close,</i>
<i>I've got it.</i>

188
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,888
<i>I believe it's the same.</i>

189
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,275
<i>I knew it! I can read his movements!</i>

190
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,612
<i>What was that?</i>

191
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,281
<i>The amount of Tao</i>
<i>is controlled by the mind…</i>

192
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,658
<i>But she can manifest it in an instant?</i>

193
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,995
<i>But that's not what's important.</i>

194
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>Could this woman… possibly…?</i>

195
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,749
Yuzuriha!

196
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,918
I know. That wound…

197
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,837
It's not regenerating.

198
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,387
When I got close to him,

199
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,514
I felt a special aura.

200
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,766
If that's Tao…

201
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,060
I know how to kill him.

202
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,313
I've felt the same aura from Gabimaru…

203
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,856
<i>And at other times…</i>

204
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,651
<i>From Rokurota, the Giant of Bizen…</i>

205
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,279
Were they using Tao?

206
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,823
It's just a hypothesis, but…

207
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,950
<i>In order to wound him,</i>

208
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,160
<i>you'd need more than</i>
<i>a normal amount of Tao.</i>

209
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,331
<i>And Sagirin can temporarily increase</i>
<i>her Tao through breath control…</i>

210
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,625
<i>But that's not all.</i>

211
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,169
<i>The reason why Tensen can't regenerate…</i>

212
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,465
Leave this to me!

213
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,260
That's an unusual kind of Tao…

214
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,055
And it's poisonous to me?

215
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,224
That's awesome!

216
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,977
<i>What will I make out of you?</i>

217
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,439
<i>Or… will you kill me?</i>

218
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,400
Wait, Sagiri!

219
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,318
He's strong.

220
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,154
The three of us should work together.

221
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,201
<i>Hojutsu: Earth Yin…</i>

222
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,828
<i>Night Pilgrim.</i>

223
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,163
He's gone--!

224
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,834
He's not gone!

225
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,087
He's just made his Tao
so faint we can't sense him!

226
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,214
It's the same trick as Body Replacement!

227
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,841
Do it now!

228
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,261
<i>Calm the heart… Stillness</i>
<i>and Movement… Coexisting…</i>

229
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,181
Kiyoshi! Kill the ninja woman!

230
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,605
Thanks, Senta!

231
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,814
We're a team, right?

232
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,653
Oopsie-daisy!

233
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,907
Teamwork! Thanks, Senta!

234
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,824
Sure…

235
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,910
Oops.

236
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,120
I can read your movement.

237
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,331
Plus, you're easy
to dodge between breaths.

238
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>My breathing… I'm exhausted!</i>

239
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,084
<i>I can't keep this up…</i>

240
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,050
Nice teamwork.

241
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,516
<i>Now's my chance…</i>

242
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,767
Naive.

243
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,146
<i>He's… Flying?</i>

244
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,399
<i>Hojutsu: Earth Yang - Sky Pilgrim.</i>

245
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,069
By interfering with
the Tao in the atmosphere,

246
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,655
I can create footholds in the air.

247
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,532
Well, naturally,

248
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,784
if you don't know how it works…

249
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,203
I might look no different from a god.

250
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,789
Here's another way to use Tao.

251
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,416
<i>Senjutsu: Tin Splinter.</i>

252
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,925
How am I supposed to fight this?!

253
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,635
Senta!

254
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,766
<i>My vision's getting hazy…</i>

255
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,770
<i>That breathing pattern is stealing</i>
<i>more than my physical strength.</i>

256
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,398
<i>I don't know how much more I can take…</i>

257
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,025
It's too early to quit, Sagirin!

258
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,402
This all shows

259
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,821
that she's hiding her panic.

260
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,657
She always dodges your attacks.

261
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,410
I think there's some kind
of compatibility with Tao,

262
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,121
and yours might be a weakness for her.

263
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,039
But… That monster…

264
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,209
Exactly! She's a monster. She's not a god.

265
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,669
So… we can kill her!

266
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,047
I'll restrain her, so you cut her down!

267
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,175
You're quite… positive.

268
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,552
Of course I am.

269
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,054
Since I don't plan on dying today.

270
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,514
Not one bit!

271
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,018
It's useless.

272
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,771
Yuzuriha!

273
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,649
Can't you dodge them?

274
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,359
You'll die, you know.

275
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,581
Come down, fake god!

276
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,751
I'll kill anyone who…

277
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,002
messes with my life!

278
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,129
I'd even a kill a real god!

279
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,133
Sagirin, now!

280
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,885
Okay!

281
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,681
That woman…

282
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,141
is so irritating.

283
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,143
Nice work, Yuzuriha.

284
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,858
Now he shouldn't be able
to move, regeneration or not.

285
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,819
Don't tell me you plan to die with me?

286
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,614
Hang him by a thread, Sagiri!

287
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,657
I'm on it!

288
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,299
Looks like… he's not moving.

289
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,135
Seems we were right about his weak spot.

290
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,179
That was a gamble.

291
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,181
We did it, you and me.

292
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,265
What about me…?

293
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,770
Hoko…

294
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,480
How are you?

295
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm not… a tree yet…

296
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,693
I'm glad.

297
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,486
I don't want to think about

298
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,780
how there's six other monsters like this.

299
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,533
<i>What mysterious black magic Tao is.</i>

300
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,412
<i>He was even stronger than Hoko said…</i>
<i>surpassing human intelligence.</i>

301
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,331
<i>What is this strange fatigue?</i>

302
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:43,168
<i>Did we really take down</i>
<i>a Lord Tensen that easily?</i>

303
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>More importantly…</i>

304
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,507
The fact that the elixir doesn't
exist is also a problem…

305
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,760
<i>What do we do now?</i>

306
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,763
We have to do something.

307
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,933
If it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist.
Let's think of another plan.

308
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,729
Aww, my skin is all dry.

309
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,440
But look… There are all made of gold!

310
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,859
Do you think we could
bring all this back instead?

311
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,945
Let's… rest a moment.

312
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,280
Alright…

313
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,161
Yuzuriha's utterly indefatigable.

314
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:23,167
Senta, you have
feelings for her, don't you?

315
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,461
Ah, no… Not…

316
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,546
Umm…

317
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:32,176
Well, I… can't help but feel
jealous of her sense of freedom.

318
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,554
That is something well beyond my ability.

319
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,139
What do you mean?

320
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,353
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>I wanted to be a painter.</i>

321
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,106
<i>But… the men in every</i>
<i>generation of my family</i>

322
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,984
<i>traditionally become students</i>
<i>of the Yamada Clan.</i>

323
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,278
<i>I could not break that tradition.</i>

324
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,697
In truth, I hated…

325
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,116
<i>being a Yamada, and being an executioner.</i>

326
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,036
I despised killing people.

327
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,916
<i>For a long time, I tried</i>
<i>to justify the murders.</i>

328
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,753
<i>That's why I know so much about religions,</i>
<i>from my search for answers.</i>

329
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,714
<i>The irony is that</i>
<i>they deemed me hardworking,</i>

330
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,966
<i>and my rank kept going up.</i>

331
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,179
<i>Eventually, I gave up, buried my feelings…</i>

332
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,057
<i>And decided to simply fulfill my role.</i>

333
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,727
You know, you talk like you don't care

334
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,979
about your duty or your house.

335
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,397
Ah, n… no!

336
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,109
You can't hide it.
It's obvious, tanuki boy!

337
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,569
<i>Then I met her…</i>

338
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,447
<i>Her eyes that could see right through me,</i>

339
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,909
<i>and her many cold</i>
<i>and brutal deeds bewildered me.</i>

340
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,663
And so… I don't know why,

341
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,207
but I, who'd been lying
to myself this whole time,

342
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,627
met her, who could only lie to others…

343
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,172
She was so free and bright…

344
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,925
I get so jealous I want to cry.

345
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,137
She must have used ninja arts on me.

346
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,890
What kind of Asaemon admires a criminal?

347
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,311
<i>No…</i>

348
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,521
I think…

349
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,026
I can understand your feelings a little…

350
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,695
Just a little.

351
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,698
Why don't the two of us find a way

352
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,326
to help everyone that came to the island?

353
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,370
Sagiri…

354
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,830
Okay!

355
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,337
<i>I managed to sense Tao…</i>

356
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,673
<i>But I don't think I can use it well.</i>

357
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,133
And also…

358
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,094
We can't learn anything
about the elixir if you kill them.

359
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
Ah.

360
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,097
Well, I'd guess from the conversation

361
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,599
that she knows the answer.

362
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,019
It would be cruel to ask
her to take us to it,

363
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,564
considering what the monsters
wanted to do with her.

364
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,695
But you were the one who came after me.

365
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,779
Right?

366
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,115
What was your goal?

367
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,451
If you have something to ask me, ask.

368
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,786
I owe you for saving me twice.

369
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,915
<i>Sagi wrote in her report…</i>

370
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,501
This man… is not a heartless person.

371
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,337
However, he only reveals his heart…

372
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,632
<i>when the situation pertains</i>
<i>to a certain person.</i>

373
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,718
<i>"Any other situation would be unusual."</i>

374
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,763
<i>Or so she wrote… But, my impression</i>

375
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,056
<i>is drastically different.</i>

376
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,225
<i>That softness…</i>

377
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,560
<i>What does it mean in this position?</i>

378
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,271
Hey!

379
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,274
What…?

380
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,861
Hey…

381
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,990
Were there this many
flowers blooming before?

382
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,079
Yuzuriha!

383
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,267
<i>She's indiscreet…</i>

384
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,102
<i>Cruel…</i>

385
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,439
<i>A murderer girl drowning in sin…</i>

386
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,819
<i>A strong wind that blew away</i>
<i>all of my common sense.</i>

387
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,032
<i>I can't get close.</i>

388
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,535
<i>I don't have to.</i>

389
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,537
<i>If I could only…</i>

390
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,665
<i>continue watching her from the sidelines…</i>

391
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,714
Wait… Was I supposed to be painting now?

392
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,884
I feel like I was in the middle
of doing something else…

393
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,471
Oh well! I'm going to paint another one!

394
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,517
Oh… well…

395
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,854
I… gon… ain…

396
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,457
Kill?

397
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,208
Kill!

398
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,419
Yuzuriha…

399
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,379
Wh… What should we…?

400
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,715
Are we going…

401
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,800
to fight this monster again?

402
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,970
No… I don't think it's possible now…

403
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,906
