1
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:19,728
<i>They are beautiful… but</i>
<i>what are they doing in a place like this?</i>

2
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,232
Why are there humans here?

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,235
Where are the Soshin?

4
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,992
You act like you're not a human.

5
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,995
Are you guys monsters too?

6
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,247
How cute.

7
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,753
Why don't you guys… come and join us?

8
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,004
Join you?

9
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,922
Don't say such a disgusting thing.

10
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,885
Sorry. It's just that it's been a while
since a human has entered here.

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,344
Ugh!

12
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,640
I was in the middle of something good.

13
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,392
And you had to bother me.

14
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,729
I'm going to kill you.

15
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,902
<i>On an island like this,</i>
<i>nothing is strange anymore.</i>

16
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:13,406
Whether the Sennin live here or not,
that's not the crux of the matter.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,660
What's important is whether those who
live on this island are friend or foe.

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,454
That's all that matters.

19
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,225
-Wait!
-Huh? What is it?

20
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,570
<i>A child? Is it from the mainland?</i>

21
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,071
<i>Or is it…</i>

22
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,703
-Gabimaru!
-Who's that child?

23
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,957
What the hell is this
bonsai-creature anyway?

24
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,960
Is it a type of monster?

25
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,547
Gabimaru!

26
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,091
That girl knows something
about the island.

27
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,761
She may be our only clue!
I'm gonna catch her.

28
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,347
But… there's a monster ahead of you.

29
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,059
Huh?

30
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,228
I'll leave the rest to you!

31
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,313
You've gotta be kidding, right?!

32
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,232
Miss Sagiri!

33
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,734
I can't take my eyes off of Gabimaru.

34
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,278
Senta, good luck to you!

35
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,488
Uh…oh…

36
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,706
What the heck are you doing?

37
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,793
I don't want to reveal my strategies yet.

38
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:18,299
I want to test it out against someone

39
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,387
and see if my ninjutsu works
on these monsters.

40
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,440
You're familiar with this forest.

41
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,943
So we will need to talk.

42
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,906
Gabimaru!

43
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,662
What was that? That is not
the strength of a child.

44
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,330
Please wait!

45
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,416
We don't mean any harm.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,835
We just want to talk to you for a moment.

47
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:00,174
I'm glad… you understand what I'm saying.

48
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,186
<i>This power…</i>
<i>it's different from simple arm strength.</i>

49
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,565
<i>This is unnatural power.</i>

50
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,406
<i>Too many strange things have happened</i>
<i>since we arrived here.</i>

51
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,326
<i>This girl, the monsters, the statues,</i>

52
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,079
<i>and this village.</i>
<i>It was supposed to be a simple mission.</i>

53
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,081
<i>Get the elixir</i>

54
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,711
<i>and return to my wife as an innocent man.</i>

55
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,132
I don't know if you are human or not,
but you look like a girl.

56
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,593
I'd like to go easy on you but…

57
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,095
I'm at my wit's end.

58
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,099
I feel like I'm losing all emotions.

59
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,809
Gabimaru!

60
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,907
I’m fed up with all this exhausting work.

61
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,701
I just want to find the elixir.

62
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,579
Don't give me more trouble.

63
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,630
-She's crying…
-Of course she is.

64
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,591
-What should I do?
-First, put her down.

65
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,977
We caught her, so all is good.

66
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,481
But hey, looking at her, she's…

67
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,108
Just a normal child, isn't she?

68
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,735
Hey? What the heck is going on?

69
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,113
What is this family-like atmosphere?

70
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,157
I worked my ass off you know.

71
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,454
What shall we do now?

72
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,249
I want to ask her about the elixir.

73
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,126
We'll have to wait until she stops crying.

74
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,628
Who's good at comforting kids?

75
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,132
I beg you…

76
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,636
Did it just talk?

77
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,141
I beg you… please give me back that child.

78
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,185
In exchange, I'll lead you to the village.

79
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,521
I'll tell you about the elixir.

80
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,231
No, thank you.

81
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,485
You may be able to talk,
but you might be trying to trick us.

82
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,654
It's safer if we ask the girl.

83
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,989
She has a point.

84
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,783
We also have food in the village.

85
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,910
No, thank you.

86
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,912
We have baths as well.

87
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,916
Bath time! Fun time!

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,419
You think we can trust it?

89
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,463
We don't even know what it is.

90
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,424
At this point,
it doesn't matter what he is.

91
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,759
As long as we can find out
more about the elixir.

92
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,804
If he makes a suspicious move,
we'll take him down.

93
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,850
We're here.

94
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,813
It's more like a ghost town
than a village.

95
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,857
It's so foggy.

96
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,151
I don't see anybody else here.

97
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,738
It wasn't like this 1,000 years ago.

98
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,114
1,000 years ago?

99
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,700
I'll show you to my house.

100
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,833
What amazing ornaments.

101
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,712
They all look old.
Do you really live here?

102
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,964
I don't lie.

103
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,508
Let's get down to business…

104
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,927
Huh? You can do that later!

105
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,847
-Bath time first!
-We don't have time for that.

106
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,938
This is what I'm talking about.

107
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,525
This is great!

108
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,401
Do something about that woman.

109
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,862
She's impossible to handle.

110
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,619
<i>That girl is an obedient one.</i>

111
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:01,457
Take it easy.
It's better to relax when you can.

112
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,709
-You want to bathe togethe--?
-No.

113
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,297
He's so stubborn. Even you're
gonna take a bath, right, Sagirin?

114
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,259
Sagirin? I'm just here to watch over you.

115
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,594
It's uncomfortable if it's Senta, right?

116
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,847
We're just temporarily changing roles.

117
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,767
I haven't forgotten my original role…

118
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,814
at all.

119
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:31,028
<i>This bath is so relaxing,</i>
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

120
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,616
<i>We came here so brazenly and now</i>
<i>we're making ourselves at home like this.</i>

121
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,877
Are those towels? Thank you very much.

122
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,796
I think she likes you.

123
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,340
I wonder if she can't speak?

124
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,052
There's a well and a vessel.

125
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,683
Wait until we know it's true intentions.

126
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,311
You're right…

127
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,438
We have food as well.

128
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,236
Anyway,
let's ask him about the island right away

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,863
and then…

130
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,782
If you're that hungry, go ahead.
I warned you.

131
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,661
There's no poison inside.
The girl will eat this too.

132
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,289
What's your relationship with her?

133
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,416
I have no intention of telling you.

134
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,459
I see.

135
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,421
To be honest,
I'm only interested in the elixir.

136
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,632
It's about time you tell us about

137
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,344
this island
and the whereabouts of the elixir.

138
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,430
Wow, it's food!

139
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,307
Why are you already eating?!

140
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,725
I'm sorry…

141
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,686
I'm gonna have some too.
Let me have some now.

142
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,691
This is completely…

143
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,943
Throwing us off, isn't it?

144
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,779
You're not going to eat?

145
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,947
I didn't come here to eat.

146
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,577
<i>I don't know what humans call this place,</i>

147
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,330
<i>but we call it "Kotaku."</i>

148
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,583
<i>It is where the gods live,</i>
<i>also known as Shinsenkyo.</i>

149
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,754
It's quite different from what I imagined
of gods and Shinsenkyo.

150
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,007
I thought gods were
more spiritual creatures.

151
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,802
I've never left this island,

152
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,845
so I don't know about
those kind of things.

153
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,724
Is there really an elixir of immortality?

154
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,853
Of course there is.
The ancient legend says so.

155
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,234
<i>According to the legend,</i>
<i>the elixir is referred to as "tan."</i>

156
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,862
<i>it is the source of everlasting life.</i>

157
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,572
Tan?

158
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,366
Not the orange?

159
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,118
Where is it?

160
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,375
The island is made up of three regions.

161
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,503
The region which holds the forest
and the beach is Eishu.

162
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,090
This region here is called Hojo.

163
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,383
Tan is in the Horai region.

164
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,886
It is located at the center of the island,
beyond the fog.

165
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,348
This is very promising information!

166
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,392
Searching that forest was pointless!

167
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,686
And it has nothing to do with the orange!

168
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,521
<i>The elixir exists.</i>

169
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,107
<i>I can return to my wife.</i>

170
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,363
Have you seen it with your own eyes?

171
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,659
No… Do you have proof that
what you're saying is true?

172
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,163
You will meet them eventually.

173
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,791
Once you do, you won't doubt a thing.

174
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,170
<i>Once you meet Lord Tensen.</i>

175
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,392
<i>They are immortal and youthful.</i>

176
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,898
<i>They are forever beautiful,</i>
<i>perfect creatures.</i>

177
00:12:55,983 --> 00:13:00,196
<i>You likely have fought numerous Soshin</i>
<i>up until now.</i>

178
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,948
<i>But the Tensen are on a different level.</i>

179
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,243
<i>No one is a match for them.</i>

180
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:11,457
You're probably wondering
why I'm welcoming you into my home,

181
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,002
and telling you everything I know.

182
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,297
It's an act of pity.

183
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,259
Because that will be the last thing
you wish for.

184
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,262
<i>Every human who lands on this island</i>
<i>will eventually die.</i>

185
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,600
<i>Lord Tensen won't let anyone go.</i>

186
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,940
What do you mean by
"every human will die?"

187
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,400
So you're trying to trick us after all.

188
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,363
I am neither friend nor foe.

189
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,323
I'm just telling the truth.

190
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:48,077
Every human who enters the island
will be killed by Lord Tensen.

191
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,621
Who the hell is this Lord Tensen?

192
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,418
<i>He's the most powerful being</i>
<i>on this island.</i>

193
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,006
<i>They control the Soshin</i>
<i>and punish any sinners.</i>

194
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,844
<i>Especially those who intrude</i>
<i>on the island.</i>

195
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,013
<i>But no need to worry.</i>

196
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,768
<i>Humans that are punished not only die,</i>

197
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,563
<i>they transform into beautiful flowers.</i>

198
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:21,026
<i>They are released from sin and uncleanness</i>
<i>and they attain eternal bliss.</i>

199
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,755
<i>The life that becomes a flower</i>
<i>becomes the source of tan.</i>

200
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,133
That's just what the legend says, right?

201
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,552
There's no way I can believe that.

202
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,805
The elixir of immortality exists for sure.

203
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,183
I benefit from it as well.

204
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,686
He grew back!

205
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,148
You mentioned earlier that you've
existed for 1,000 years but…

206
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,401
Is she the same as you too?

207
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,447
Don't point your sword at people!

208
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,489
Huh?

209
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,783
Dang, she's so scary.

210
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,202
Oh… sorry about that.

211
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,916
Whether you believe or not,
this place is Shinsenkyo.

212
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,461
The consequences intruders pay
are god's will.

213
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,548
<i>Escaping the island is no easy task.</i>

214
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,223
Are you going to follow me to the bath?

215
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,893
Senta didn't take over for me.

216
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,229
I'm only going to wash my wounds
so I don't mind.

217
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,815
At least now
you're not slacking on the job.

218
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,983
I wasn't slacking.

219
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,152
<i>Yes, you were.</i>

220
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,488
<i>You were dozing off</i>
<i>after you got out of the bath.</i>

221
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,657
-No, I wasn't.
-Yes, you were.

222
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,241
<i>This guy's so persistent.</i>

223
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,869
The island is made up of three regions.

224
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,498
The elixir is in the center region,
the Horai.

225
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,417
The elixir is protected by Lord Tensen.

226
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,505
We have new intel but they are only
pieces of information.

227
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,258
Do you think we can trust
what he's saying?

228
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,055
My name is Hoko. The girl is Mei.

229
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,100
We were born and raised in this village

230
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,893
for several hundred years.

231
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:23,232
We just want to continue to live here
in peace. So don't get in our way.

232
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,693
I don't think he's lying but…

233
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,612
I can't believe every word he's saying.

234
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,489
Especially…

235
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,658
About Lord Tensen?

236
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:37,121
Lord Tensen is a Shenxian philosophy.

237
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,915
They refer to Sennin
of the highest ranking.

238
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,334
<i>The terms "Soshin" and "Horai"</i>

239
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,254
<i>are likely words of Taoist origin.</i>

240
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,841
We can solve that riddle later.

241
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,803
What matters is if they’ll be a problem
when obtaining the elixir.

242
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,805
I want to avoid unnecessary things…

243
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,437
as much as possible.

244
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,525
Oh… um…

245
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,696
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

246
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,199
Can't you see?
I'm going to wash my wounds.

247
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,785
Can't you see that she's taking a bath.

248
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,203
What's the big deal?

249
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,790
In the village, men and women,
young and old, bathed in the same bath.

250
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,835
Only the village chief had his own bath.

251
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,215
Is this the time
to worry about bath etiquette?

252
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,307
<i>Looking closely,</i>
<i>her hair and skin are a wreck.</i>

253
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,936
<i>Bathing supplies are available,</i>
<i>but not used.</i>

254
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>Does she not have a parental figure</i>
<i>who can teach her such things?</i>

255
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
I utilized the available bathing supplies

256
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,911
and recreated an Edo style bathhouse.

257
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,705
So that both parties can enjoy
the bathing experience,

258
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,416
I will be in charge here.

259
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,502
What is the meaning of this?

260
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,545
It's the least I can do to repay her.

261
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,173
I owe her for
a night's lodging and a meal.

262
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,304
Also, you are too tense.

263
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,057
You should rest when you can.

264
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,935
If you want to wash your body,
please use that.

265
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,565
My parents made me help out
with the bathing, so I'm quite good at it.

266
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,610
This a mixture of ashes
and oil cake of the camellia flower.

267
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,655
It's not much
but I brought this from the mainland.

268
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,198
I will wash your hair with this.

269
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,120
Look how clean you are.

270
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,456
I cannot remove your scars but…

271
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,625
don't you feel much better now?

272
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,258
What are you guys doing?

273
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>For God's sake, we have</i>
<i>a million things to think about…</i>

274
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,181
<i>And that girl…</i>

275
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,184
You're too tense, dear.

276
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,438
It's in the toughest situations

277
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,275
that we need to
take a good rest like this.

278
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,193
Is that so?

279
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,695
Yes, it is.

280
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,448
We're husband and wife.

281
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,993
There's no need to blush
each time I wash your back.

282
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,955
-Is that so?
-Yes, it is.

283
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm not blushing.

284
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,710
I just don't like baths that much.

285
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,463
I have a feeling that it'll wash away
all that I need to fight.

286
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,466
Wow!

287
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,386
Are you saying I'm washing away your luck?

288
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,763
That's not what I meant!

289
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,892
You are too tense, dear.

290
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,020
You should rest when you can,

291
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,648
or else you'll collapse
before a real battle.

292
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,358
A real battle?

293
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,570
Is there a big battle coming up?

294
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,282
No, it's a battle called life.

295
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,995
Be calm and just,

296
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,164
while standing by your beliefs.

297
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,376
At times you may push through,
and at times you may hide.

298
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,504
But you will never let go.

299
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,174
It's nothing compared to Kawanakajima.

300
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,429
Life is an extremely long battle.

301
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,683
You are the military general
and I'm the military commander.

302
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,436
Taking a good rest is strategic advice.

303
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,563
I got it.

304
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,025
Lastly, let's soak in the bath.

305
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,485
-No way!
-Huh?

306
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,737
I don't like soaking in the bath.

307
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,656
I'm clean already so there's no need to.

308
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,699
You're like a cat.

309
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,410
Starting from tomorrow,
it's just you and me.

310
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,871
We can no longer use my father's bath.

311
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,789
Fine!

312
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,171
As general, can I share with you
some strategic advice too?

313
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,799
Yes, please do.

314
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,094
Don't hide your scar with your hair.

315
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:06,014
You may have your reasons
but it doesn't bother me.

316
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,059
There's no need for you to hide it.

317
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,899
No, this is simply a hairstyle I like.

318
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,442
What? Really?

319
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,822
But if you say so…

320
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,367
I won't hide it anymore. Thank you.

321
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,289
Young lady…

322
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:35,043
if you're ashamed of your scars, don't be.

323
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,422
That's not easy for a woman.

324
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,424
That's not true.

325
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,343
I know a woman who has a big scar.

326
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,846
But she is
the most beautiful person I know.

327
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,850
Outer appearance is no big deal at all.

328
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,603
Why are you giving me that look?

329
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,024
What you said was so decent
that I was taken aback.

330
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,373
<i>He may not be a bad guy by nature.</i>

331
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,334
<i>A part of me feels that way.</i>

332
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,714
<i>Though little by little,</i>
<i>maybe he's starting to change.</i>

333
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,802
<i>I feel refreshed.</i>

334
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,141
<i>I can calmly recall now</i>

335
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,685
<i>what I need to prioritize.</i>

336
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,354
<i>There's no time to waste.</i>

337
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,107
<i>I can recall it all now.</i>

338
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,990
