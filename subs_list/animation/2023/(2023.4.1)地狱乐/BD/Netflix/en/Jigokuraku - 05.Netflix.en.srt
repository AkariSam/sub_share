1
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,677
<i>Father.</i>

2
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>Why… Why do you look at me like that?</i>

3
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,685
<i>Father!</i>

4
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,818
I see you woke up, Sagiri.

5
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,569
Sir Genji.

6
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,073
Where am I? Why am I here?

7
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,659
We're inside a cave in the island.

8
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,578
There is no sign
of monsters or insects around.

9
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,167
You were exposed to the toxic butterfly
scales and were knocked unconscious.

10
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,588
You'd better not move.

11
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,090
I refuse.

12
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,593
I can't let the sinner out of my sight.

13
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,721
You're awake.

14
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,849
Are you alright, Miss Sagiri?

15
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,353
Um… what are you doing?

16
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,981
I'm preparing food.

17
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,066
And I'm mending the torn clothes.

18
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,109
I'm supervising.

19
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,362
Didn't you say we didn't have time?

20
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,241
Yeah, well… I've been doing some thinking.

21
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,663
Now that Miss Sagiri is awake,

22
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,417
why don't we all sort out the information
about the current situation?

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,211
And eat what Mr. Gabimaru prepared for us.

24
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,005
Great idea!

25
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,507
Hey, these are starve pills!

26
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,594
I was expecting something better!

27
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,761
Starve pills?

28
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,306
I made them with
what I could find around here,

29
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,016
they turned out rather well.

30
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,934
Also,

31
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,979
I did some research on the island
while looking for ingredients.

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,899
Bottom line,

33
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,402
I couldn't find anything
that looked like this in the area.

34
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,447
Well, we don't even have
a full view of the island,

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,781
so I can't say for sure.

36
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,118
But even if you did, how would you know?

37
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,746
What do you know about the elixir?

38
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,836
No. I've never heard
of an elixir until now.

39
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,047
I was just looking for it
based on the picture.

40
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,930
<i>What I found while searching for</i>
<i>ingredients was about the native plants.</i>

41
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,349
<i>Most of them</i>
<i>were a mix of different plants,</i>

42
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,976
<i>but most of them were</i>
<i>common plants found on the mainland.</i>

43
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,812
<i>Well, there were a few</i>
<i>that were unfamiliar.</i>

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,691
The Ryukyu Kingdom is close by.
It might be a flower from there.

45
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,444
Oh, that's great.

46
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,238
What I found interesting was there were

47
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,949
some flowers
that looked like samurai in flower form.

48
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,450
No way.

49
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,662
<i>Where did the samurais who were sent to</i>
<i>this island disappear to?</i>

50
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,207
<i>If most of the plants on this island are</i>
<i>former humans,</i>

51
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,210
<i>I have a pretty good idea.</i>

52
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,172
What the hell are you giving us to eat!

53
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,216
I didn't use anything like that.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,470
Anyway,
I didn't see anything like this orange.

55
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:26,432
Maybe we shouldn't be too concerned
about the picture.

56
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,478
The words mentioned by the Government,
"Tokijiku no Kagunomi" and "Paradise"

57
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,106
are originally words
from different cultures.

58
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,694
<i>The stone statues scattered on the island</i>
<i>are close to Buddhism or Taoism.</i>

59
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,738
<i>It may be pointless to worry</i>
<i>about religious consistency.</i>

60
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,908
<i>What we should consider more</i>
<i>are the statues themselves.</i>

61
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,745
<i>Does the island have the technology</i>
<i>to make stone and clay statues?</i>

62
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,164
<i>If so, who made them?</i>

63
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,084
<i>Does that person live here</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

64
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,755
It's hard to believe
that people could live here.

65
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,759
The monsters and insects
are too dangerous for humans.

66
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,970
And the ecology and habits are a mystery.

67
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,263
When I cut one,

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,016
<i>I felt it's muscles</i>
<i>and skeletal structure,</i>

69
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,019
<i>but not the internal organs and, well…</i>

70
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,646
The genitals?

71
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,274
Yes. I didn't feel them.

72
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,359
So they don't have a penis?

73
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,738
<i>They look strange as well.</i>

74
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,531
<i>On top of a human body structure,</i>

75
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,284
<i>there's another completely different</i>
<i>creature on top of it.</i>

76
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,202
How can I say it…?

77
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,787
I understand.

78
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,249
The items that the creatures are wearing
are also very strange.

79
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,211
The items are religious,
but they lack detail.

80
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,671
In other words…

81
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,758
<i>they are half-baked gods.</i>

82
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,260
<i>Both the island and the monsters</i>
<i>are like that.</i>

83
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,637
<i>They are horrendous, yet silly.</i>

84
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,058
They are too unrealistic
to be a natural object.

85
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,686
Yet too artificial to be
a manifestation of mystery.

86
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,524
<i>It's like being thrown into</i>
<i>a mandala of bad taste.</i>

87
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,738
<i>It's impossible to understand and</i>
<i>I don't have a clue how to figure it out.</i>

88
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,747
A creature that lives
without internal organs

89
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,832
is itself a clue to immortality.

90
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,086
I'm beginning to see the possibility
that the elixir is on this island.

91
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,213
If it is, I can find it.

92
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,840
If I find it,
I can go home as a man free of sin.

93
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,886
Unless we're already dead somewhere

94
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,971
and this place is the real afterlife.

95
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,100
That's the last thing we need.

96
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,268
As Mr. Gabimaru said,

97
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,772
it would be better to investigate
the ecology of the monster first.

98
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,900
We need to know
where and how these monsters live.

99
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,485
It will be risky, but

100
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,530
the clue to the elixir is at hand.
That's all we need.

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,870
<i>Sunset… It hasn't even been a day</i>
<i>since we got to the island.</i>

102
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,626
Sir Genji.

103
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,255
Sagiri, return to the mainland by boat.

104
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,675
-Why?
-I will take your place.

105
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,136
The criminal I was in charge of is dead.

106
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,264
You are not only a samurai, you are
a daughter of the Yamada Clan.

107
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,642
A woman has a duty to marry
the next head of the family.

108
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,020
If I take your place, it shouldn't be
a problem with the superiors.

109
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,523
You will die as you are now.

110
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,443
Go home, Sagiri.

111
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,783
This is my duty.
It is the duty of a samurai to fulfill it.

112
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,412
I praise you for your auspicious mindset,
but look at the reality.

113
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,915
Do you have the strength to cut Gabimaru?

114
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,418
And that sword…

115
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,172
Where did you get that?
I'm sure you got it from somewhere.

116
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>The sword is the heart of a samurai.</i>

117
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,761
You have already lost
the heart of the Yamada Clan.

118
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,348
Well, in a battlefield, that's one thing.

119
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,059
But in combat, swords are disposable.

120
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,187
They are procured on the spot.

121
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,815
Indeed, your swordsmanship is excellent,

122
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,486
but only when you're testing swords
before an actual execution.

123
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,448
On the other hand,
what is required here is the art of war.

124
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,328
Superior swordsmanship doesn't go hand
in hand with superior fighting ability.

125
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,539
On this island,
you are clearly not strong enough.

126
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,292
That's the limit of a woman.

127
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,588
Can she return home that easily?

128
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,131
Senta.

129
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,093
This is an island where most of the
samurai who are dispatched never return.

130
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,431
<i>Even if you use a boat,</i>
<i>I'm not sure if you can escape.</i>

131
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,392
We need to get off the island!

132
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,810
We can't see in the fog, but

133
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,814
we must follow the Warrior Way
and move forward!

134
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,902
Why are samurai so stupid?

135
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,113
-What did you say?
-Read the currents.

136
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,951
If you act recklessly,
you'll only get wet and lose strength.

137
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,079
Samurai are so caught up
in what they don't have,

138
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,039
they don't know how to act wisely.

139
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,959
I see! I can learn a lot from you!

140
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,128
Is this the wisdom of the Mountain Clan?

141
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,715
My grandfather taught me
to avoid wasting anything.

142
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,969
Even if we were to return from the island,

143
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,096
without the elixir,
we'll be killed anyway.

144
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:20,101
I'll convince the superiors,
so don't worry!

145
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,061
Trust in me!

146
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,106
I'll get you home, Nurugai.

147
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,775
Of all the sinners
who participated in this,

148
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,611
you're the one who deserves to live
the most!

149
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,239
Oh, look!

150
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,367
It must be the Government's ship!
It's huge!

151
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,994
We can go home with this!

152
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,745
What the…

153
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,503
It's the Government's ship… No, it's not.
No way.

154
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,716
Are these all the ships
that tried to leave the island?

155
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,199
You!

156
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,827
-Don't pull out your sword, you idiot!
-Why?

157
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,253
Most animals are sensitive
to shiny things and hostility!

158
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,088
If only we had steered the boat back.

159
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,842
It's too late now!
I'm not smart like you, okay!

160
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,849
Let's find a boat we can use.

161
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,855
<i>Run Nurugai.</i>

162
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,609
If you die, the entire Mountain Clan
will be wiped out.

163
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,612
<i>We don't believe in things we can't see.</i>

164
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,114
<i>But I can't help thinking…</i>

165
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,492
<i>Is this punishment from God?</i>

166
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,872
Hey, if you're lost, I can take you
to the foot of the mountain.

167
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,124
Are you an Emishi?

168
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,627
If so, let me rest in your village.

169
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,254
What's Emishi?

170
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,132
<i>It is a term for those</i>

171
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,592
<i>who do not bow to the Government</i>

172
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,512
<i>and live in the mountains and fields</i>
<i>with their own culture.</i>

173
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,766
<i>In Lord Tokugawa's reign,</i>
<i>they are traitors.</i>

174
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,021
Take him away. Get him to tell us where
the other villages are, then execute him.

175
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,525
This will eradicate the Mountain Clan.

176
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:37,113
<i>I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry, Grandpa.</i>

177
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,990
<i>It's my fault.</i>
<i>It's because I brought the samurai here.</i>

178
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,784
<i>I…</i>

179
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,038
I am Asaemon.

180
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,374
I was employed by the Government,

181
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,294
but I cannot understand why
they would execute an innocent boy.

182
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,048
If there's a way for you to live,
then you should live.

183
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,802
<i>What should I do?</i>

184
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,556
<i>Should I live to keep the Clan alive?</i>

185
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>Or should I die to make up for</i>
<i>what I did to my people?</i>

186
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,311
<i>I…</i>

187
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,067
So then… And…

188
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,487
And I… La, la, la.

189
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,573
Sir Kisho! What happened to you?

190
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,576
It's me, Tenza! Do you understand?

191
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,078
Stop it. It's no use.

192
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,798
We're surrounded.

193
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,685
What are you doing, Nurugai?

194
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,939
If you want to escape, go alone.

195
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,193
I've had enough… I'm done.

196
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,571
What are you talking about?
I don't understand!

197
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,073
I've been thinking about it.

198
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,951
Whether I should live or die?

199
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,915
I finally understand.
This is punishment from god.

200
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:15,211
For killing my grandfather and everyone.

201
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,215
I don't understand at all!

202
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,342
So why do you have to die?

203
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,470
Samurais are idiots, right?!
So explain to me!

204
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,223
The Mountain Clan are supposed to live

205
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,226
for the people,
for the good of the village.

206
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,604
Only I survived.

207
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,190
And because of me, everyone died.

208
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,487
I don't get it at all! What do you mean?

209
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,738
Don't make it difficult.

210
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,241
What I'm saying is…

211
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,996
I told you to leave me alone!

212
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,251
If you don't explain,

213
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,755
if you don't convince me, I'm not leaving!

214
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,222
I'm getting close to my limit,
because I have no stamina!

215
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,933
So tell me!

216
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,226
Regardless of your grandpa and clan,

217
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,479
I want to know
whether you want to die or not!

218
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,110
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

219
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,863
I want to go back to the mountains.

220
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,742
Then there's only one thing to do.

221
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,120
Survive at all costs!

222
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,622
There's a boat over there we can use!

223
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,625
We'll break through here and get on that!

224
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,754
Got it!

225
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,229
You're strong, Nurugai.

226
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,647
Thank you.

227
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,150
Right back at you.

228
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,111
We got away for now, but…

229
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,280
we ended back where we started.

230
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,992
Yeah. I think all the currents around here
are made to

231
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,161
flow back to the island.

232
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,414
<i>If we don't find the ocean current</i>
<i>that goes outward,</i>

233
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,708
<i>we won't be able to return</i>
<i>even if we have the elixir.</i>

234
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,627
<i>And that monster…</i>

235
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,420
<i>it's a different species.</i>

236
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:26,050
<i>The stranded ships also seem</i>
<i>to be surrounding the island.</i>

237
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,427
<i>Those ships aren't just</i>
<i>from the last few years.</i>

238
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,681
Let's wash this blood off
and then think about it.

239
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,686
The ship that was floralized came back.

240
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,189
So there must be outward currents.

241
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,191
Maybe you're right.

242
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,860
Oh?

243
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,782
Nurugai… Your body shape is…

244
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,952
quite curvy for a boy.
Kind of like… a girl's.

245
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,080
Kind of like a girl? I am a girl.

246
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,666
No! What?! Are you serious?!

247
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,167
Why are you panicking?

248
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,336
Turn around! You're a girl!

249
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,589
Why do samurais fuss about trivial things?

250
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,716
This isn't trivial!

251
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,469
I beg you, please turn around.

252
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,721
I like your manliness.

253
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,556
When we get back safely, be my husband!

254
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,683
I can't think right now.

255
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,269
All I can think about now is the island
and stuff. I'm at my wits' end.

256
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,729
I'm an idiot after all.

257
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,233
Anyway,
let me summarize what we need to do.

258
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,321
First, let's go around the perimeter of
the island and find the outward currents.

259
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,199
That's a must for
finding a way out of the island.

260
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:36,370
And it's too dangerous for the two of us
to get past those monsters!

261
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,373
We'll need to find allies.

262
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,419
When the sun rises,
take the boat home, Sagiri.

263
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,880
This task is too much for a woman.

264
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,052
I agree with half of what Genji is saying.

265
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,889
If you can get out of here, you should.

266
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,434
But the other half of me wants you

267
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,396
to be here to hold Gabimaru down
in case something happens.

268
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,940
I see…

269
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,900
Well, it's just my gut feeling but…

270
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,905
<i>The impression I had when I first saw him</i>
<i>on the beach is different from now.</i>

271
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,492
<i>The other day it looked as if</i>
<i>he saved your life.</i>

272
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,247
It may be because you have to return
as a pair, but

273
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,876
you too have noticed his change,
haven't you?

274
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,258
Stay back!

275
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,511
If so, it would be

276
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,639
more reassuring if you were here.

277
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,266
That's my personal opinion.

278
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,269
I see…

279
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,281
Are you going to watch me
all night like that?

280
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,575
I'm not going to sleep.

281
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,911
I'm taking turns with the other Asaemon.

282
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,083
Then, what are the other groups
doing at night?

283
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,127
What a poorly thought-out strategy.

284
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,713
The samurai can only obey.

285
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,383
-So…
-Um…

286
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,554
Go ahead.

287
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,100
Are you feeling okay?

288
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,436
-What?
-What's with that look?

289
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,105
I'm just a bit surprised.

290
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,441
The poison from the insects spread quickly

291
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,069
because of the wounds I gave you, right?

292
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,321
That's why… I asked.

293
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,616
Didn't you say we didn't have time?

294
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,953
Yeah, well… I've been doing some thinking.

295
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,706
I also owe you.

296
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,419
Thanks to you, I've cooled down.
I've made up my mind.

297
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,381
It's too dangerous
to rush around in the dark,

298
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,135
and if the Iwagakure come ashore,
we can intercept them.

299
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,471
I've decided to live with my wife.

300
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,558
A long life with her.

301
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,936
I will not run away from those
who stand in the way of it.

302
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,021
I will meet them head on.

303
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,400
You are strong.

304
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,194
You're strong too. Even stronger than me.

305
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,323
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

306
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,326
I'm good at sensing that kind of thing.

307
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,121
Like a mind, body, spirit thing.

308
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,498
The heart just knows it.

309
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,334
I know that you were strong
in the prison house.

310
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,589
It's wasn't just an impression,
but a more concrete strength.

311
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,550
I wonder what that feeling was?

312
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,344
You look surprised.

313
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,721
Yes, I am.

314
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,348
I was told back in my hometown.

315
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,227
If you don't experience it yourself,
you won't know how strong you are.

316
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,859
You don't know yourself
as well as you think you do.

317
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,905
You don't know your true self
until you act.

318
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,162
In the end, nothing appeared.

319
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,748
I guess the monsters
don't come out at night.

320
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,709
Sagiri, are you ready to go home?

321
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,502
I'll take you to the ship.

322
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,963
Thank you for your concern.

323
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,965
But I'm not leaving.

324
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,761
Don't worry about not completing the job.

325
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,721
No, that's not it.

326
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,723
This is a matter of my way of life.

327
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,060
That's even more nonsense.
You are a woman.

328
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,480
You're way of life is to return and
give birth to a son for the Yamada Clan.

329
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,484
That's what I've been told all my life.

330
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,364
<i>The derisive eyes</i>
<i>that look at a woman wielding a sword.</i>

331
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,741
<i>People saying, "What are you doing?</i>
<i>You're a woman!"</i>

332
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,994
<i>Above all, the look of disappointment</i>

333
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,496
<i>in my father's eyes.</i>

334
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,999
A woman cannot carry on the Yamada family.

335
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:56,004
Take it easy and live as a woman.

336
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,049
<i>If you live as the daughter</i>
<i>of Asa the Decapitator,</i>

337
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,884
<i>you will be scorned by the outside world.</i>

338
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,636
<i>And if you live as a warrior</i>
<i>of the Yamada Clan,</i>

339
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,346
<i>you'll be shunned by your family.</i>

340
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,517
If I leave here, this will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

341
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,688
I don't understand.
Women have their roles.

342
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,231
It's only natural.

343
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,111
I can't stand the way you look at me.

344
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,862
What did you say?

345
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,242
Please look at me as a samurai.

346
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,743
You!

347
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,205
Please forgive my disrespectful behavior,

348
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,124
and my way of life.

349
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:38,255
I know I am weak and inexperienced.
It's just that…

350
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,258
I will not run away from those
who stand in the way of it.

351
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:45,262
I just want to at least decide for myself
how to live my life.

352
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:50,017
<i>I am sure that is true</i>
<i>for both men and women,</i>

353
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,768
<i>regardless of their position.</i>

354
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,521
<i>Isn't it a natural feeling</i>
<i>that all humans have?</i>

355
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,606
Please understand.

356
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,281
I can't bear to hear that.

357
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,034
That is not the way of a samurai.

358
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,120
This island is a battlefield.

359
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,289
Women and children don't belong here!

360
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,668
What?

361
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,170
How did you…?

362
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,673
In the battlefield,
swords are procured on the spot.

363
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,926
That's what you taught me last night.

364
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,721
You! A sword is the soul of a samurai!

365
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,681
How dare you take it from me!

366
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,184
Sir Genji…

367
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,656
