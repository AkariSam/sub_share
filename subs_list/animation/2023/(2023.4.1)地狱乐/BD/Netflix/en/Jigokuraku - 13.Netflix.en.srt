1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,174
Kill? Kill!

2
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,190
-Sh… Shion-<i>dono</i>!
-Nurugai!

3
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,901
Use your sword to cut deep
into the flowers and roots.

4
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,945
We might be able to
stop his transformation.

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,449
-Then take everyone and get out of here.
-Got it.

6
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,703
Shion-<i>dono</i>!

7
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,330
We'll talk later.
I'll finish this quickly!

8
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>The way the waves are moving…</i>

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,836
<i>The smell, the sounds…</i>
<i>There's no mistaking it.</i>

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>It's similar to what Tenza faced!</i>

11
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,676
<i>On the journey here, I studied</i>
<i>the life forces of the monsters…</i>

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>The quality of their waves</i>
<i>and how they use them.</i>

13
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,264
A magic for destroying their immortality…

14
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,850
I will test my idea on you.

15
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,771
<i>If I slash at your waves directly,</i>
<i>vital point or not, I may kill you.</i>

16
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,273
<i>Like cutting directly though the soul…</i>

17
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,358
<i>It will free the waves…</i>

18
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,779
<i>Work it into a circle…</i>
<i>And wrap myself up in it.</i>

19
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,094
The flower transformation stopped…
But at this point…

20
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,890
Hoko, what should we do?

21
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,225
There is nothing I can do.

22
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,354
I did not even know
Lord Tensen's true form.

23
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,608
Out of the way, you two.

24
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,862
It might be too late, but I have
a salve that can staunch the bleeding.

25
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,781
Yuzu… ri… ha…

26
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,284
I'm… already…

27
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,287
Shion-<i>dono</i>!

28
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,874
Don't worry about my master.
He's super-strong.

29
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,294
Besides, we were chasing someone
before we found you.

30
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,255
We can't die here.

31
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,592
<i>Tameshi Itto-ryu: Demon Rain.</i>

32
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,847
<i>Tameshi Itto-ryu: Long Autumn Rains.</i>

33
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,251
What the heck? That guy is amazing!

34
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,418
That's my master!

35
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,922
<i>It's not regenerating…</i>

36
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,925
<i>Is Shion-dono's Tao compatible</i>
<i>with the enemy's?</i>

37
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,343
At this rate…

38
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,931
<i>It's mostly as I expected.</i>

39
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,353
Awesome. You're a match for me too?

40
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,354
However…

41
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,612
Even a scratch from us
will start Florification!

42
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,865
You will become excellent Tan!

43
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,117
Master!

44
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,167
You too… wish to die?

45
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,673
I have no intention of dying here.

46
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,802
But if I must die to continue
on my path, then I don't mind!

47
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,595
What's with that guy?

48
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,139
He's terrifying!

49
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,682
He's going to die of blood loss…

50
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,475
Master…

51
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,688
Kill. Kill him!

52
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,607
<i>It's using the waves just as I thought,</i>

53
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,943
<i>but ordinary methods won't work.</i>

54
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,448
<i>I need a plan to take out this immortal…</i>
<i>But will my body hold up?</i>

55
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,199
We have to help…

56
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,827
Don't! You can hardly stand!

57
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,914
But… at this rate…

58
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,333
No. Shion-<i>dono</i> is already prepared to die.

59
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,836
He doesn't stand a chance fighting alone…

60
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,173
Let's at least make a second group
and make an opening for him.

61
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,716
Fine.

62
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,510
-Then let's all do it together.
-What?!

63
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,347
Give me a break! I'm
at the end of my strength!

64
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,849
I see…

65
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,606
-Is that better?
-Is what better?

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,566
That's weird…

67
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,237
Are you better now?

68
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,950
<i>A little bit of my strength came back…</i>

69
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,827
Are you better?

70
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,623
Um, well, yeah… But how?

71
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,627
My grandpa used to do this
all the time. I tried it on my master

72
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,629
and he said he felt better…

73
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,632
My strength feels very much recovered.

74
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,343
The waves are in all things,

75
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,179
but maybe they have
different compatibilities…

76
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,389
Like the five elements
of Chinese medicine.

77
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,142
But don't embrace someone so suddenly.

78
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,394
Its effects are strong enough
with just a touch.

79
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,646
Okay!

80
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,733
<i>Does that mean Tao can be compatible,</i>
<i>like one can raise the other's?</i>

81
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,153
<i>No… Now is not the time to think about it.</i>

82
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,406
<i>If I can move, then that's enough.</i>

83
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,159
-Let's go!
-Good luck!

84
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,916
Sagiri, Nurugai, didn't I tell you to run?

85
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,086
Wait… what happened to you?

86
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,921
We're reinforcements, Shion-<i>dono</i>.

87
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,215
I know its weakness.

88
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,174
Its weakness?

89
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,302
<i>The source of its power… It's the Tanden.</i>

90
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,805
<i>Hit its core, and it should die.</i>

91
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,352
But… This creature has two Tandens…

92
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,313
And more importantly, if it even
scratches you, it's fatal.

93
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,399
That's why we've done this.

94
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,319
<i>We've covered ourselves in bandages</i>
<i>and this mucus from Yuzuriha.</i>

95
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,865
<i>We should be able to avoid scratches</i>
<i>and thus Florification.</i>

96
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,075
Do you have to lick it?

97
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,326
Nope.

98
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,080
The child and I will team up
and take on the front.

99
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,332
While we do that, please take the back.

100
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,836
With the speed of your blade,
we can strike two places at once.

101
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,505
Watch out!

102
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,805
<i>That physical ability is impressive…</i>

103
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,770
Wow!

104
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,024
<i>Sagiri can also sense the waves…</i>

105
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,528
<i>Like me, she predicts the enemy's</i>
<i>movements from the flow of the waves.</i>

106
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,281
<i>With even more precision</i>
<i>and speed than me…</i>

107
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,825
<i>You've become stronger…</i>

108
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,828
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

109
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,788
Let's do your plan, Sagiri!

110
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,166
-Let us proceed with expediency!
-Alright!

111
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,503
<i>Tameshi Itto-ryu:</i>

112
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,588
<i>Autumn Shower!</i>

113
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,916
They're actually overpowering it! Wow…

114
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,297
<i>It's taking longer</i>
<i>and longer to regenerate.</i>

115
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,636
<i>I've never seen Shion-dono so fierce.</i>

116
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,639
<i>At this rate… we can win.</i>

117
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,185
<i>Keep up… the pace…</i>

118
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,523
<i>Even if I have to die here…</i>

119
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,036
<i>I'm sorry, Sagiri, Nurugai…</i>

120
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,789
<i>I knew it would put you in danger…</i>

121
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,750
<i>But there's no way to stop now!</i>

122
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>This murky sensation is covering my head…</i>

123
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,172
<i>My whole body.</i>

124
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,134
<i>This is a hatred I was not prepared for.</i>

125
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:57,430
<i>Hatred and frustration</i>
<i>are things I cannot allow.</i>

126
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,807
<i>I will never forgive myself</i>

127
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,184
<i>for that time I had no choice but to run.</i>

128
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,025
<i>I'll never forgive you! I'll never</i>
<i>forgive you! I'll never forgive you!</i>

129
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,529
<i>Yamada Asaemon Shion,</i>
<i>I will never forgive you!</i>

130
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,198
<i>Not until you end the life of your enemy.</i>

131
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,492
<i>Not until your own life ends!</i>

132
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,083
Shion-<i>dono</i>!

133
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,463
<i>Collect all of the waves</i>
<i>of your body in one place…</i>

134
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,051
<i>As if tempering it…</i>
<i>As if wearing it… On your blade…</i>

135
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,764
Collecting the waves
is like collecting your soul.

136
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,475
If you do it poorly, you may die.

137
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,019
Since you are immortal, I will teach you.

138
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,732
<i>The transience of life…</i>
<i>The heaviness of it…</i>

139
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,942
The terror of it!

140
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,236
<i>Wait…</i>

141
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,781
<i>Is this really its weakness?</i>

142
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,825
<i>Sagiri said it was</i>
<i>the source of its power…</i>

143
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,661
<i>But I don't feel any strong waves…</i>

144
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,167
<i>-No time to hesitate!</i>
-Shion!

145
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,293
It's the ovule!

146
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,461
Senta?!

147
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,758
The plant… monsters…

148
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,969
<i>Their Tanden is the ovule!</i>

149
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,723
<i>The place where…</i>
<i>the flower collects its nutrients…</i>

150
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,228
The center… of the flower petals…

151
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,147
That's where it's weakest!

152
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,204
So beautiful…

153
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,708
The shape of someone prepared for death…
The space between life and death…

154
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,128
We cannot reach it…

155
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,338
A perfect balance of Yin and Yang…

156
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,425
I want to tell Rien…

157
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,063
I've been waiting
a thousand years… Thank you…

158
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,011
Senta-<i>dono</i>!

159
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,223
He doesn't have much time left.

160
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,309
That took everything he had…

161
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,643
No!

162
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,271
-Senta!
-Master, don't move!

163
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,440
Where's that ointment?

164
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,108
I have enough for one more person…

165
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,026
Well then…

166
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,531
I think we should use it on him…

167
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,035
Can't we divide it?

168
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,078
I need some for myself too.

169
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,664
I'm not a nice enough person
to give it all away.

170
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,334
Besides, with what comes next,

171
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,045
we can't be carrying around
an injured person. Let it go.

172
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,964
No…

173
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,633
But… that's…

174
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,302
Didn't you say that
as long as we're alive,

175
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,262
we'll manage?

176
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,264
Ninjas are realistic.

177
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,266
We know the difference between

178
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,102
a challenge worth taking
and a challenge that isn't.

179
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,482
I think you already know…

180
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,734
you can't be saved.

181
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,153
So you don't need them.

182
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,156
Your role and your samurai pride…

183
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,492
You don't need them anymore.

184
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,202
Just… rest easy now.

185
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,790
You've lied to yourself
your whole life, right?

186
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,833
So why not,
at the very end, be true to you…

187
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,127
And think only about the things you love.

188
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,423
Your family… Your pet cat…

189
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,551
Someone you loved in your hometown?

190
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,345
Imagine what it's like
to be in that person's heart

191
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,682
so you can die in a beautiful place.

192
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,101
I'll lend you my arm, if you need it.

193
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,399
<i>Things I love…</i>
<i>My family back home… Sugar candy stars…</i>

194
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,360
<i>A book of Kitao Shigemasa's art…</i>

195
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,823
<i>In the heart of someone I admire…</i>

196
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,254
It seems the circumstances
have changed rapidly.

197
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,423
I'd like to regroup for a moment.

198
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:46,051
I agree. First, who the heck are you guys?

199
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,930
Let's get away from here first. Sagiri?

200
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,566
Thank you for earlier, Yuzuriha.

201
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,569
Once again, your composure saved the day.

202
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,659
Sinners and executioners
don't matter anymore.

203
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,037
If it did, we wouldn't survive.

204
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,039
We must…

205
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,082
focus on surviving and going home.

206
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,463
I won't let anyone else die.

207
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,549
We will all survive,
and we will all get off the island.

208
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,052
We will.

209
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,481
That's what you do as soon as you wake up?

210
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,733
What are you, a cat? You're too alert.

211
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,693
Where are we?

212
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,696
We're in a cave halfway up the mountain.

213
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,199
I carried you up here.

214
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,368
<i>I can't remember…</i>

215
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,063
I think we can hide here for a bit.

216
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,273
We'll still need to be
on alert, of course.

217
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,151
What are you doing?

218
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,653
I'm changing.

219
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,657
Sagirin, try this one on!

220
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,450
Me too!

221
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,244
Why would a boy wear this?

222
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,204
Y… you--

223
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,414
Settle down!

224
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,957
Sagiri…

225
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,625
I understand why you feel on edge,

226
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,836
but you all must be very tired.

227
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,006
No punishment will strike
if you let your guard down a bit.

228
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:47,923
Shion-<i>dono</i>…

229
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
-Yeah.
-Here, hold it for a sec.

230
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:50,926
Alright, everyone…

231
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,138
whatever you're doing,
just listen for moment.

232
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,180
Okay!

233
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,601
In order to survive, we need to
sort out the necessary information.

234
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,022
First of all, using
the waves against Lord Tensen.

235
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,441
What you call "Tao".

236
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,818
<i>Everyone naturally possesses the power,</i>

237
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,905
<i>but if you can manage to use it,</i>
<i>you can attain superhuman abilities.</i>

238
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,159
You've experienced it, Sagiri.

239
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,412
Your Tao has grown stronger
after everything you've experienced.

240
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,331
It must… have been hard.

241
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,084
Well… I'm sure it was for you too.

242
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,336
But it's dangerous to misuse it.

243
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,881
Tao is your actual life force.

244
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,717
If you use too much,
it won't just exhaust you.

245
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,803
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>the effects are exactly, but…</i>

246
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,890
<i>It could cause abnormalities</i>
<i>in your spirit or body…</i>

247
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,394
<i>Or your awareness… For example,</i>
<i>it could affect your memories.</i>

248
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,480
Or in the worst case, lead to death.

249
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,816
If you're going to go on
about life and death…

250
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,527
We have another serious problem.

251
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,654
The Elixir of Immortality.

252
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,281
They said they have something,

253
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,658
but it's not an elixir of immortality.

254
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,995
The government won't
accept that it doesn't exist.

255
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,790
Gabimaru said it existed…

256
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,459
<i>That his village chief was immortal.</i>

257
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,586
<i>It must exist somewhere…</i>

258
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,174
About that…

259
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,426
I think that might've been an illusion.

260
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,055
An… illusion?

261
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,933
Yeah, like the magic arts ninjas use.

262
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,061
They show little kids
supernatural displays

263
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,688
to install total domination over them.

264
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,943
<i>In the long run they instill the idea</i>
<i>that the chief can never be opposed.</i>

265
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,321
Only a few of the upper echelon
know the truth.

266
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,031
My village was the same way.

267
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,949
What?

268
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,744
There were some other things
that bothered me too.

269
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,329
Sagirin, you said

270
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,791
that Gabimaru is here for
the sake of the person he loves.

271
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,626
Yes, his wife…

272
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,838
That to me is kind of weird.

273
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,882
Ninjas are just tools. A woman
might get married at that age,

274
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,593
but would a man so young have a spouse?

275
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,387
<i>For example,</i>

276
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,056
<i>a person wouldn't be</i>
<i>reeled in with just fear, right?</i>

277
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,100
<i>If you want them to face death for you,</i>

278
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,185
<i>you have to give them</i>
<i>some other motivation.</i>

279
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,895
-I'm just guessing here.
-Ho…

280
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,397
-Hold on…
-Our villages.

281
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,065
They're different, of course.

282
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,900
<i>But… You know…</i>

283
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,110
<i>I can't remember.</i>

284
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,404
<i>Has something blocked my memories?</i>

285
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,657
<i>Gabimaru's… wife?</i>

286
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,910
<i>Does she actually exist?</i>

287
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,912
Hold on…

288
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,913
<i>What's her name?</i>

289
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,416
<i>-Have you seen her?</i>
-Please…

290
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,836
<i>Couldn't it be</i>
<i>some kind of long-term magic?</i>

291
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,840
<i>I mean… Can he even</i>
<i>tell you what she looks like?</i>

292
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,467
<i>I can't…</i>

293
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,804
<i>Where even am I? Why am I here?</i>

294
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,681
<i>Who are these people?</i>

295
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>Enemies…? I don't think so…</i>

296
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,186
<i>I know who I am.</i>

297
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,729
<i>I am</i>

298
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,233
<i>Chief of the Iwagakure People,</i>
<i>Gabimaru the Hollow.</i>

299
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,571
<i>I'll have to start by talking to</i>
<i>these people and collecting information.</i>

300
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,240
<i>If my secrets get out…</i>

301
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,496
Gabimaru… are you okay?

302
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,249
Yeah. I'm fine.

303
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,096
Aren't you going to sleep, Sagiri?

304
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,308
Shion…<i>dono</i>?

305
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,686
What are you wearing?

306
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,730
I changed, since I was covered in blood.

307
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,857
It wasn't a very good "look".

308
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,987
I thought I finally found
someone who understood my jokes.

309
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,114
Maybe my delivery was bad…

310
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,325
No, it was exactly as it should be.

311
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,703
It's just… Right now, I just…

312
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,751
<i>Eizen-dono, Genji-dono,</i>
<i>Senta-dono, Kisho-dono,</i>

313
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,380
<i>even Tenza-dono… So much has happened…</i>

314
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,258
but it's only the third night…

315
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,720
And Gabimaru… I have no idea
what happened to him.

316
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,139
Sagiri…

317
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,475
-Are you in love--
-No, not at all.

318
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,019
You shouldn't see
everything as a love affair.

319
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,937
Sorry.

320
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,023
But it's clear you feel
some way about him.

321
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,775
Enough to change your point of view.

322
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,696
What is Gabimaru to you?

323
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,951
Honestly… I don't really know. But…

324
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,495
<i>To be born in a village of murderers,</i>

325
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,123
<i>continuously ordered to kill…</i>

326
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,541
<i>Even if you know love,</i>

327
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,710
<i>it's just torture for your past self.</i>

328
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,505
And on top of that,
if, like Yuzuriha said,

329
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,091
even your motive ends up a deception…

330
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,594
That's just… That's just so sad…

331
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,015
He is a vicious murderer.

332
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,393
He is, but… I don't think
he's a bad person.

333
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,853
That's why…

334
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,690
I believe they will reunite.

335
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,193
He would never give up.

336
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,529
<i>He would survive, and make it back.</i>

337
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,220
HOTEL OHASHI

338
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,473
I will now read a message from the Shogun.

339
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,766
Listen carefully.

340
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,937
I hereby order the House of Yamada
to depart again for Shinsenkyo

341
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,731
and monitor those who
have alighted on the island.

342
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,484
I have selected a suitable leader.

343
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,070
Yamada Asaemon Shugen.

344
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,990
