1
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,433
<i>Beheading requires</i>

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>an extremely high level of skill.</i>

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,688
<i>With its strong bones</i>

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,441
<i>and more than a dozen overlapping muscles,</i>

5
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>the neck cannot be easily severed.</i>

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,527
PURSUE LOYALTY

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,903
Any last words?

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,405
No.

9
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>Cutting a man with a single blow</i>
<i>is a difficult task.</i>

10
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,413
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>it requires repeated hits.</i>

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,666
<i>The execution ground is</i>
<i>always a bloodbath.</i>

12
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,268
That's impossible.

13
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,605
<i>Why… Why can't I die?</i>

14
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,483
<i>Or rather, why won't I die?</i>

15
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,862
<i>I have no reason to live.</i>

16
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,619
<i>Until now, I've killed so many people.</i>

17
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,414
<i>I have no desire to live a long life.</i>

18
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,387
Your name is Gabimaru.

19
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,849
You were born as a ninja
in the Village of Iwagakure.

20
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,894
From an early age,
you were trained to only kill.

21
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,064
Many lose their lives during training,

22
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,609
but instead you attained
superhuman strength.

23
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,486
I see.

24
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,989
If you're from Iwagakure,

25
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,117
then breaking a blade with your hands
must be easy.

26
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,119
I guess so.

27
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,373
That executioner was so lousy,
I didn't even need to use ninja art.

28
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,001
Can you use ninja art?

29
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,379
-Can you show me?
-Why should I?

30
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,131
I'm just curious.

31
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,382
No, then.

32
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,384
Burn him at the stake!

33
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,470
<i>Burning at the stake</i>

34
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,306
<i>was a form of punishment for arsonists.</i>

35
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,267
<i>The skin is burned, causing extreme pain.</i>

36
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,688
<i>The heat contracts the muscle, causing it</i>
<i>to flex to the point of breaking bones.</i>

37
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,401
<i>Eventually, the smoke from the flames</i>
<i>causes suffocation.</i>

38
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,570
<i>Or you die from poisoning.</i>

39
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,822
<i>It's a very excruciating punishment.</i>

40
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,702
<i>Sometimes they were killed first</i>
<i>as a gesture of mercy.</i>

41
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,041
Sorry about that.

42
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,353
<i>He's not dying, even with all this fire.</i>

43
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,442
Not that I'm trying to resist or anything.

44
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,320
I'd rather you kill me.

45
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,571
Is that so?

46
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,033
If your back is to me, why don't you
hand me some clothes?

47
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,035
Hey! You hear me?

48
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,997
My job is to take your statement.

49
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,083
It's going fine so far. Please continue.

50
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,337
There's nothing interesting
about my upbringing.

51
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,256
I'm just doing my job.

52
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,012
<i>My parents? I have no idea.</i>

53
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,016
<i>I know that when I was a baby,</i>
<i>they were killed by the village chief.</i>

54
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,018
<i>I don't know the reason.</i>

55
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,103
<i>I don't think anything of it.</i>

56
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,522
<i>A dream?</i>

57
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,274
<i>Don't have one.</i>

58
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,235
<i>We shinobi have no reason or ambition.</i>

59
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,155
<i>We just kill as we are told.</i>

60
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:28,036
Why was I captured? Um, well…

61
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,080
I was trying to leave the village.

62
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,166
During a mission
I was betrayed by a fellow ninja

63
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,417
and I was captured.

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,919
It was probably
the village chief's command.

65
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,922
It's the law that
no one is allowed to escape.

66
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,382
It can't be helped.

67
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,760
So then,

68
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,137
why did you try to leave
in the first place?

69
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,681
Let the bull execution begin!

70
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,391
<i>The bull execution is</i>

71
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,686
<i>a punishment in which the bull is forced</i>
<i>to pull a rope tied to a man's leg.</i>

72
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,563
<i>It's said that a human leg</i>

73
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,649
<i>can withstand a force of 500 kilograms.</i>

74
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,693
<i>A bull's strength is 950 kilograms.</i>

75
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,571
<i>It's capable of ripping not only the legs,</i>

76
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,699
<i>but it can rip the body</i>
<i>from the groin, up to the chest.</i>

77
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,096
Um…

78
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,643
This is a disgrace to
the magistrate's office.

79
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,144
Bring more bulls!

80
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,855
That's strange.

81
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,525
A shinobi's body?

82
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:44,529
No. You say that you want to be killed,

83
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,739
yet it looked like you were resisting.

84
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,867
Why would someone
who has no will to live…?

85
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,577
Tell me,

86
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,164
what was the reason you wanted to leave
the village in the first place.

87
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,709
Can you answer my question from yesterday?

88
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,047
-Forget taking his statement, just--
-I'm on the job.

89
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,299
-How about the bulls?
-I'm on the job.

90
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,677
-It's not--
-I'm on the--

91
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,178
It's not much of a reason.

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,932
I was the head assassin of the Iwagakure.

93
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,853
I was recognized
by the chief of the village

94
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,647
and was to marry the chief's daughter.

95
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,774
<i>However…</i>

96
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,903
<i>the chief's daughter was a fool.</i>
<i>As a ninja's daughter,</i>

97
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,490
<i>a chief's daughter, I have no idea</i>
<i>how you would turn out like that.</i>

98
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,078
<i>An innocent and naïve girl,</i>
<i>who was sheltered her whole life.</i>

99
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,206
<i>Because of her, my entire life changed.</i>

100
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,085
You need to remove your sandals
before coming inside.

101
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,338
Once a day, let's put our hands
together and pray to the gods.

102
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,592
Let's always say
a word of thanks before a meal.

103
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,595
We give thanks for the life we receive.

104
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,015
I was very confused and fed up.

105
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,349
I thought I'd lose my touch.

106
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,104
If that's the case, it can't be helped.

107
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,773
But I have one last mission for you to do

108
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,360
in exchange for leaving the village.

109
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,950
<i>I realized I was being set up.</i>

110
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>But even if I escaped, I knew that</i>
<i>the Iwagakure would come after me.</i>

111
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,125
<i>It was a dead end,</i>
<i>the moment I was caught.</i>

112
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,254
<i>It was foolish of me</i>
<i>to defy the chief in the first place.</i>

113
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,881
<i>And so I gave up.</i>

114
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,385
It's not much of a reason, is it?

115
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,268
This may be none of my business but…

116
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,688
It's better for a woman not to get
involved with him too much.

117
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,900
Do you know his name?

118
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,487
Isn't he Gabimaru?

119
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,155
The ex-shinobi from Iwagakure?

120
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,158
No, I'm talking about his other name.

121
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,164
<i>Gabimaru the Hollow.</i>

122
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,750
<i>No blood or tears.</i>
<i>His emotions are hollow.</i>

123
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:09,048
<i>He's a monster who killed 20 men</i>
<i>as he was being captured.</i>

124
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,843
Rumor has it that
all the shinobi of the Iwagakure

125
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,263
have taken an elixir and are immortal.

126
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,183
It's an elixir of immortality
which can be found in Shinsenkyo.

127
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,060
The elixir of life?

128
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,564
I'm sorry. I may have spoken too much.

129
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,692
Anyway, he's dangerous.

130
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,360
Do you really think so?

131
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,322
It's just that… Why would a hollow man

132
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,199
resist so much

133
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,118
that he had to kill 20 people?

134
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,081
<i>You say you want to be killed,</i>

135
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,667
<i>yet it looked like you were resisting.</i>

136
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,336
<i>What am…</i>

137
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,213
<i>What am I doing?</i>

138
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>Why don't I just die?</i>

139
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,595
<i>I have no reason to live, right?</i>

140
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,471
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

141
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,724
<i>I'll end it all tomorrow.</i>

142
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,934
<i>At tomorrow's execution.</i>

143
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,902
<i>The boiling kettle punishment,</i>
<i>also called "the boiling oil punishment"</i>

144
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,904
<i>involves the use</i>
<i>of large quantities of oil.</i>

145
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,201
<i>However, oil ignites</i>

146
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,413
<i>at a temperature higher than</i>
<i>370 degrees Celsius.</i>

147
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,415
<i>Therefore the oil would not last long</i>

148
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,417
<i>in the earthen kettles in the Edo period.</i>

149
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,002
No!

150
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,630
<i>Why won't I die?</i>

151
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,382
<i>Why do I still endure?</i>

152
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,344
<i>I have no regrets, right?</i>

153
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,013
<i>You're hollow, remember!</i>

154
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,264
Why?!

155
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,016
Why don't you die?!

156
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,942
Sir, everything is ready.

157
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,944
I can begin when you're ready.

158
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,120
What punishment will I get today?

159
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,040
Honestly, I'm fed up with you guys.

160
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,000
When are you going to…

161
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,213
That's the last of your small talk.

162
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,224
What is this place?

163
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:28,312
She's not just a watchman.

164
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,233
She has come all the way from Edo.

165
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,446
She is a beheading executioner,

166
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,740
her name is Yamada Asaemon Sagiri.

167
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,754
<i>Yamada Asaemon are</i> ronin,
<i>who have served as</i>

168
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:59,301
<i>sword testers</i>
<i>and executioners for generations.</i>

169
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,345
<i>They belong to the Yamada Clan.</i>

170
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,265
<i>They are also masters of swordsmanship.</i>

171
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,851
<i>They carry out beheadings</i>
<i>with a single stroke.</i>

172
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,770
Asaemon? A female executioner?

173
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,772
Yes, a female executioner.

174
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,358
The rogue ninja, Gabimaru.

175
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,611
The government has ordered your execution.

176
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,781
You said you wanted to be killed,
didn't you?

177
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,784
I will grant your wish.

178
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,420
<i>This woman… She's the real deal.</i>

179
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,676
Miss. Sagiri! Hurry and kill him!

180
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,178
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,812
Why do you run?

182
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,815
You could've died if you hadn't moved.

183
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,320
<i>I could've died… Really?</i>

184
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,161
<i>Do I not want to die?</i>

185
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,999
In the course of my work,

186
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,085
I have witnessed
the final moments of many people.

187
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,963
And I've come to recognize
their true feelings.

188
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,092
The sword reflects a person's true nature.

189
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,013
Those who put on a tough act
until the moment of their death,

190
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,433
those who desperately beg for mercy
in the last moment,

191
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,768
and…

192
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,147
those who pretend that
they have accepted death.

193
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>What…?</i>

194
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,526
Gabimaru the Hollow.

195
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,112
I see that you have a great emptiness.

196
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,741
I thought I would understand it
if you told me of your upbringing.

197
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,954
But, you are lying about one thing.

198
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,289
You are clinging on to life.

199
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,417
It's because you love your wife.

200
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,548
Wasn't her existence…

201
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,134
<i>the very meaning of life for you?</i>

202
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,056
Let's put our hands
together and pray to the gods.

203
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,308
<i>Let's say a word of thanks.</i>

204
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,812
<i>Let's not forget the ordinary.</i>

205
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,398
<i>Let's be a good couple.</i>

206
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,567
<i>You are…</i>

207
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,325
I was right, wasn't I?

208
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,620
Why do you lie to yourself?

209
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,831
You couldn't die during the executions

210
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,125
because you cared for her.

211
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,627
You're just telling yourself that

212
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,256
you have no reason to live.

213
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,257
Shut up!

214
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,176
I have no reason!

215
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,429
What the hell do you know?!

216
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,931
What do you know about the life I lived?

217
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,643
I am… hollow!

218
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,521
You are not hollow.

219
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,607
You're wrong.

220
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,525
It's the perfect name for me.

221
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,153
I'm used to seeing these dirty hands.

222
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,655
These are the only hands

223
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,074
I can show you or anyone.

224
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,581
That's not true.

225
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,834
You have a kind heart.

226
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,337
You're the only one

227
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,255
who didn't reject my face.

228
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,345
Maybe it's not bad
getting used to ugly things, after all.

229
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,849
In the Iwagakure, men are soldiers.

230
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,310
Women are vessels for their children.

231
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,730
We cannot choose how we want to live.

232
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,441
<i>So is my face.</i>

233
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,447
<i>My father burned my face</i>
<i>so that I'd give up</i>

234
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,823
<i>the life of a normal woman.</i>

235
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,617
But…

236
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,620
the heart doesn't die so easily.

237
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,957
But…

238
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,218
What the hell?!

239
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,638
See, look at how red your face is.

240
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,808
How can someone like that be hollow?

241
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,018
I am…

242
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,771
Gabimaru the Hollow!

243
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,941
I am a heartless monster!

244
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,570
Just because you try to change,
it's not that easy!

245
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,626
<i>I'm going to stop</i>
<i>earning money by killing.</i>

246
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,461
<i>Just her and I…</i>

247
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,714
<i>we will live together in peace.</i>

248
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,091
<i>I'm sure the chief will understand.</i>

249
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,846
<i>No more killing.</i>

250
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,724
<i>Let's live in a quiet place,</i>

251
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,727
<i>just the two of us.</i>

252
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,482
<i>Such a dream,</i>

253
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,403
is never going to happen anyway!

254
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,696
It will!

255
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,909
What?

256
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,869
LETTER OF OFFICIAL RELEASE

257
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,621
This is a letter of official release
issued by the government.

258
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,166
It's a letter that exonerates a person
of any crime,

259
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,377
and promises
the Military leader's blessing.

260
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:26,920
As long as you have this…

261
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,631
neither the magistrate's office
nor the village ninja

262
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,550
will be able to lay a finger on you.

263
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,430
-What are you saying?
-But, there's one condition.

264
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,557
You must go to the other world.

265
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,771
The other world? You mean the other shore?

266
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,148
-Yes.
-Are you telling me to die?

267
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,691
No.

268
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,569
<i>Shinsenkyo is a land with no suffering,</i>

269
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,989
<i>but filled with abundance and joy.</i>

270
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,241
<i>It has been believed since ancient times,</i>

271
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,494
<i>and has been called Paradise,</i>
<i>the other shore,</i>

272
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,704
<i>and the land of everlasting life.</i>

273
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,499
<i>It was believed to be located</i>

274
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,794
<i>in the southwestern sea,</i>
<i>further than the Ryukyu Kingdom.</i>

275
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,546
<i>And it has finally been found.</i>

276
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,384
<i>Butterflies and flowers dance,</i>

277
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,346
<i>and somewhere</i>
<i>a beautiful song can be heard.</i>

278
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,808
<i>The legend was true.</i>

279
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,476
DESCRIPTION OF PARADISE

280
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,936
<i>It is said that in Shinsenkyo,</i>

281
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,730
<i>there is an elixir of immortality.</i>

282
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,067
<i>The nobles sent</i>
<i>a survey team to the island</i>

283
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,236
<i>in search of the elixir.</i>

284
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,238
<i>But…</i>

285
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,434
<i>After that they were dispatched</i>
<i>a total of five times,</i>

286
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,229
<i>but no one returned.</i>

287
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,527
<i>Except for their remains.</i>

288
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,864
Wait a minute.

289
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,825
What kind of story is that? A fairy tale?

290
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,034
Yes.

291
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,829
That is what everyone thought.

292
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,081
Until they actually saw it.

293
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,211
How mysterious… that a man
can turn into a flower.

294
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,589
How mystical.

295
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,508
The island was real after all.

296
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,219
There must be an elixir of immortality.

297
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,472
Next time, use someone
who you don't mind killing.

298
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,184
Gather criminals who are on death row

299
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,060
and send them to the island.

300
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,981
The one who brings back the elixir
will be exonerated from his sins!

301
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,736
I came here
to find the right person for the job.

302
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,573
Someone with the ability
and above all, the will to live.

303
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,202
When I arrived here, I was told that

304
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,747
your wife was still
in the Iwagakure village.

305
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,168
<i>Since the day you were taken captive,</i>
<i>she has shut everyone out,</i>

306
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,171
<i>and has not spoken a word to anyone.</i>

307
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,300
<i>I'm sure that</i>
<i>she believes you will come back.</i>

308
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,056
I'm going to ask you once more.
Do you have a reason to live?

309
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,518
Going to an unknown island
with deadly criminals,

310
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,312
and fighting them for a full pardon.

311
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,442
That is the one and only way
you can see her again.

312
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,818
Do you still…

313
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,364
want to be with her again?

314
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,324
Gabimaru the Hollow.

315
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,202
That's bullshit!

316
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,455
I won't let you get out of here so easily.

317
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,960
This is a message from the government.

318
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,962
He's a criminal on death row!

319
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,713
Anyone can take his place.

320
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,092
If you get in my way,
I'll take you both down.

321
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,763
Are you listening, Hollow?!

322
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,349
<i>Heartless and hollow…</i>

323
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,852
<i>The heart doesn't die so easily.</i>

324
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,281
You wanted to see some ninja arts, right?

325
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,584
If this is what you want…

326
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,422
Behold, the ninja art "Fire Monk."

327
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,438
Well done.

328
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,654
I'll do it. I'll find it.

329
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,281
The elixir of immortality.

330
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,328
So, what do I do now?

331
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,039
Follow me.

332
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,623
First, we will go to Edo.

333
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,294
What? Why don't we just go
directly to the island?

334
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,546
It'll take longer to get there.
What a pain.

335
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,548
<i>The minute he moves on,</i>
<i>he starts complaining.</i>

336
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,342
If you don't want to, forget it.

337
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,928
I'll do it!

338
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,097
I'll do whatever it takes.

339
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,476
I don't care if I have to fight criminals
or go to an unknown island.

340
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,479
I'll make it back alive!

341
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,566
For you!

342
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,948
