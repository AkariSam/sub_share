1
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,427
I thought a pile of dirty rags was moving,

2
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,679
but it's just that ninja from before.

3
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,433
You look like hell. Someone do you in?

4
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:52,028
Woah! I want to
exchange blows in that state…

5
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,031
You're really exceptional, aren't you?

6
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,659
<i>It'll be a challenge to take him out</i>
<i>without hurting myself.</i>

7
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:02,539
Your exhaustion is worse than you realize.
Your defenses are slow.

8
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,833
Speak for yourself,
your center of gravity is off.

9
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,503
You're not used to injuries…
I can tell by the way you stand.

10
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,258
Your left arm is injured,
and you can't use it, right?

11
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,773
Okay, that's enough.

12
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,943
Please stop your useless posturing.

13
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,655
It's not useless! A fight begins
by predicting the opponent's movements.

14
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,156
It is useless.

15
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,910
It's unscientific and unnecessary
in the moment. It's pointless.

16
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,039
What we should be doing now
is collecting information.

17
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:49,794
We must ask him about his experiences so
far, where his designated Asaemon is, and…

18
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,131
who that girl is behind him.

19
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,925
Fighting won't yield
any useful information.

20
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,552
So…

21
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,806
We must steal it without killing him.

22
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,808
Or something like that.

23
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,437
I do know how to keep someone from dying.

24
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,815
Oh? Do you intend to fight?

25
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,525
It will be against the two of us.

26
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,278
<i>Now's the time to move… But…</i>

27
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>These two are strong. Undeniably strong.</i>

28
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,329
<i>What I've been doing isn't going to work.</i>

29
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,377
<i>Because I'm not Gabimaru</i>
<i>the Hollow anymore.</i>

30
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,755
What are you doing?

31
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,466
Your strength is promising,
so I have a proposal.

32
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,843
Why don't we work together?

33
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,688
You didn't move.

34
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,066
It would seem that you
don't intend to deceive us.

35
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,443
But I'm disappointed.

36
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,488
I am looking for strong fighters.

37
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,449
Not cowards who readily lower
their heads to their enemies.

38
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,077
Your thinking is too simplistic.

39
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,456
I want to hear why
he would go to these lengths.

40
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,838
A monster named "Lord Tensen"?!

41
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,051
-I never saw anything so strong! Why not?!
-No idea.

42
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:24,055
More importantly… Regenerative abilities?
Not dying after breaking its neck?

43
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,308
-What about its organs? Did you see?
-Seriously, no idea.

44
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,519
I don't know much.

45
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,480
I only want to be pardoned
and go back to someone.

46
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,691
I won't be picky about how I do that.

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,193
Please lend me your strength.

48
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,322
But… There's no proof that
what you're saying is true.

49
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,032
Okay! I'm in!

50
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,495
If I can see both Tensen and Horai,
that's killing two birds with one stone.

51
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,706
We were completely lost anyway, right?

52
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,084
Yes, but… He's a competitor…

53
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,588
That's fine. Especially since
being pardoned isn't actually my goal.

54
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,844
-Didn't you want to sharpen your skills?
-That's a means to an end.

55
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,848
I want immortality.

56
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,102
You mean you're going to
use the elixir on yourself?

57
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:17,400
Of course not!
Immortality in itself sounds boring.

58
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,610
I strive to achieve fame and greatness!

59
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,115
Then my name will be spoken of across
the world, and I will become legend.

60
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,120
The name Gamiya Gantestusai
will never age and never die!

61
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:33,207
Who I am now, how I look, my words…

62
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,043
Maintained in pictures and stories,

63
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,628
to be passed down
for future lost generations.

64
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,007
This is true immortality!

65
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,761
Really… You're the one who's lost.

66
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,763
Whatever. I'm serious.

67
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,516
So? What are you going to do,
Whatever-your-name-is?

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,353
-I've made up my mind.
-It's Asaemon.

69
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,273
I'm not interested in
exaggerated romantic notions.

70
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,277
I am very intrigued by
the biology of immortal beings.

71
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,282
Allow me to eliminate this Tensen person.

72
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,910
When you kill him,
please let me dissect him!

73
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,288
We're united.

74
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,167
Well then, please share
any other information.

75
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,711
Yeah. Starting with this girl.

76
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,134
-Why are you surprised?
-Ah, well…

77
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,430
She was a little girl just
a minute ago, but she grew up.

78
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,518
Who cares about that? It's just one
of the mysteries of women.

79
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,936
That's not the problem.

80
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,816
Ga… Ga… bi… maru.

81
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,193
You can talk now?

82
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,279
What are you?

83
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,908
No… More importantly,
tell me about the elixir!

84
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,537
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,294
Thank you for saving me.

86
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,548
If you can talk, please tell me.

87
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,091
<i>Your strange power…</i>

88
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,344
Are you like Lord Tensen?

89
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,225
No matter how
you look at it, it's strange.

90
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,977
Senta-dono?

91
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,774
You said that Lord Tensen is a god
that sorts people's souls in Horai.

92
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,692
Yes.

93
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,737
After everything I've heard,
I've come to a conclusion.

94
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,992
It is actually impossible
for this to be the "real Shinsenkyo."

95
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,537
This is clearly a religion
designed by humans.

96
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,624
-What do you mean?
-Horai, Eishu, sitting in prayer.

97
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,793
And the name "Lord Tensen."

98
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,754
These are all originally words
used in other religions.

99
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,800
It's a mysterious island.
Who cares if its religion is a jumble?

100
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,261
Therein lies the problem!

101
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,389
Each of the elements mixed in
are one-sided interpretations

102
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,766
from specific cultural spheres.

103
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,397
<i>-Now I've done it…</i>
-It means that human religions came first.

104
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,150
<i>The way they're mixed is haphazard, too.</i>

105
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,488
<i>Specific eras and cultures have been</i>
<i>mixed only on a superficial level.</i>

106
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,449
This crookedness… It feels familiar!

107
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,243
-What? What is it?
-Moro Makiya!

108
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>He founded a religious sect</i>
<i>scheming to overthrow the shogun.</i>

109
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,875
<i>His religion was very similar to this one.</i>

110
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,253
<i>It was cobbled together from various</i>
<i>religions with the same crookedness.</i>

111
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,674
The defective feeling I had about
this place was because of that.

112
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:33,262
Not just the religion, but the monsters
and the structure of the island…

113
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,557
<i>It was all created by someone.</i>

114
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,770
<i>I'm guessing here, but it wasn't</i>
<i>just that no one returned from the island…</i>

115
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,814
<i>It was also that only those</i>
<i>turned into flowers returned.</i>

116
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,275
<i>Everything was by design from the start.</i>

117
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,403
But! No… Because of that!

118
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,783
If this is all by somebody's design, that
means it could also be our first clue!

119
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,787
It also means we should be able
to find the elixir and a way out!

120
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,084
I'm sorry for blabbering on!

121
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,421
-No, it's totally fine.
-I knew you'd figure it out, Senta-dono.

122
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,423
You must like this kind of thing.

123
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,343
Ah, w… well, perhaps…

124
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,096
We can really count on you.
Except to take watch.

125
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,183
If your theory is true, we're in trouble.

126
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,936
A thousand-year-old scheme…

127
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,689
I wonder if we three can
actually accomplish anything.

128
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,943
For all we know, Gabimaru
and the others are long dead.

129
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,322
No, I'm sure he's alive.

130
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,200
And I'm sure he hasn't given up.

131
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,537
He's likely out there somewhere
with some kind of plan.

132
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,039
So that he can return
to the person he misses.

133
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,293
That is the type of man Gabimaru is.

134
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:51,257
If you know Lord Tensen's secrets,
or how best to fight him,

135
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,342
please tell me.

136
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,893
If there's some power I can
use to fight Lord Tensen,

137
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,353
please tell me.

138
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,899
-Tao.
-Tao?

139
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,652
Is that what you call power?

140
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,240
Tao… Strong… Weak…

141
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,995
Mind… Body… Strong… Weak…

142
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,455
Tanden…

143
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,040
Combine…

144
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,459
Strong… Weak…

145
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,295
Scared?

146
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,300
-Tao… Strong… Weak…
-I don't understand at all.

147
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,929
"Tanden"… I think we call
that the navel in martial arts.

148
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,390
Strictly speaking
it's just under the navel.

149
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,935
In Chinese medicine it represents
a meridian for life energy.

150
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,188
So, what is "Tao" then?

151
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,439
I don't know.

152
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,944
Tao is the energy that
flows through all things.

153
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,697
The energy that flows through all things?

154
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,200
Does Lord Tensen control it?

155
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,743
They do.

156
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,330
Everything in this world is created
by the transmigration of Tao.

157
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,709
To feel Tao is to feel the
origins of all things in nature.

158
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,544
I don't get it.

159
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,547
That's because it's from
a particular religious belief.

160
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,468
I suppose it must difficult to explain
it in a way that we could understand.

161
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,098
Isn't there some hot teacher out there

162
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,475
who would be good at explaining it to us?

163
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,832
If you do things like that,
I'll never want to train you.

164
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,421
I'm begging you, Master!
Please teach me how to use a sword!

165
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,673
You promised, remember!

166
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,051
<i>You promised we'd avenge Tenza together!</i>

167
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,804
It's no good.

168
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,435
<i>I don't want to watch</i>
<i>any more young lives be lost.</i>

169
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,979
I will fight alone.

170
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,483
I will avenge him, but I don't intend
to wait for you to improve.

171
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,403
I want to fight too! Master!

172
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,489
As I said, I'm not your master.

173
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,618
-I haven't taught you anything.
-I'm still calling you Master!

174
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,871
You aren't just anyone.

175
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:31,792
<i>When I attacked you from behind…</i>
<i>You can't just say that was intuition!</i>

176
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,671
Please…

177
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,715
Please teach me too…

178
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,970
I don't want to watch
any more people I love die…

179
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,224
I can't take it anymore!

180
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,479
Please…

181
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,231
be my master…

182
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,737
I can't teach you that kind of
intuition in one lesson.

183
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,697
It's too complicated.

184
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,993
Everything in the world has
its own characteristic waves.

185
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,121
-Waves?
-Yes.

186
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,790
Waves that course around our bodies.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,044
<i>I can perceive them.</i>

188
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:20,257
It's how I know how tall and heavy you
are, and even that your hair is tied up.

189
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,260
-Are you telling the truth?
-Of course.

190
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,971
Using the waves

191
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,016
not only gives you intuition,
but also physical abilities.

192
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,310
If you reach the peak of Tao,

193
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,021
you will attain the power
and body of a god.

194
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,983
In order to harness perception,
you must put your mind in order.

195
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,028
It can neither be
too tempestuous, nor too calm.

196
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,032
Tao… Mind… Strong… Weak…

197
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,912
Stillness and movement…
Yin and Yang…That cycle…

198
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,916
That transmigration is
the key to drawing out Tao.

199
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,502
In between anger and calm,

200
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,254
or in their coexistence.

201
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,757
You have must assume
such a state within your mind.

202
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,010
Once you can do that,
it's easier to sense the waves.

203
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,055
In Buddhism, they call it the Middle Path.

204
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,810
That mindset can draw out
your latent abilities.

205
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,811
For example,

206
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,481
dodging a power greater than yours,

207
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,193
or receiving a mortal wound and surviving.

208
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,405
But this is not something
you master quickly.

209
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,991
To start with, there are
many things even I don't know.

210
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,786
-In that case, we could start with sword--
-You have to go back to basics.

211
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,496
Your stance is terrible.

212
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,875
What? Then how should I stand?

213
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,840
First, your left hand should
go on the meridian line.

214
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,426
Your right shoulder and foot
should face the same way.

215
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,762
Your grip should only
be tight when attacking.

216
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,681
Any other time, hold it lightly.

217
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,475
-Don't wave it around recklessly.
<i>-Huh?</i>

218
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,020
-Focus on the grip of your left hand.
<i>-He's teaching me?</i>

219
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,980
<i>Just out of habit? Or on purpose?</i>

220
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,443
Killing is forbidden.

221
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,322
-All lives are precious!
-Master!

222
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,411
The speed of your sword is important.

223
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,164
Don't let it soak in blood.
The blade will last longer.

224
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,546
<i>All of these creatures have</i>
<i>their own characteristic waves.</i>

225
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,090
<i>I can perceive them.</i>

226
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,641
Don't rely on your arm strength.
Use the weight of your sword.

227
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,184
It's less tiring.

228
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,686
Twist the hips at the end only.

229
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,648
Bend your knees and stand tall.

230
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,363
I can't be your teacher.

231
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,323
In my position, it would be inappropriate.

232
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,910
However, if you want to learn,
you should do so.

233
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,164
Yes, Master!

234
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,335
<i>But you won't be a match for that monster.</i>

235
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,671
<i>You need to drill strikes, but…</i>

236
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,548
<i>This island won't allow time for that.</i>

237
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,512
For goodness' sake. Can't even
have a conversation here.

238
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:19,019
So if this "Tao" could be
a way to kill Lord Tensen…

239
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,314
It's not like we can take time
to learn the basics.

240
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,818
We'll have to learn how to
fight them through battles!

241
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,445
We've got the perfect sparring buddies!

242
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,828
Now! Teach us how to use
this Tao power, little lady!

243
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,082
Honestly. What an ill-mannered man.

244
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,753
<i>What's with…</i>

245
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,089
<i>that one?</i>

246
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,093
<i>If you throw a human in a hole,</i>

247
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,096
<i>it will eventually combine</i>
<i>with flowers. That's the idea.</i>

248
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,099
You developed something amazing, Mu Dan.

249
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,978
Now we can make really effective elixirs.

250
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,606
Make sure you don't kill the human
before you put it the hole.

251
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,860
What if it tries to climb out?

252
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,780
If you weaken it enough, the pit
will be too deep for a human to escape.

253
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,076
Plus… The inner defenses
will hold it back.

254
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,831
<i>They all love to invite</i>
<i>others to join them.</i>

255
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,459
<i>Once they get a hold, they don't let go.</i>

256
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,116
<i>That was not an enemy</i>
<i>we could take down by force.</i>

257
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,368
<i>We need to assess the situation.</i>

258
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,537
B… Brother?

259
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,208
Those assholes… We're going
to kill them, Toma.

260
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,089
-We need to get off the island and tend--
-We're going to kill them, Toma.

261
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,383
-B… but--
-We're going to kill them, Toma.

262
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,053
Okay…

263
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,766
-Then let's make a plan.
-We don't need a plan.

264
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,267
But how…

265
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,146
Generally, those creatures'
bottom halves are their weakness.

266
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,275
<i>When I slashed that monster in half,</i>

267
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,403
<i>he regenerated from his upper body.</i>

268
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,031
<i>Not from his head or his heart.</i>

269
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,410
So that means the center
of his body is the groin or the navel.

270
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,746
He seemed kind of plant-like.

271
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,250
I wouldn't be surprised if his lower half
is his weakness, like roots.

272
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,793
<i>Impressive as always.</i>

273
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>He sorted the situation and made a plan.</i>

274
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,924
-What?
-Nothing.

275
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,968
I was just digesting.

276
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,804
Digesting what? Oh, right.

277
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,270
You want to try it now too? Monster meat.

278
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,939
No! And they're not monsters--

279
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,943
You should have some. We need
to get back our strength.

280
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,697
-Brother!
-Oh, so you <i>were</i> still alive.

281
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,453
Pardon me. My apologies
for the sudden interruption.

282
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,456
Please do not be alarmed.

283
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,209
-Who are you?
-It doesn't matter.

284
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,629
It's a monster. We'll kill it.

285
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,758
No. I have intelligence.

286
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,512
Let's talk. I am only here
for reconnaissance…

287
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,764
On Lord Tensen's orders.

288
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:48,562
Is Lord Tensen that guy
who was also a girl?

289
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,814
Indeed. Our master.

290
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:56,445
<i>You, as well as the other humans</i>
<i>who arrived on the island,</i>

291
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,656
<i>are currently being</i>
<i>scouted by my comrades.</i>

292
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,409
<i>We are Doshi.</i>

293
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,036
Doshi?

294
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,788
That monster said something about Soshin…

295
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,498
That is a grave misunderstanding.

296
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,627
<i>Soshin are worthless beings</i>
<i>that lack intelligence.</i>

297
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,838
<i>They are trash,</i>
<i>not even permitted to enter Horai.</i>

298
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:20,093
We Doshi are the personal disciples
to Lord Tensen. Right-hand men.

299
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,889
Within the castle,
we learn from, take care of,

300
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,225
and do troublesome tasks for Lord Tensen.

301
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,602
That is our job.

302
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,605
Horai… Inside the castle…

303
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,232
Therefore, I must make a request.

304
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,110
Please quietly return to
the pit and become Tan.

305
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,657
Barbarian!

306
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,117
Brother!

307
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,583
What… is this strength?

308
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,757
-You are beyond human. Perhaps Tao is--
-Shut up.

309
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,261
If you are some friend
of this Lord Tensen,

310
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,890
beating you up is the shortest distance
to get to those guys.

311
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,643
I can't believe how perfect this is.

312
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,479
I'll question you with my fists.

313
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,901
Very well. If you do not wish
to resolve this peacefully.

314
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,904
We have recourse
for such a situation as well.

315
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,408
Foolish, sinful humans!

316
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,912
You will soon realize you would have liked
it better if you had quietly become Tan.

317
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,666
-Brother--
-Toma! You kill the small fry.

318
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,751
I'm counting on you.

319
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,754
Understood.

320
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,553
Brother, you focus on him!

321
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,514
<i>This man is strong.</i>

322
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,726
<i>But he is considerably fatigued.</i>

323
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,021
<i>Looking at the flow of Tao,</i>
<i>it's clear as day.</i>

324
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,655
<i>Moving like this</i>
<i>with such injuries… Astounding.</i>

325
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,907
<i>But it is meaningless.</i>

326
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,161
<i>Attacks from someone</i>
<i>who can't use Tao are but a trifle.</i>

327
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,414
<i>He has aptitude, but at this level…</i>

328
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,417
<i>Attacks without using Tao</i>
<i>are either ineffective</i>

329
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,044
<i>or I can regenerate quickly.</i>

330
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,008
<i>Astounding. However…</i>

331
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,512
<i>He is blind to the disorder of Tao…</i>
<i>That's a weakness!</i>

332
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,066
Brother!

333
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,906
