1
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,929
You sure have a good appetite.
It's a good thing.

2
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,681
Grow big and strong, Rokurota.

3
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,145
Snack time is over?
Is it play time already?

4
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,950
Play.

5
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,291
Get back, Sagiri!

6
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,389
Lord Genji!

7
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,727
You need medical attention.

8
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,772
Run… Sagiri…

9
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,191
I'm not going to make it.

10
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,445
Hurry… run…

11
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,461
Gabimaru.

12
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,716
Is he one of the sinners,
or is he a monster?

13
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,260
I don't see any damage on him.

14
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,848
That is… The Giant of Bizen, Rokurota.

15
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,975
The beheader in charge of him is…

16
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,979
Lord Eizen.

17
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,360
<i>His eyes are like</i>
<i>an animal preying on its catch.</i>

18
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>Escaping as a group is nearly impossible.</i>

19
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,324
I have no choice…

20
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,492
<i>but to kill it.</i>

21
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,495
<i>But how should I do this?</i>

22
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,207
<i>My kick was practically useless.</i>

23
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,001
<i>His strength rivals that</i>
<i>of the shinobi of Iwagakure.</i>

24
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,755
The Law of the Shinobi, rule number nine.

25
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:38,051
Analyze your enemy's capabilities.

26
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,387
<i>I need to know its strength first.</i>

27
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,073
Get back or you'll die!

28
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,325
But…

29
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,952
<i>It has more strength than me.</i>

30
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,829
How long are you going to
stand there and watch?

31
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,833
Help me and show me your ninja skills.

32
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,710
Fight together as promised.

33
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,214
Yeah, yeah. I'll keep my promise.

34
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,594
Remember, you give us strength.
And I give you intel.

35
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,974
Go Gabimaru! You can do it, Gabimaru!

36
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,476
Go, go! You can do it! You're almighty.

37
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,979
Gabimaru! Good luck!

38
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>What an immense swing.</i>

39
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>Maybe if I focus on destroying its fist…</i>

40
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,039
<i>His detection and response are fast.</i>

41
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,083
<i>Above all, it's intuitive.</i>

42
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,586
<i>That hand is indefensible.</i>
<i>If it touches me, I'm dead.</i>

43
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>If that's the case…</i>
<i>Ninja Art, Thunder Stones.</i>

44
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,978
<i>This type of attack doesn't work on him.</i>

45
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,482
<i>Ninja Art, Flexible Blade.</i>

46
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>It's as strong as a steel sword,</i>
<i>but it's useless too.</i>

47
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,489
NINJA ART
FLEXIBLE BLADE

48
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,409
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

49
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,454
<i>I have to think of an attack</i>
<i>that I can use from a distance.</i>

50
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,751
Enough already. Don't waste your time.

51
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,005
Hurry… get out of here, Sagiri.

52
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,923
Don't give up, Sir!

53
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,259
I can save you
as long as I stop the bleeding.

54
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,345
You're strange.

55
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,476
Before, you were daring like a man.

56
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,022
But now I feel the compassion of a woman.

57
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,524
This is not a matter of man or woman.

58
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,486
I just don't want you to die!

59
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,160
Is that your way of life?

60
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,749
Whether man or woman,
whether strong or weak,

61
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,795
you accept opposites as they are,
not dividing them.

62
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,800
The Middle Way.
That is what you truly believe in.

63
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,179
I finally understand.

64
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,684
The sword is the heart of a samurai.

65
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,145
I entrust this to you.

66
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:42,026
Rokurota likely killed Eizen.

67
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,990
If you are a true samurai,

68
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,576
I won't tell you to run anymore.

69
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,580
Kill Rokurota.

70
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,961
Please, Yamada Asaemon Sagiri.

71
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,719
<i>Close combat is dangerous</i>
<i>and weapons are useless.</i>

72
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,223
<i>If only I could use a fire technique.</i>

73
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,856
<i>If there are two of us,</i>
<i>maybe I could create a blind spot.</i>

74
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,657
If I put the blade into
the stretched muscles,

75
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,660
I can cut even the most well-trained body.

76
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,163
No matter how abnormal you may be.

77
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,415
<i>It's the same as beheading.</i>

78
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,419
<i>You need to know the body's skeletal</i>
<i>structure and weave through the gaps.</i>

79
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,297
This is… the sword of Yamada Asaemon.

80
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,092
Gabimaru.

81
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,179
You're just in time.
I needed a helping hand.

82
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,056
-Please give me a hand.
-Please give me a hand.

83
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,394
Um… I'd like to go and tend to the others.

84
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,063
Huh? But it's too late now.

85
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,942
Plus, you're not in the position
to do that, right?

86
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:11,073
All this racket they're causing
and I don't see one monster in sight.

87
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,910
Don't you think
this observation is more useful?

88
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,289
If they die, I'll just make a run for it.

89
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,375
His bleeding has already stopped.

90
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,712
That wasn't enough to inflict damage.

91
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,215
We need to kill him with one blow.

92
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,300
The only way is to aim for the neck.

93
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,386
But I can't reach his neck. It's too high.

94
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,055
So we'll split into two.

95
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,974
You go for the leg
and bring him down on his knees.

96
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,393
-You make it sound so easy.
-Huh?

97
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,189
You can do it, right?

98
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,902
I'll distract him.

99
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,915
What the--!

100
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,965
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

101
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,344
<i>He's the execution target</i>
<i>and the one who hurt Genji.</i>

102
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,474
<i>If I'm too eager,</i>
<i>I'll lose my grip on the sword.</i>

103
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,854
<i>Be calmer. Be rational, not compassionate.</i>

104
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,985
He's coming. Cut him again!

105
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,867
<i>My foot… Did I mess it up</i>
<i>when I tried to dodge the last attack?</i>

106
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,370
<i>Fending it off unscathed</i>
<i>requires great skill.</i>

107
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,873
<i>A mere slap can be like a cannon.</i>

108
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,085
<i>I have to stay calm.</i>
<i>One hit and I'm done for.</i>

109
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,467
It's impossible to cut him
unless he's still.

110
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,636
When he moves,
the gap between the bones closes.

111
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,887
I cannot get the blade in.

112
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,891
<i>In a beheading, we cut the neck</i>
<i>with the head hanging down.</i>

113
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,020
To finish it with a single blow,
we need the neck in a crouched position.

114
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,856
But if the blade cannot even
pass through the limbs,

115
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,526
getting him in that position
is almost impossible.

116
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,572
I'd say we're in a pickle.

117
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,036
Is that sound… coming from his stomach?

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,418
What the heck is this?!

119
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,920
What a loud sound.

120
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,435
Gabimaru!

121
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>I knew we were dealing</i>
<i>with a giant with brute strength but…</i>

122
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,653
<i>I think I can endure this.</i>

123
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,404
<i>By the skin of my teeth.</i>

124
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,827
No!

125
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,999
<i>This is bad.</i>
<i>I have to get back on my feet.</i>

126
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,002
<i>This isn't fatal. I have to get up!</i>

127
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,551
<i>Its over…</i>

128
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,430
<i>Stay calm. I need to deal with this</i>
<i>in a calm manner.</i>

129
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>Keep your emotions under control.</i>
<i>Be rational.</i>

130
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,145
<i>Stay calm. Let go of any rage.</i>

131
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,939
<i>Create a calm mind.</i>

132
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,943
The Middle Way.
That is what you truly believe in.

133
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,694
<i>Don't divide them.</i>

134
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,449
<i>Accept… opposites as they are.</i>

135
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,579
<i>Both in feeling and reason.</i>

136
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,140
<i>Let your emotions be your strength.</i>
<i>Never lose sight of your reason.</i>

137
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>Neither be still nor furious.</i>

138
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,727
<i>Choose the middle way!</i>

139
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,777
She's amazing.

140
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,406
She's 12 in rank in swordsmanship but…

141
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,326
the rank of the Yamada family
is not determined by pure skill alone.

142
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,247
It is based on the suitability of
the next head of the family clan.

143
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,791
If you are a woman,
you will be treated unfairly.

144
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,378
If it is based solely on skill, she is…

145
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,799
<i>As a soldier on the battlefield,</i>
<i>Sagiri lacks experience.</i>

146
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:44,305
<i>But… when her purpose</i>
<i>and heart are aligned,</i>

147
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,682
<i>and when all her hesitation disappears,</i>

148
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,935
<i>her swordsmanship is more than first rate.</i>

149
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,817
She may shrink away from
the monsters on the island,

150
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,777
but as an Asaemon,

151
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,448
she doesn't even flinch
when dealing with sinners.

152
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,826
She's a stubborn one.

153
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,121
<i>I was right.</i>

154
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,332
<i>I knew from the time I first met her,</i>

155
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,084
<i>this woman… is strong.</i>

156
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,843
<i>Aim…</i>

157
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,971
<i>for the crouched neck.</i>

158
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,109
This isn't going to be easy.

159
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,696
Can we somehow keep its head down?

160
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,074
It might be a bit risky,

161
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,369
but I have a plan.

162
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,879
<i>The Giant of Bizen.</i>
<i>Getting up close to him is suicide.</i>

163
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,548
<i>Weapons are useless.</i>

164
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,760
<i>The only way is to use a sword to cut</i>
<i>through the tissue, then cut off the head.</i>

165
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>Not only is</i>
<i>superior physical ability required, but</i>

166
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:14,687
<i>we need the skills of a true beheader,</i>
<i>the skills of a Yamada Asaemon.</i>

167
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,943
<i>But with that massive body and swiftness,</i>
<i>how can we get the blade in him?</i>

168
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,069
<i>If that's the case…</i>

169
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,952
Oh, shit!

170
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,454
We have to get out of here, Senta.

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,676
Ninja Art, Giant Stone, Fire Monk Version.

174
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,723
Ninja Art, Thorn Quilt, Fire Monk Version.

175
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,817
You can't go on any longer.

176
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,070
You've already done enough.

177
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,077
How far are we going to go?

178
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,747
As far as we can,
you four-eyed raccoon dog.

179
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,958
Their target isn't Rokurota.

180
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,210
<i>They plan to burn the entire area.</i>

181
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,964
-No way.
-They're gonna use the smoke.

182
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,592
A lot of smoke will burn
from the oil in the trees.

183
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,595
<i>Once the trees and leaves start burning,</i>
<i>smoke will quickly build up.</i>

184
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,682
<i>The nature of the smoke is that</i>
<i>it moves towards the top.</i>

185
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,976
<i>If he cries and moves around,</i>
<i>he'll be short of breath,</i>

186
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,853
<i>and breathe in a ton of smoke.</i>

187
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,525
The only thing more harmful
than fire or heat is the poison

188
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,070
in the smoke
which causes fainting if inhaled.

189
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,987
Poison?

190
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,490
<i>That is, carbon monoxide.</i>

191
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,368
<i>It combines with</i>
<i>the hemoglobin in the blood,</i>

192
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,455
<i>and causes rapid depletion of oxygen</i>
<i>throughout the body.</i>

193
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,124
<i>Also known as carbon monoxide poisoning.</i>

194
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,587
That was intense, but as long as you
stay low, you won't breath in smoke.

195
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,339
We're safe down here.

196
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,757
I feel like I'll burn to death.

197
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,594
Will we go down first?

198
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,597
Or will it come down to us?

199
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,997
Cut him now! Do it before he gets back up!

200
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,549
<i>Stay calm,</i>

201
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,011
<i>yet be fierce.</i>

202
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,819
<i>I'm hungry. I wanna play.</i>

203
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,362
<i>I wanna play! I wanna play!</i>

204
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

205
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,158
<i>I'm hungry!</i>

206
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,745
<i>Why don't I get full?</i>

207
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>Why won't anyone play with me?</i>

208
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,668
Sorry for getting you worked up.

209
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,379
I scared you, didn't I?

210
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,507
I'm sorry. It's because I'm inexperienced.

211
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,928
But you don't need to worry anymore.

212
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,681
No one hates you.

213
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,559
There's no one who hates you now.

214
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,854
The perished soul…

215
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,274
May you rest quietly in peace.

216
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,198
The flames are getting stronger.

217
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,452
The monsters may come for us.
Let's get out of here.

218
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,295
Lord Genji.

219
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,548
Hey! Hurry up or you'll burn to death.

220
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,351
<i>Never mind sinners,</i>

221
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,354
<i>we can't even mourn our comrades.</i>

222
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,857
<i>We must keep our hearts strong,</i>
<i>and stay strong.</i>

223
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,612
<i>Stay strong…</i>

224
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,324
<i>Whether strong or weak,</i>

225
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,660
<i>you accept opposites as they are,</i>
<i>not dividing them.</i>

226
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,247
<i>That is what you truly believe in.</i>

227
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,761
They came after us after all.

228
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,139
They're going
in the direction of the flames.

229
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:05,144
Normally it's an animal's
natural instinct to avoid fire.

230
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,647
Now we know for sure that
they aren't natural life forms.

231
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,442
I have no choice.

232
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,987
Let's go to where the monsters are.

233
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,029
Isn't it dangerous?

234
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,575
I guess… but we have no choice.

235
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,370
For now, the monsters are
our only clue to the elixir.

236
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,666
I'm still hurt from earlier.

237
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,460
I want to rest.
This is all a pain in the ass.

238
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,755
-Do you want to turn back then?
-No!

239
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,093
If it's a clue, no matter how small
or dangerous, I won't give up.

240
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,804
I will find the elixir

241
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,890
and I'll see my wife as soon as possible.

242
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,895
And you? Aren't you worried about
the safety of your comrades?

243
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,068
<i>Everyone here,</i>

244
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,154
<i>is risking their lives</i>
<i>to fulfill their role.</i>

245
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,907
<i>Excessive concern would be disrespectful.</i>

246
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,037
<i>If we truly care for our comrades,</i>
<i>we need to find the elixir</i>

247
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,789
<i>and relieve them of this role.</i>

248
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,877
We're finally on the same page.

249
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,713
Don't forget that
I'm still watching over you.

250
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,388
It's them.

251
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,809
It's the fox and raccoon dog.
They ran this far?

252
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,151
Hey! Guys! What happened to
working as a team?

253
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,655
Is this…

254
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,532
Is this a village?

255
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,787
What else does it look like?

256
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,416
If this place is indeed Shinsenkyo,

257
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,504
is this the village where the sages live?

258
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,313
This tastes awful!
It doesn't fill my stomach, even a little.

259
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,441
Is it safe to eat that?

260
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,152
I'm not eating it, I'm drinking it.

261
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,489
The blood of animals
makes up the mountains, right?

262
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,994
About what you said earlier,

263
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,454
what about the sages?

264
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,958
They are fictitious people.

265
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,628
<i>A kind of superhuman</i>
<i>in Chinese philosophy.</i>

266
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,048
<i>They usually appear as an old man,</i>
<i>and manipulate mysterious arts.</i>

267
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,717
<i>They are said to be immortal.</i>

268
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,469
<i>And they may be on this island.</i>

269
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,473
Essentially, the inhabitants
of this Paradise are sages,

270
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,474
not monsters.

271
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,935
Bull shit.

272
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,396
Let's just kill those old men then.

273
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,481
Maybe this time,
they'll satisfy my appetite.

274
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,984
You're joking, right?

275
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,739
Brother?

276
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,824
I sense something.

277
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,495
The next one better be tasty.

278
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,865
