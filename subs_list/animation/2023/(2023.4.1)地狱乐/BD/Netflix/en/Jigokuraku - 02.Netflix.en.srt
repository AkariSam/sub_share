1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,089
<i>One day, a criminal who was a storyteller</i>

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,759
<i>asked to be beheaded</i>
<i>in the middle of a storytelling session.</i>

3
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>My father, Yamada Asaemon Kichiji,</i>

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,357
<i>granted the request.</i>

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>The storyteller ended his act</i>

6
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,092
<i>with a punch line, as his head fell off.</i>

7
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,930
<i>Even he himself didn't realize he was cut.</i>

8
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,516
<i>Free from unnecessary pain and emotion,</i>

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,601
<i>it was the perfect cut.</i>

10
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,731
<i>From that day, my father's sword</i>

11
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,483
<i>became my goal.</i>

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,466
What an amazing cut!

13
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,510
Though you're a woman, great work.

14
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,304
Thank you.

15
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,856
I see fear…

16
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,236
in your sword. I see hesitation and fear.

17
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,280
You will let the sinner suffer and die.

18
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,201
I'll do better.

19
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,389
Sagiri, look at your sword.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,644
The sword reflects the truth.

21
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>A sword weighed down by fear</i>

22
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>makes the sinner suffer,</i>

23
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,025
<i>weighing down the sword more.</i>

24
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,739
<i>How can I… How can I have a heart…</i>

25
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>with no hesitation and fear?</i>

26
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,247
<i>Like my father.</i>

27
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,545
<i>What if…</i>

28
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>there was a life I could kill</i>

29
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,178
<i>without hesitation?</i>

30
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,823
Welcome, you sinners.

31
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,077
Here we have, the 11th barbarian general,

32
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,579
Lord Nariyoshi Tokugawa.

33
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,290
He is someone incomparable,

34
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,583
especially to sinners like yourselves.

35
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,252
-What the hell?
-What nerve you have!

36
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,587
-Are you kidding me!
-Who the hell is this guy?!

37
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,841
Is it safe to gather this many criminals?

38
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,718
It's the lord's order.

39
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,474
<i>The robber who killed 30 men,</i>
<i>Tanio Seikichi</i>

40
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,521
<i>Nikimaru, a serial arsonist.</i>

41
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,733
<i>A murder accomplice, Kido Shukan.</i>

42
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,819
<i>These are all thugs</i>
<i>who caused an uproar in society.</i>

43
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,699
I can't breathe.

44
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,035
I wanna see Tokugawa in person.

45
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:27,994
No, you cannot.

46
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,747
From now, you are all under my orders!

47
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,749
You will go to Shinsenkyo,

48
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,793
and bring back the elixir of immortality.

49
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,879
The one who succeeds

50
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,006
will receive a full pardon.

51
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,758
Really? Did you hear that?

52
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,261
By the terms of this royal pardon.

53
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,557
<i>The atmosphere has changed.</i>

54
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,814
With that, I can kill more people again.

55
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,024
<i>Adachi Matagoro,</i>

56
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,070
<i>A man who killed women and children</i>
<i>just for pleasure.</i>

57
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,530
<i>A man of pure evil. If it's…</i>

58
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,785
<i>a sinner who deserves to die,</i>
<i>can I kill him without hesitation?</i>

59
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,052
Are you Gabimaru the Hollow?

60
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,305
I could tell right away by
your hair color and height.

61
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,308
You're a big name where we come from.

62
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,310
But…

63
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,772
What a disappointment.

64
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,233
You're a lot shorter than they say,

65
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,902
you're shabby, and short.

66
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,696
And you're tied up.

67
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,949
Sorry to disappoint you.

68
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,202
<i>True, I was a little wary of him at first,</i>

69
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,914
<i>but now he's like a different person.</i>

70
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,501
<i>Is he the same as the other sinners?</i>

71
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,254
<i>Or is he like the rumors say?</i>

72
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,464
<i>Or is he more evil than what they say?</i>

73
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,181
I will now explain the island
where you will be heading to.

74
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,851
The island is like a paradise…

75
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,061
-I heard that already!
-This is nonsense!

76
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,813
You reading us a fairytale?

77
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,983
Remove your papers, you sinners.

78
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,489
I can finally breathe.

79
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,670
He was the only back-up soldier who
returned from the recent island survey.

80
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,382
As you can see, he is no longer a person.

81
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,682
<i>When he returned,</i>
<i>he had bumps all over his body.</i>

82
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,686
<i>The next day, they blossomed.</i>

83
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,356
Besides him,
sixty odd members of the survey team

84
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,691
are still missing.

85
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,904
What happened on the island?

86
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,450
We have no clue since our only witness
is in this state.

87
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,953
No one told us about that!

88
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,289
No need to make a fuss.

89
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,667
How mystical and beautiful
that a man can turn into a flower.

90
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,462
Especially for sinners like you!

91
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,215
What the hell?!

92
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,510
-I'm not going anywhere!
-Don't screw with us!

93
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,680
Enough! You're all condemned to death,

94
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,848
but you'll be acquitted,

95
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,226
and even be given a chance
to go to the Pure Land.

96
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,394
Don't you fools understand

97
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,979
the deep compassion of the court?

98
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,735
No one knows anything
about the island, right?

99
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,780
What if there's no elixir?

100
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,281
He's right!

101
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,866
We can come back empty handed then?

102
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,410
Excuses!

103
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,747
If you are dissatisfied, you can leave.

104
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,873
This is voluntary.

105
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,585
I'm out then. This is creepy.

106
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,256
I'd rather die in front of my henchmen
waiting for me at the jail--

107
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,056
I forgot to mention one thing.

108
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,142
When you go ashore, you will
be accompanied by an escort.

109
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,728
An escort?

110
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,858
Your death sentence
has already been decided.

111
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,902
The same applies on the island.

112
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,571
Which means that…

113
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,082
If you make any odd moves on the island,

114
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,667
you will be beheaded on the spot.

115
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,754
Yamada Asaemon will accompany you
as watchmen.

116
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,924
Don't get any funny ideas.

117
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,926
Don't forget
you're dealing with the Yamada Clan.

118
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,929
If you turn on them,
you will end up like him.

119
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,515
If you kill your escort intentionally,

120
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,935
or by accident, you will be beheaded.

121
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,938
You will not be allowed on the return trip

122
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,189
unless you are accompanied by an escort.

123
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,192
-Is that true?
-Yes.

124
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,028
I see.

125
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,447
<i>This guy…</i>

126
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,450
<i>Does he have balls or does he not?</i>

127
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,452
Hey, come here!

128
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,207
Ok, yes sir.

129
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,461
Sorry, I have one more thing.

130
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,465
We need to narrow down the number
before we leave for the island.

131
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,637
Not everyone will
be able to land on the island.

132
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,182
The capacity of the ship and

133
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,642
the number of watchmen are limited.

134
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,395
So I need you to narrow down
the number of people now.

135
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,606
Narrow down?

136
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,399
You don't get it, do you?

137
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,152
In other words…

138
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,530
Get rid of the wimps
right here, right now. Correct?

139
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,659
What the hell are you doing?

140
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,911
Look.

141
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,914
The fact that he's not saying anything
proves it.

142
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,668
He's telling us to kill each other!

143
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,670
You'll die if you're too slow.

144
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,091
Well, it can't be helped
if you take it that way.

145
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,467
If you die here,

146
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,427
it means you're useless anyway.

147
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,890
Oh, and don't take off your ropes.

148
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,105
This is it!

149
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,649
In this day and age, it's not every day

150
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,734
that you have to
risk your life in a fight.

151
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,738
I've always wanted to see
something like this.

152
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,740
<i>What a fool this man is.</i>

153
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,702
<i>What's the point in doing this anyway?</i>

154
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,372
<i>You can't fight a man being tied.</i>

155
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,624
<i>Tangled and entrapped…</i>

156
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>Everyone's going to end up being useless.</i>

157
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,758
Who are the ones marked with the red ink?

158
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,053
Among the sinners,

159
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,139
those with extraordinary abilities.

160
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,391
They are men who are truly worthy

161
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,018
of being called "extraordinary."

162
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,771
Those marked with the red ink

163
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,607
are for example, him.

164
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,568
A young man who led a band of thieves,

165
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,030
and established a village of thieves
deep in the Mountains of Iyo.

166
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,034
That woman was the criminal

167
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,036
in last year's
Sagiba Castle invasion riot.

168
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,329
She's a woman ninja

169
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,207
who subdued
every single vassal in the castle.

170
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,217
The great swordsman known as
"Sword Dragon" or "Eight State Warrior."

171
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,180
A giant man who is said
to eat a bear from it's head.

172
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,558
Neither a sword or a spear
could scrape him.

173
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,438
This is like a picture scroll of the
Warring States Period.

174
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,775
The main highlight is the living legend,

175
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,735
Gabimaru the Hollow.

176
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,278
He's right over there.

177
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,991
Hm? He's not moving at all.

178
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,244
The legendary…?

179
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,669
Is the pressure getting to you, Sagiri?

180
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,796
Lord Eizen.

181
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,966
It's going to be harsher
once we're on the island.

182
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,886
Not only between the criminals,

183
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,430
but your life is at risk too.

184
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,351
When that happens, can you slay them?

185
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,358
Let me tell you this
since I have the chance.

186
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,238
This job is not for you.

187
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,494
Why would a woman go to the trouble
of wielding a sword?

188
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,582
If you are a daughter of a samurai family,
you should live quietly in your palace.

189
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,419
And live a life far from
a beheading executioner.

190
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,094
With all due respect, Lord Eizen.

191
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,139
If I could have done so, I would have.

192
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,072
<i>In addition to test cutting</i>
<i>with human bodies,</i>

193
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,159
<i>beheadings, and the making of medicine</i>
<i>using the human corpse.</i>

194
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,163
<i>Even if you didn't wield a sword,</i>
<i>if you were born into the Yamada family,</i>

195
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,917
<i>you feed on the death of others.</i>

196
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,550
Take that!

197
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,346
It's the daughter of Asa the Decapitator!

198
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,056
The daughter of the cannibal Asa!

199
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,557
Murderer!

200
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,645
Come out!

201
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,313
Take that!

202
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,154
<i>No matter how much you turn away…</i>

203
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,424
<i>The truth is reflected in the sword.</i>

204
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,391
We've got no choice.

205
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,935
Let's break through these samurai and
get out of here!

206
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:18,852
Brother!

207
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,355
That samurai over there is a woman!

208
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,191
Let's kill her and take her sword!

209
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,155
Can you slay him?

210
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,122
<i>I can't escape from the beheader's work.</i>

211
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,124
<i>If so…</i>

212
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,210
<i>I can't just sit back and accept it.</i>

213
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,878
<i>I won't!</i>

214
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,881
<i>I want to judge</i>

215
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,633
<i>my own actions for myself.</i>

216
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,318
<i>Why?</i>

217
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,698
<i>Why?</i>

218
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,579
Why do you think it's okay to kill people?

219
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,336
Can't you think of another way?

220
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,089
How did you…? Get back!

221
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,342
Not all murderers like to kill.

222
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,344
What are the guards doing?

223
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,597
How can anyone stand this?

224
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,850
How rude of you
to speak to the Lord in that way!

225
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,604
I would prefer not to kill.

226
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,272
Isn't that a normal thought.

227
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,568
What is an outlaw like you saying?

228
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,653
If you don't like it, leave it.

229
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,238
That's all.

230
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,575
You don't get it.

231
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,579
Hey, you guys over there.

232
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,084
Kill him
and you'll be on the landing party.

233
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,920
Seriously?

234
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,340
Don't move.

235
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,761
You don't want to kill
for nothing, do you?

236
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,181
I don't mind. If I can survive,

237
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,059
I'd be glad to kill you.

238
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,771
-Don't avoid it!
-Why don't we talk?

239
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,524
If you don't want to fight,
just shut up and die!

240
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,279
I have no choice.

241
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,532
I'll have to kill you.

242
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,369
If you're going to kill me,
I'll have to kill you.

243
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,166
I thought you didn't want that.

244
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,420
I don't. But…

245
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,340
I can't die either.

246
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,176
I have no choice.

247
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,013
What the hell are you saying?

248
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,682
My heart feels heavy,

249
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,268
when I think about
what I will have to bear.

250
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,441
I don't want to do this. I really don't.

251
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,663
What a monster!

252
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,415
So that is…

253
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,214
the Hollow.

254
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,009
<i>My heart feels heavy…</i>

255
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,805
<i>when I think about</i>
<i>what I will have to bear.</i>

256
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,358
What a cruel and brutal way
to kill someone.

257
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,364
If I did it nicely,
would they not hate me?

258
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,159
<i>What I needed was…</i>

259
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,579
<i>not the strength to fear killing.</i>

260
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,670
<i>But to be prepared to bear that fear,</i>

261
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,338
<i>to bear the lives of those I've killed.</i>

262
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,848
Sagiri, are you okay?

263
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,851
Maybe this job is too much for you.

264
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,356
No, sir. I will kill him.

265
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,611
That's enough, sinners!

266
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,197
You are hereby declared the landing party.

267
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,118
The Bandit King, Aza Chobei.

268
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,621
The Blade Dragon, Tamiya Gantetsusai.

269
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,583
Hunter of the Hundred, Warped Keiun.

270
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,127
Nurugai of the Mountains.

271
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,630
Killing Buddha, Horubo.

272
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,134
Rogue Ninja, Gabimaru the Hollow.

273
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:48,140
Cannibal Courtesan, Akaginu.
Yuzuriha of Keishu.

274
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,643
The Apostate, Moro Makiya.

275
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,397
The Giant of Bizen, Rokurota.

276
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,816
The above ten shall be the members.

277
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,402
Each member will be accompanied

278
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,655
by one of the disciples
of the Yamada Clan,

279
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,033
a beheader of Asaemon will accompany you.

280
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,040
<i>You will now board the ship,</i>

281
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,543
<i>and head to a secluded island</i>
<i>in the South Sea,</i>

282
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,629
<i>to search for the elixir of immortality.</i>

283
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,050
<i>If you find it, you are free.</i>

284
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,766
<i>No need to worry.</i>

285
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,018
<i>The destination is</i>
<i>the pure land of paradise.</i>

286
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,896
<i>The land of everlasting life, Shinsenkyo.</i>

287
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,232
<i>There is no danger!</i>

288
