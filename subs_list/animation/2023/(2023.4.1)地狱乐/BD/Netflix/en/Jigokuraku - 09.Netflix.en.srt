1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:03,795
I gave the village a cursory search, but…

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,672
Nothing made sense.

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:09,551
The more I know, the less
I can see the full picture…

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:11,886
Gabimaru?

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,305
Is something wrong?

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,474
It's nothing. So?

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,309
Ah, Senta-dono is…

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,854
Apparently his brain maxed out.

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,689
There are so many mysteries…

10
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,151
If I don't cool down
my brain and organize it…

11
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,571
Please take a break, Senta-dono.

12
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,656
I can take the night watch alone.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,450
No, no. I'm fine.

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,660
I'll be fine after a bath.

15
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,120
You'll be even more tired.

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,455
I'll be fine!

17
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,840
<i>There's so much we don't know…</i>

18
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,343
It's too dangerous to go on
without learning more.

19
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,512
How much more do we need to learn?

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,723
That… I don't know.

21
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:01,102
However, if Lord Tensen is
tasked with protecting the elixir of life,

22
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,897
going to Horai without a plan
would be dangerous.

23
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,692
<i>I'm sorry, but we don't</i>
<i>have time to figure things out.</i>

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,780
<i>It would be faster just to draw them out.</i>

25
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,959
<i>The fog is so thick</i>
<i>I can't see what's around me.</i>

26
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,296
<i>We found this village</i>
<i>in the woods south of the sea.</i>

27
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,464
<i>If Hoko is to be believed,</i>

28
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,552
<i>if we keep going south, we should</i>
<i>get close to Horai in the center.</i>

29
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,733
<i>What am I hearing? Singing?</i>

30
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,444
No…

31
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,118
<i>Sutras?</i>

32
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,953
<i>Are they relatives of Hoko?</i>

33
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,247
<i>They aren't reacting to my presence.</i>

34
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,707
<i>Maybe they can't move.</i>

35
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,629
<i>They're praying to something…</i>

36
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,382
It's too dangerous to go on
without learning more.

37
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,886
<i>That might be true for an Asaemon,</i>
<i>but a sinner is different.</i>

38
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,389
<i>I can't turn back just because</i>
<i>the island is dangerous.</i>

39
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,016
<i>That's not what we're doing here.</i>

40
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,395
<i>No matter how dangerous it is…</i>

41
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,981
<i>if I don't bring back the elixir,</i>
<i>I won't get a pardon.</i>

42
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,525
<i>My only choice is to keep going.</i>

43
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,277
<i>Even if I go alone.</i>

44
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,869
They say the Horai region
is beautiful even now.

45
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,248
<i>Unlike the Hojo and Eishu regions,</i>

46
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>it is where the gods and the Sennin live.</i>

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,877
<i>It is the real Shinsenkyo.</i>

48
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,089
The "real Shinsenkyo"?

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,008
It looks manmade.

50
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,638
<i>If this is Horai,</i>
<i>the elixir could be here…</i>

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,567
<i>What? Something's off…</i>

52
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,321
<i>She looks human, but she's something else…</i>

53
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,907
Who are you?

54
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,326
Man, I quit.

55
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,455
Why is it always on my turn? So annoying.

56
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,458
Hey, can't you just leave?

57
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,961
I just did this.

58
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,465
If I see any humans like you,
I have to capture them, you know.

59
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,384
It had to be me today…

60
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,762
Is it… to turn humans into the elixir?

61
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,194
Oh?

62
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,458
<i>She has regenerative abilities…</i>

63
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,752
<i>and more strength</i>
<i>and speed than she should have.</i>

64
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,254
<i>She must be a…</i>

65
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,138
My neck again?

66
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,182
Ninja Art: Fire Monk!

67
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,083
Did I kill him again?

68
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,337
If I'd brought him in,
he would have made an excellent Tan.

69
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,092
This might be bad timing…

70
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,470
But are you Lord Tensen?

71
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,723
Are you human?

72
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,832
How are you holding up so well?

73
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,835
The last guy was pretty tenacious too.

74
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,463
But I haven't seen someone
like you in centuries.

75
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,466
Where is the elixir?

76
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,184
<i>I should probably consider</i>
<i>any attacks or blows useless.</i>

77
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,148
<i>His arm strength is exceptional.</i>

78
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>If this fight goes on, he'll wear me down.</i>

79
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,903
<i>I'll have to find a</i>
<i>quick way to take him out.</i>

80
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,282
<i>He's an immortal… Fire Monk had no effect.</i>

81
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,368
<i>What haven't I tried yet?</i>

82
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>I need something!</i>

83
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,544
<i>What… was that reaction?</i>

84
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>That was completely</i>
<i>different from other times.</i>

85
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,555
<i>What happened? What worked?</i>

86
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,060
<i>He turned back into a woman.</i>

87
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,688
That strength of yours…

88
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,815
I don't think you know, but it's probably…

89
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
No, it doesn't matter.

90
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,832
You're pissing me off. Die.

91
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,925
<i>What is this?</i>

92
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,807
<i>Wind pressure? No.</i>

93
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,352
<i>Every attack feels like</i>
<i>it echoes inside me.</i>

94
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,230
<i>It's some other kind of unknown power…</i>

95
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,233
<i>Guarding is… useless… Can't… dodge…</i>

96
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,945
<i>Is there no way to take her down fast?</i>

97
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,826
<i>I don't need one!</i>

98
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>I don't have time…</i>

99
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,871
<i>to stand around and think of one!</i>

100
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,582
<i>I have to get back to my wife!</i>

101
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,379
<i>I'll do what I must to survive</i>
<i>and return to her.</i>

102
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,507
<i>Even if I lose my eyes or nose,</i>
<i>I'm going back alive!</i>

103
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,218
<i>Even if I die, I'm going back alive!</i>

104
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,765
<i>I'll just have to destroy her</i>
<i>faster than she can regenerate.</i>

105
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,897
<i>Impossible… A human can't…</i>

106
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,122
You're probably still not dead,
so answer me.

107
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,290
Where is the elixir?

108
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,796
What should I do?

109
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,552
They'll get mad at me again.

110
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
<i>Stay calm.</i>

111
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,131
<i>It's not the first time</i>
<i>you've faced a monster.</i>

112
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,383
<i>Analyze and deal,</i>

113
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,012
<i>just like always. Then…</i>

114
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,557
Ninja Art: Fire Monk.

115
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
<i>My body…</i>

116
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,481
<i>All it's endured is</i>
<i>finally catching up to me.</i>

117
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,238
<i>Mysterious magic and huge monsters…</i>

118
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,324
<i>Is all this really real?</i>

119
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,328
<i>No… Was anything from</i>
<i>the past few days real?</i>

120
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,998
<i>It's like I'm having a nightmare.</i>

121
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,089
Are you awake?

122
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,261
You were thrashing about.

123
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,888
Did you have a bad dream?

124
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,141
Oh…

125
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,311
I guess…

126
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,397
A dream…

127
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,361
Thank goodness.

128
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,115
You must have had a nightmare.

129
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,868
You've been so busy lately.

130
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,912
Why don't you take today to rest?

131
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,264
Have some chrysanthemum tea.

132
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,725
I've heard it prevents nightmares.

133
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,940
Oh dear… Do you not like chrysanthemum?

134
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,527
It's not that. I'm just really happy.

135
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,946
Even if this is just a dream…

136
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,449
I'm glad I get to talk to you.

137
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,452
What are you talking about?

138
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,623
I'm sorry.

139
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,251
<i>I might not be able</i>
<i>to come home after all.</i>

140
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,395
<i>The Law of the Shinobi, rule number 20.</i>

141
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,357
If you are on the verge of death,

142
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,567
muster the last of your life force

143
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,322
to deal as much damage
as possible before your death.

144
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,491
<i>Well, just memorize it.</i>

145
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,328
<i>I have trained the instinct</i>
<i>into you either way.</i>

146
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,670
<i>If it comes to your death,</i>
<i>aim to make it a draw.</i>

147
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,422
<i>It has nothing to do with desire.</i>

148
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,311
<i>I'm sorry… I might…</i>

149
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,468
Mei… What are you doing?

150
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,272
We can't help what's already been done.

151
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,232
I… I'm so sorry!

152
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,985
I searched for him immediately, but…

153
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,030
<i>The fog got thicker</i>
<i>the farther from the village I got.</i>

154
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,990
<i>Even coming back was a trial…</i>

155
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,744
It is impossible to advance
in a straight line through that fog.

156
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,287
For an ordinary human, anyway.

157
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,706
If Gabimaru was headed
for the Horai region…

158
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,750
We'd better find him soon.

159
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,127
-I don't want to!
-What?

160
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,255
We don't have time for that!

161
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,300
He left all on his own.

162
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,427
He was useful in battle,

163
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,054
but we can't help it if he left.

164
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,682
Besides, why should an Asaemon care

165
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,100
about the safety of a sinner?

166
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,353
There's really no reason to find him.

167
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,270
Ah, well…

168
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,273
If you mean to go to Horai,
I will accompany you.

169
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,318
I cannot find Mei anywhere.

170
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,862
I think she must have followed Gabimaru.

171
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,824
I must go find her, but
I would like some assistance.

172
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,994
So does that mean you can
navigate through the fog?

173
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,412
I can.

174
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,918
Well, then! I too, am-- am--

175
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,546
Worried! I, too, am worried about
Gabimaru! Let's go together, Sagirin!

176
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,799
Very well.

177
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,177
But, enough about going to Horai.

178
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,555
Doesn't Lord Tensen have
some nasty guys around him?

179
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,598
Correct.

180
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,433
What is Lord Tensen?

181
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,435
Tell us more about him!

182
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,523
Miss Yuzuriha,
you'll get lost if you don't focus.

183
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,941
No, I won't!

184
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,610
-Sagirin, you want to know too, right?
-Huh?

185
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,112
About Lord Tensen.

186
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,573
Yes. I do.

187
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,244
If Lord Tensen lives in Horai,

188
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,913
I'm sure we will cross paths eventually.

189
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,624
Lord Tensen is…

190
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,711
The Seven Sennin.

191
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,463
A man is better.

192
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,091
To start with, he has no extra parts.

193
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,843
His beauty is in the simplicity of design.

194
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,262
I much prefer women.

195
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,306
When I see a female body,
I just want to touch it.

196
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,766
Shut up.

197
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,352
Both are beautiful in their own way.

198
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,896
Are we only talking about looks?

199
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,523
I prefer men.

200
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,775
Their condition
and operation are more natural.

201
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,738
What? Last time you agreed with me.

202
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,197
That was based on interest.

203
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,576
Not true! You were so passionate about it.

204
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,997
You're good at handling cranky people.

205
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,790
That's what's great about him!

206
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,667
It's good to be so lively.

207
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,419
Shut up.

208
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,422
Enough chit-chat.

209
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,507
I will begin my regular report.

210
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,429
The humans that arrived
on the island the other day

211
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,890
appear to be different
from those who came before.

212
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,434
They are fewer, but fiercer.

213
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,187
They have killed many Soshin.

214
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,398
Zhu Jin, it's because you've
been slacking on watch!

215
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,277
You allowed the humans we
found at the beach to slip by.

216
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,113
And last night you had a close
battle with another at the gate.

217
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,574
You're pathetic!

218
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,538
What's more, you're in that form.

219
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,332
You used too much Tao.

220
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,875
Oh dear.

221
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,086
You reap what you sow.

222
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,215
I can't believe you were
so cornered you had to use your Kishikai.

223
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,635
That's enough, Ju Fa. We are a family.

224
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,720
Family must be united.

225
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,722
And family must obey.

226
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,682
They must obey me.

227
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,061
I am the only one allowed to harm Zhu Jin.

228
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,481
Fine.

229
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,692
What about the human
you encountered in the forest?

230
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,486
Did you take care of him?

231
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,155
<i>I dropped him half-dead in a hole.</i>

232
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,074
He must be flowers by now.

233
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,118
Don't get cocky.

234
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,204
<i>We have also discovered</i>
<i>a corpse in front of the gate.</i>

235
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>A human who could kill that</i>
<i>should not be underestimated.</i>

236
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,877
Including the human
who cornered Zhu Jin last night…

237
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>Something is different this time.</i>

238
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>If he manages to escape from the hole…</i>

239
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,804
<i>There's reason to fear an injured beast.</i>

240
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:03,058
<i>If the humans who he arrived with</i>
<i>are of similar strength,</i>

241
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,185
<i>we may be in some trouble.</i>

242
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,314
The man who made you use your Kishikai…

243
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,066
You made sure to kill him, right?

244
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,569
Yeah…

245
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,114
Well, whoever comes,

246
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,324
we are of one mind.

247
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,710
To immortal Soshi.

248
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,720
<i>There are actually seven immortals?</i>

249
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,848
It is said that there
was originally only one.

250
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,349
What? What does that mean?

251
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,936
<i>Shangdi Samantabhadra,</i>
<i>Great Emperor Akshobhya,</i>

252
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,106
<i>Enthroned Amoghavajra, Great Sage Ratna,</i>

253
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>Tathata Yuanjun, Decorous Monju Koko,</i>
<i>Imperial Monarch Cundi.</i>

254
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,114
<i>A Sennin climbed</i>
<i>a mountain and became a god,</i>

255
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,074
<i>then split into seven.</i>

256
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,869
<i>They all have</i>
<i>the same appearance and voice.</i>

257
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,246
<i>But their personalities and roles differ.</i>

258
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,665
<i>These seven rule over this island.</i>

259
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,420
That is the limit of what
I have known since I was a child.

260
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,339
When you were a child…

261
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,882
were you a leaf?

262
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,300
No.

263
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,053
I bore the same appearance as you.

264
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,641
<i>All who live in the village</i>
<i>once bore human-like appearances.</i>

265
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,269
<i>We lived longer than you,</i>
<i>and were stronger in our faith.</i>

266
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,897
<i>Our village prospered.</i>

267
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,106
However…

268
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,277
Is this…?

269
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,530
It has been a thousand years
since the village prospered.

270
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,116
Our lives may be long,

271
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,035
but before we die, we arborify.

272
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,286
Arborify?

273
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>Our bodies slowly become trees.</i>

274
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>In the end, we become a single tree</i>

275
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,586
<i>and root down to the ground</i>
<i>in a prayer position.</i>

276
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,547
<i>It progresses regardless of age,</i>

277
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,383
<i>and we lose our consciousness.</i>

278
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,678
<i>Just before losing consciousness,</i>
<i>we come here.</i>

279
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,805
<i>In doing so, we believe</i>

280
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,641
<i>that our soul will then</i>
<i>be invited to Horai.</i>

281
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,395
Very little of my consciousness remains.

282
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,147
I had a family,
but they have all aborified.

283
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,650
This is my daughter.

284
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,154
<i>Unfortunately, she was</i>
<i>the first in my family to arborify.</i>

285
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,994
In that case, even if you do
live for over a thousand years,

286
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,413
the village would still decay.

287
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:33,458
Horai is the goal for the soul,
where it will find rest.

288
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,629
Lord Tensen are the gods
who determines who enters Horai.

289
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,756
We must never disobey them.

290
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>He left without telling anyone…</i>

291
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,887
<i>And his welfare is out of my jurisdiction…</i>

292
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,056
<i>But…</i>

293
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,434
<i>I still hope he's safe.</i>

294
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,313
<i>Where… am I?</i>

295
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,815
<i>Did this girl save me?</i>

296
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,446
<i>The Sennin… They can't possibly be gods.</i>

297
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,323
<i>They are monsters, plain and simple.</i>

298
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>If I want to get the elixir…</i>

299
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,994
<i>I'll have to kill one.</i>

300
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,705
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

301
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,292
<i>If they're monsters and not gods…</i>

302
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,335
<i>That means there's a way to kill them.</i>

303
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>But I can't be reckless.</i>
<i>I'll have to find a way to fight them.</i>

304
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,425
<i>It'll be hard on my own.</i>

305
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,595
<i>I'll need two or three people…</i>
<i>Maybe even more.</i>

306
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,892
I thought a pile of dirty rags was moving,

307
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,269
but it's just that ninja from before.

308
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,522
You look like hell. Someone do you in?

309
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,948
