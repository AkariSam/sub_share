1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,575
<i>The blade pierces, the guts spill out,</i>

2
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,078
<i>but they heal in a moment.</i>

3
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>The chief of Iwagakure</i>
<i>was truly an immortal,</i>

4
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>thanks to a medicine he obtained long ago</i>

5
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,546
<i>on a continent beyond the sea.</i>

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,346
Your face…

7
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,892
You didn't think
it really existed, did you?

8
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,435
Do you mean…?

9
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,104
It does exist. The elixir of immortality,

10
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,315
or the Tokijiku no Kagu no mi.

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>I don't know if it's here, but…</i>

12
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,713
This is…

13
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,302
Everything is so mystical.

14
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,013
I wouldn't be surprised

15
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,558
if the elixir of immortality was here.

16
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,270
You mean the scenery is eerie.

17
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,650
<i>All the plants here are</i>
<i>different in species and habitat.</i>

18
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,277
<i>It's just unnatural.</i>

19
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,737
Besides…

20
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,032
You never know what's out there.

21
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,533
We need to be on the lookout.

22
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,535
The hand ropes shall not be removed!

23
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,788
Eh. How can I do anything if I'm tied up?

24
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,041
Rules are rules.

25
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,585
It's my job to watch over the criminals.

26
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,546
If you break the rules,
I can't overlook it.

27
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,590
Put your hand rope back on.

28
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,843
Come on, give me a break.

29
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,803
This isn't the only reckless thing either.

30
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,306
We only have
water and food for three days.

31
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,558
And only one clue.

32
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,686
They have no intention
of finding it, do they?

33
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,482
Put your rope back on.

34
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,526
Let me make it clear.

35
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,572
I'm an executioner, not a collaborator.

36
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,202
If you fail to find the elixir
and don't receive your full pardon,

37
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,579
it is none of my business.

38
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,333
If you don't put the rope on,
I'll cut off your head.

39
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,466
Fine then. Have it your way.

40
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,219
I just want to see my wife.

41
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,265
I'll accept your terms for that,
but don't ask for too--

42
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,280
The first one is down.

43
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,657
You fool!

44
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,788
To be careless in such a situation,

45
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,291
you deserve to die.

46
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,544
That surprised me.

47
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,714
Are you okay?

48
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,425
Yeah, I just dislocated my neck.

49
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,677
-Who is he anyway?
-Um…

50
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,723
He's a criminal on death row,
the Warped Keiun.

51
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,684
<i>During his training as a monk-soldier,</i>

52
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,687
<i>he became fascinated by the armor itself.</i>

53
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>He's collected more than 100 pieces</i>
<i>of armor from martial artists.</i>

54
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,695
No, what I want to know is…

55
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,572
Why is he not tied?

56
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,619
No, that's not important now…
No, what I mean is…

57
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,581
Sir, why is he not tied?

58
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,375
You're too serious
about everything, Sagiri.

59
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,128
Just tie them up on the way back.

60
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,214
I can't be bothered by a bunch of idiots
over something like that.

61
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,550
See, I told you so.

62
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,304
It's because of your foolish honesty
that you're still below me.

63
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,476
We, the Asaemon are ranked.
By the way, Sagiri is…

64
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,520
Now is not the time to talk about that…

65
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,025
Are you ignoring me, Gabimaru the Hollow?

66
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,279
You are as bold and sturdy
as you are rumored to be.

67
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,156
This is the perfect opportunity.

68
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,160
I can now fully test my masterpiece!

69
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,164
Armor shines only when it sucks blood…

70
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:19,295
I will teach its beauty to you.

71
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,339
Are you a pervert?

72
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,716
If we fight here now,

73
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,802
the other guys will get ahead of us.

74
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,762
Let it be.

75
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,431
We have no clues to begin with anyway.

76
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,185
So, first, I'll kill all the criminals.

77
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,064
Then I'll slowly search for the elixir.

78
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:43,528
-You are the first to die, Hollow.
-Seriously?

79
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,863
We're just here to keep an eye on you.

80
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,448
If you want to kill, be my guest.

81
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,200
I agree.

82
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,912
What a pain in the ass
and a waste of time.

83
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,665
I don't want to do this
because it would make my wife sad.

84
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,960
I have no choice, but to kill you.

85
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,211
Show me what you got.

86
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,466
-Your rope.
-You're kidding, right?

87
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,481
Alright, I got it tied.

88
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,317
This is my chance.

89
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,987
Now, I can test all of my weapons on you!

90
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,281
I don't have the time for that.

91
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,664
<i>He threw that huge body</i>
<i>with just a single stick.</i>

92
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,124
<i>He threw him.</i>

93
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,266
This is hard to do,
especially with hand ropes.

94
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,019
<i>He struck him with a blow?</i>

95
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,526
<i>The armor is directly sewn onto his skin.</i>

96
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,779
<i>He's out of the ordinary after all.</i>

97
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,782
Come on, let the game begin.

98
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,784
Gabimaru the…

99
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,590
I wasted a lot of time.

100
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,635
Let's look for the elixir.

101
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,680
I've got my hand ropes on.

102
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,308
Ah… yes.

103
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,445
Well, I'll be leaving.

104
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,822
You sure you don't want to fight?

105
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,118
I told you, we are neither friend nor foe.

106
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,870
When the criminal we're in charge of dies,

107
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,248
we bring back its head. That's all.

108
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,750
I'm gonna go home and take a bath.

109
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,960
Sir,

110
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,921
60 people are missing on this island.

111
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,339
Please be careful on your way home.

112
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,552
You should be worrying about yourself.

113
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,221
I'm lucky to get out of here so fast.

114
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,809
If you're relieved just because he's tied,
you're too naive.

115
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,478
You're standing next to a criminal.

116
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,439
<i>It's been a few hours since landing,</i>

117
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,483
<i>but, I've already seen it.</i>

118
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,405
<i>There are those who try to eliminate their</i>
<i>opponent before landing.</i>

119
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,657
<i>Those who plan to collude.</i>

120
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,909
<i>And those who pretend to do so.</i>

121
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,789
<i>Those who can't follow</i>
<i>the rules of society in the first place.</i>

122
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,793
<i>Those who don't care about</i>
<i>their roles or rules.</i>

123
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,677
<i>Each try to survive in their own way.</i>

124
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,554
<i>They'll do whatever it takes.</i>

125
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:01,642
But, if they break the rules… isn't
the letter of official release invalid?

126
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,436
You're so serious about everything.

127
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,439
For a samurai,
the lord's wishes are absolute,

128
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,233
but what matters now is priority.

129
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,695
Our priority now is the elixir.
Everything else comes second.

130
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,740
It's better to break the rules

131
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,117
than to follow them and find nothing.

132
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,869
The Government would be more pleased.

133
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,955
Rules are only valid

134
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,292
if everyone follows them.

135
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,961
Some people don't follow the rules at all.

136
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,588
Just like that guy.

137
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,342
Maybe I'll… I'll slay you right now.

138
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:40,097
Stop wasting your time.
I don't have time for this.

139
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,768
I just want to go home to my wife.

140
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,353
I don't care about anything else.

141
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,982
Let's get going.

142
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,528
You're right, you better hurry.

143
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,573
<i>I'll tell you what's gonna happen.</i>

144
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,369
<i>In a few more hours,</i>
<i>things are going to change.</i>

145
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,380
Hungry, Rokurota?

146
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,780
<i>In a few hours,</i>
<i>the situation will be unpredictable.</i>

147
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,537
<i>More than half will be dead,</i>

148
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,164
<i>and in another few hours, the other half.</i>

149
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,879
<i>In less than a day, you will be alone.</i>

150
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,342
<i>You're all expendable after all.</i>

151
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,636
<i>When we run out,</i>
<i>we'll just add the next one.</i>

152
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,097
The next one?

153
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,058
I heard that Hattori's messenger
flew to Ishu.

154
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,854
There's no mistake that the Government
has made contact with the new Iwagakure.

155
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,816
Asaemon is not a monolith, Sagiri.

156
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,984
It is rumored

157
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,777
that the next head of the
Government will be decided by this role.

158
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,281
I don't know if it's true or not, but…

159
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,117
If so,
you'll be against those with ambition.

160
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,785
Not that I'm interested.

161
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,287
See you later.

162
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,289
Don't let your guard down
when dealing with sinners.

163
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,374
I've warned you.

164
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,420
<i>It's true…</i>

165
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,423
<i>Even after watching him for a few days,</i>

166
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,426
<i>I still can't grasp</i>
<i>this man's true nature.</i>

167
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,052
<i>But…</i>

168
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,388
So… where shall we go?

169
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,772
What are you doing?!

170
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,152
I thought I'd kill you
without causing you pain.

171
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,653
<i>As I thought…</i>

172
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,947
<i>This man's true nature is…</i>

173
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:15,294
As soon as he has a child,
he wants to leave the village?

174
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,089
It is shameful, even for a jonin.

175
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,134
I will raise this child.

176
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,219
Yes, sir.

177
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,554
Take a good look, Gabimaru.

178
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,474
This is weakness.

179
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,435
If you have feelings for someone,
even if it's a parent and child,

180
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,522
that in itself weakens you.

181
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,274
If you are not strong,
you cannot protect anything.

182
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,945
<i>Anything that is important…</i>

183
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,302
If you kill me,
you will be breaking the rules.

184
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,431
Didn't your friend say that
priority is key?

185
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,143
<i>If the Iwagakure land on the island,</i>

186
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,229
<i>everything will come crashing down.</i>

187
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,691
<i>We must find the elixir</i>
<i>before that happens.</i>

188
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,945
I hold no grudge against you,
but you're a nuisance.

189
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,072
So that's why… you're going to kill me?

190
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,575
When you have no choice,
you have no choice.

191
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,201
Sorry, but you're gonna die.

192
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,582
<i>This man is dangerous after all.</i>

193
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,167
<i>His thoughts and ethics are</i>
<i>extreme and abnormal.</i>

194
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,545
<i>He should be executed immediately!</i>

195
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,799
<i>And yet… I'm hesitant about it.</i>

196
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,012
<i>I can't… I just can't….</i>

197
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,603
<i>Again… She could have</i>
<i>killed me now, but she didn't.</i>

198
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,651
<i>Why am I hesitating?</i>

199
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,403
<i>Why?</i>

200
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,408
Not wanting to kill
is a natural thing, isn't it?

201
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,163
But I am Hollow.

202
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,582
How can I have such feelings?

203
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,712
What are you saying? You're a man
who blushes after a mere kiss.

204
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,343
If you have feelings, follow them.

205
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,888
You're no longer the same person
you once were.

206
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,936
To be true to one's feelings
is true courage.

207
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,648
I will follow you.

208
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,442
Even if I have to leave my village.

209
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,113
<i>Meeting my wife, I learned to love.</i>

210
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,452
<i>But… I also learned to hate.</i>

211
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,163
That man is not our target.

212
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,292
He said he would take revenge
on me and my wife so…

213
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,548
Please wait! I can't die!

214
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,217
I have a wife and child!

215
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,857
<i>I learned weakness as well.</i>

216
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,579
<i>Again… This is weakness.</i>

217
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,748
<i>If I don't do this, I won't be acquitted,</i>

218
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,334
<i>let alone survive here.</i>

219
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,839
<i>I'm dealing with a ferocious criminal.</i>

220
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,925
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>my life is in danger, yet….</i>

221
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,599
<i>What a nuisance… the heart is.</i>

222
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,729
If you're not strong,
you can't protect anything.

223
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,872
Don't waste your time resisting.

224
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,291
You know what you're capable of.

225
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,252
You can't kill me with that.

226
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,006
I wouldn't feel this way killing sinners,

227
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,383
but it pains me to kill you.

228
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,303
So please die peacefully.

229
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,431
It pains you?
You have such feelings in your heart?

230
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,560
I guess…

231
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,488
I have no heart.

232
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,491
I am Gabimaru the Hollow.

233
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,827
I've killed more people than I can count.

234
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,122
Killing you won't make a difference.

235
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,582
I won't feel a thing.

236
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,667
That's how I was raised.

237
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,797
If you're not strong,
you can't protect anything.

238
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,343
<i>This man is dangerous after all…</i>

239
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,095
I don't want your mercy.

240
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,930
Please die.

241
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,224
<i>And yet…</i>

242
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,740
<i>Why…?</i>

243
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,743
<i>Why do I hesitate?</i>

244
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,830
<i>Shouldn't I feel nothing?</i>

245
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,624
<i>I just realized…</i>

246
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,253
<i>That time… And that time too.</i>

247
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,547
<i>This man has always…</i>

248
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,049
<i>had that same look on his face.</i>

249
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,052
<i>Those eyes,</i>
<i>as if they are enduring something.</i>

250
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,515
<i>The environment in which he was born</i>
<i>and raised in makes him do this.</i>

251
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,809
<i>He is not a hollow man</i>
<i>that doesn't feel anything.</i>

252
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,812
<i>He's a man with feelings.</i>

253
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,315
<i>I was also able to… face my true feelings</i>

254
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,569
<i>because of him.</i>

255
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,029
Have I…

256
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,949
become this weak?

257
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,452
I can't survive like this…

258
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,124
I'll never see my wife, if I'm this weak.

259
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,544
That is not weakness.

260
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,338
It's a kind of strength.

261
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,633
Believing you don't feel anything

262
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,636
is the same as looking away.

263
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,972
I believe that true strength is to

264
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,432
not run away from your feelings.

265
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,603
<i>To be true to one's feelings</i>
<i>is true courage.</i>

266
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,356
Let me just say this.

267
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,944
Because of you,
I've been able to face my feelings.

268
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,615
How can you say that in this situation?

269
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,284
You're the one who's holding back.

270
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,662
I should give you the death penalty, but…

271
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,831
this time I'll overlook it.

272
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,044
If you truly repent your sins,
face your true self,

273
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,214
and you're struggling
to reclaim your life.

274
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,759
I want to see you do it.

275
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,639
Please show me.

276
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,143
Whether a man like you
can get his life back.

277
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,065
<i>I have to face myself too,</i>

278
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,276
<i>to become stronger.</i>

279
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,780
Our position won't change.

280
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,032
But you are…

281
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,034
<i>You are no longer…</i>

282
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,996
the same person you once were.

283
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,760
What is this?

284
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,978
They look like… man-made objects.

285
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,498
What the hell are you doing?

286
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,211
-Why did you do that?
-Look!

287
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,047
It's a butterfly with a human face.

288
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,050
How can such things exist?

289
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,307
-Amazing!
-This is no time to be fascinated.

290
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,398
What in the world is this island?

291
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,275
Is this place really a paradise?

292
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:02,738
Biologically, it may be possible but…

293
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,741
This is getting interesting.

294
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,506
Interesting…

295
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,644
What is this… creature?

296
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,565
Stand back.

297
