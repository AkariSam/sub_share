1
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:07,750
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

2
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,750
ROYAL MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENT

3
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:37,375
(Episode 5: With Your Majesty!)
Opponent is a member of the Kingdom's Knights

4
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,458
Leo.

5
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,500
D GROUP, SECOND MATCH

6
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:48,625
That guy named Leo is really strong,

7
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,000
he's way more powerful than the others.

8
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:52,958
Of course.

9
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,792
With this momentum,
you'll definitely win the championship.

10
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:56,958
We're counting on you, Leo.

11
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,458
Only you are worthy to be a hero.

12
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,292
He just got lucky, I guess.

13
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,292
He's got some skills.

14
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:19,625
Even you might…

15
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,458
Are you going out?

16
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,667
I should go for a walk
since I have been staying home.

17
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,292
What are you doing?

18
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,750
Actually…

19
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,500
I want to go with you too.

20
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,667
Where are we going?

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,750
I was just planning on walking around
and then going home,

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,292
I don't have a specific place in mind.

23
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,375
Then let's go shopping for clothes.

24
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,500
What do you think of this outfit?

25
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,875
Is this outfit suitable for me?
What do you think?

26
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:06,917
Not bad.

27
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,000
But…

28
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,042
I want to find something that
enhances my majesty even more.

29
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,583
How about this one then?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,792
That's fine, just buy that one.

31
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,458
Will I look good wearing this?

32
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,042
Are you done yet…

33
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,542
By the way…

34
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,750
You're a guy, right?

35
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,458
It doesn't really matter

36
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,125
if I'm a guy or a girl.

37
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:38,167
If you have time,
would you like to try it on?

38
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,458
No need for formalities,
please show me the way.

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,375
Don't talk to the salesperson
in that tone of voice.

40
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,625
Oh right,

41
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,750
we need to buy some
children's clothes too.

42
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,750
I see, that's great news.

43
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,750
It's not like that, we just…

44
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:57,125
You made the salesperson misunderstand,
just stop talking.

45
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,750
I'm exhausted.

46
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,417
You're so pathetic,
can you even be called a hero?

47
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,542
Max, keep it up.

48
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,083
We can go home today
after we take down this place.

49
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,583
What do you want to eat?
I'll cook anything for you.

50
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:17,833
Let me think…

51
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:22,500
Please try our delicious mini sausages,
they're really tasty.

52
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,667
Bouncy and juicy. Let's buy some.

53
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,417
Thank you for your patronage.
Oh my, could you be…

54
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,125
You're Mr. Max, right?

55
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,333
Uh, yes.

56
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:40,417
-Wow, what a coincidence.
-You're recognized again. Great.

57
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,375
-Wow, what a coincidence.
-Shut up.

58
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,583
Is this your girlfriend?
She's so beautiful.

59
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,833
You're too kind.

60
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,500
Could I shake your hand, Mr. Hero?

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,667
No one calls me a hero anymore.

62
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:59,292
I never thought I'd run into you
in a place like this.

63
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,667
It's an unexpected gain.

64
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,458
You are…

65
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:09,375
I was just thinking
your hands are quite rough.

66
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,208
You're as rude as ever
when it comes to women.

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,542
I was just about to take a break.

68
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,292
Would you like to join me
downstairs for a chat?

69
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,750
What if I refuse?

70
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:24,125
Neither of us wants to
make a scene, right?

71
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,792
I'm afraid your girlfriend
will have to wait.

72
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,000
Max.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,042
Just pretend to be a normal girl for now.

74
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:35,417
I need to talk to her about something,
you go back first.

75
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,667
What's going on?

76
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,500
Who is this woman anyway?

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
THE TRUE FACE OF THE REPUBLIC GAMMA IS TEAR-JERKING
I'M A TERRORIST. NO WAY

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,708
She's Leo's subordinate.

79
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,625
She's probably a member of
the Republic Gamma now.

80
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,167
Wait, Max. Who is that woman?

81
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,667
Stop right there.

82
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:58,125
That girlfriend seems way better
than the previous ones.

83
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,458
She's not my girlfriend.

84
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,125
But is it okay?

85
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,875
That girl seems quite young.

86
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,250
I was about to ask you the same thing.

87
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,417
What are you doing in a place like this?

88
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,917
Well…

89
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,042
Spying, I guess?

90
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,375
Is she Leo's subordinate?
That's very concerning.

91
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,542
Although he told me to go home first…

92
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,083
I'd better check the situation.

93
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,917
Will he encounter any danger?

94
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:33,333
Or is he doing something else dangerous?

95
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,750
Un-Unforgivable.

96
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,625
Sorry.

97
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,125
You are Max's companion, right?

98
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,500
Yes.

99
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,583
I'll take you to Max. Follow me.

100
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,750
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

101
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,958
But you might never see Max again.

102
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,917
Will you lead the way for me? Thank you.

103
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,208
Carry this for me.

104
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,708
Here you go.

105
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,250
When did we last meet?

106
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,958
Let me think.

107
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:12,542
It was two years before your rebellion.
So almost five years.

108
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,042
Yeah, you look older, Max.

109
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,667
You see, I haven't aged at all.

110
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:21,125
After all, I exercise regularly,
and my hands have become rough.

111
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,000
Is the captain doing well?

112
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,250
He's still as energetic as ever.

113
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,833
You really do care.

114
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,792
Captain Leo also thinks of you often.

115
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,125
He sometimes says,

116
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,292
"I wonder if Max is doing well.
I wonder what he's doing now."

117
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,208
I'm just living the way you see me now.

118
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
You're from the Republic Gamma, right?

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,208
Yes.

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,125
So you're a terrorist, huh? How scary.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,958
We're not terrorists.

122
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,208
Listen, it's all the kingdom's fault.

123
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,833
You're going to break the egg like that.

124
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:06,417
Do you know how the captain feels
being exiled to that barren land?

125
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,500
Do you know how much effort we put in
to develop that land?

126
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,625
But as soon as they found magic ore there,
those guys just…

127
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,333
Sorry, don't be rude to me.

128
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,792
So you want Max to join you in your battle
against the kingdom?

129
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,708
You think we're stupid, don't you?

130
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,958
What is the point of having
another retired old man,

131
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,875
whether he defeated Demon Lord or not?

132
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,500
But everyone is clamoring to find Max.

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,458
I just have to help reluctantly.

134
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,042
In my own way.

135
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,333
What?

136
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,708
What's with the swagger, you idiot?

137
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,292
If you were to face off against Max,
you'd be knocked out in two seconds.

138
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,708
That is something to be excited about.

139
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,875
Oh, Fred invited you, huh?

140
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,250
How did you respond?

141
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,083
I rejected it. I don't want to
get involved in trouble.

142
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,208
Great.

143
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:08,875
So, do you want to get me
involved in trouble too?

144
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,833
I am on the fence about it.

145
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,417
I have something for you.

146
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,792
REPUBLIC GAMMA
This is a ship ticket to the Republic Gamma.

147
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,417
It stops at Tratigo on the way.

148
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,792
With this ticket, even people from
the kingdom can safely reach there.

149
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,875
You really didn't bring me anything good.
Tratigo, huh?

150
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,042
The people there are cunning too, right?

151
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,375
Yes.

152
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,417
But they are our important
business partners.

153
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,875
To be honest, I really hope
you can join us.

154
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,792
If you're willing, come visit us.

155
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,958
The captain will be very happy.

156
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,167
I'll think about it.

157
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,500
Big sister, you're too naive.

158
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,250
Giving him that kind of
thing is pointless.

159
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,458
Do you want to watch helplessly
as the hero we finally found leaves us?

160
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,583
Will.

161
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,083
Max, save me.

162
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,042
This guy is scary.

163
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,792
What are you doing, Will?

164
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,667
Let the girl go immediately.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,833
-Save me
-Sister, sometimes we need to be tough.

166
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,250
-Save me…
-Do you think he'll come with just that piece of paper?

167
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,917
See, all we have to do is this
and he'll have to give in.

168
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,958
You know.

169
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,750
Isn't it terroristic to take hostages

170
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,750
to force someone to do something?

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you want to embarrass the captain?

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,542
Yeah, Big Sister is right.

173
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,875
Don't call me Big Sister.

174
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:42,083
In the kingdom, you can only get distorted

175
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,500
and false information about
the Republic Gamma.

176
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,292
I kindly invite you
and your girlfriend to visit.

177
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,083
You'll definitely like it.

178
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,792
It's better than this corrupt country.

179
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,958
My girlfriend?

180
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,750
Where is this girlfriend of mine
you mentioned?

181
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,458
I don't see her.

182
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:01,833
Max, don't you care about
my life and death?

183
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,583
Save me, you fool! Useless,
you sponge off women.

184
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,542
-So you sponge off women, huh?
-Sponge off women…useless.

185
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,750
I've always wanted to chat with
the hero face-to-face.

186
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,208
Absolutely disappointed.

187
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,667
Your girlfriend was captured, and you
don't even have the courage to fight.

188
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,292
Taking him to see the captain
will only disappoint the captain.

189
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,083
Will, stop it.

190
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:25,000
That's right. There's no point in
having an old man like me join.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,625
Waste of my time.

192
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,250
Even if you refuse,

193
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,875
now that you know of our existence,
we can't just let you go easily.

194
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,583
Ridiculous.

195
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,583
You guys approached me first.

196
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,542
Have you had enough?
Shut up and come with us.

197
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:39,417
-Or else…
-Ouch!

198
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,958
That's better, isn't it?

199
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,750
If I resist, my true identity
might be exposed.

200
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,958
It's more disadvantageous for you.

201
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,917
After all, don't let him
catch you so easily. Fool.

202
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,125
I'm truly sorry, Max.

203
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,708
He was just a kid ten years ago.

204
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,792
He doesn't fully understand
your achievements.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,625
I also want to apologize for scaring you.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,083
He's really rude, isn't he?

207
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,625
He doesn't know how formidable Max is.
How outdated!

208
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:29,875
Will.

209
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,250
I was wrong. I'm very sorry, Mr. Max.

210
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,375
It's good that you know to reflect.

211
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,333
Don't cause trouble for Leo.

212
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,292
Alright.

213
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,167
We're going back to the Republic.

214
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,833
We were planning to retreat anyway.

215
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,792
Besides, I might report you guys to Fred.

216
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,667
That's what I'm saying.

217
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,958
So we need to leave quickly before that.

218
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,125
Take care.

219
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,292
Thanks.

220
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,750
Goodbye.

221
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,833
Unbelievable.

222
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,708
It's rare that we go out shopping
and they dare to interrupt us.

223
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,125
I'm exhausted.

224
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:14,292
Don't you want to join the Republic Gamma?

225
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,250
Not at all. Spare me.

226
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,333
If you want to go to the Republic,

227
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,417
I can go with you.

228
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,542
We can overthrow the corrupt system,

229
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,875
and build a new country with Leo.

230
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,042
That's quite the hero-like thing to do.

231
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,250
In that case, we'll have to
wage war against Fred.

232
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,208
It's fine. Let's get back quickly.

233
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,042
Are your hands okay? We're almost there.

234
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,375
Sorry, Big Sister.

235
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,708
Seahorse.

236
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,500
Joe.

237
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,542
Big Sister, long time no see.

238
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,208
Will is here too.

239
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,542
We're back.

240
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,625
Is Captain Leo on the ship?

241
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,583
No, he's not here right now.

242
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,833
Not here right now?

243
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,875
Perfect timing. Look.

244
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,750
Awesome!

245
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,542
Captain.

246
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:25,333
He's still as reckless as ever.

247
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:26,875
Both of you,

248
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,625
just in time. Get ready for dinner.

249
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,167
TRATIGO, REPUBLIC GAMMA

250
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,083
Is this the ticket that woman gave you?
A ship ticket to the Gamma Republic?

251
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,125
Why did you take a picture?

252
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:41,375
Because you can't buy this in the kingdom.

253
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,542
AIRSHIP TICKET
Because you can't buy this in the kingdom.

254
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,708
I'm going to sell it online.

255
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,750
You're too poor, aren't you?

256
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,167
Do you have a problem with that?

257
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,250
This is my ticket.
How I use it is my freedom.

258
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,458
You got a ticket, don't you want
to see the Republic?

259
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,667
Come on.

260
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:01,125
It's a well-known terrorist territory.

261
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,583
It's dangerous as hell.
Who wants to go there?

262
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,458
You might never return.

263
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,000
It's even more dangerous
to resell tickets to such a place.

264
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,375
Right.

265
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,625
Teleportal.

266
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,375
It seems my power has
recovered quite a bit.

267
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,833
I've set the return point for the
teleportation spell inside this closet.

268
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,583
If something happens on our journey,
we can return here.

269
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,208
Don't set up weird stuff in my closet!

270
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,167
Are you looking for me?

271
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:40,458
Zenia, we'll be out for about two days.

272
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,000
During this time, please take care
of things for us…

273
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,583
Alright, I got it. Leave it to me.

274
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,583
I didn't say I was going.

275
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,167
Can't you go by yourself, Your Majesty?

276
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,667
Max,

277
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,542
why don't you understand my feelings?

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,375
Don't you want to go out
and have fun with me?

279
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,625
No, I just…

280
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,750
You finally woke up, Max.

281
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,500
You have nowhere to run now.

282
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,667
Damn it, I've been tricked.

283
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,292
Was it necessary to go this far?

284
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,542
You could have easily deflected

285
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,958
a deception spell of that level
ten years ago.

286
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,542
Seems like you've become
complacent in peace.

287
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,333
I'm going to take revenge.

288
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,792
Max, there's one more thing.

289
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:37,625
This time, we're on
a reconnaissance mission.

290
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,375
To plan for the future,

291
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,292
we must understand the situation
in the Republic Gamma.

292
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,375
We're not going there for fun, understand?

293
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,917
You say that, but you're dressed
in a full travel outfit.

294
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,542
Max, look.

295
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,167
The vast ocean before us.

296
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,458
The airship is amazing.

297
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,125
BESKER KINGDOM, SERGENDINE
TRATIGO, TRATIGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

298
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:58,667
REPUBLIC GAMMA

299
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,333
We're approaching the Republic Gamma.

300
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,708
Passengers on the deck,
please return to the cabin.

301
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,500
With the exception of that woman,
many of Leo's subordinates recognize me.

302
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,042
If they see us, we'll be in trouble.

303
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,625
Don't worry, I never make mistakes.

304
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,750
Wear this.

305
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,875
Not bad, it suits you. Super cool.

306
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,500
Do you want me to put you back to sleep
for another ten years?

307
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,542
WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC GAMMA

308
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,333
Look, there's smoke over there.

309
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,375
Could it be a conflict?

310
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,292
No, it seems to be a hot spring.

311
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,125
There's a hot spring flowing
through this street.

312
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:44,458
In my hometown,
there are places where lava flows.

313
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,833
It's nostalgic.

314
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,750
Hi, you two…

315
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,667
Welcome to try the hot spring buns.

316
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,958
Give it a try, go ahead and eat.

317
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,875
Delicious.

318
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,458
Here, eat more. More, more.

319
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,708
Here, have some tea.

320
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:03,542
It's hot.

321
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,875
Damn old lady.

322
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,250
This is a nice place.

323
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,500
It doesn't look like
a terrorist country at all.

324
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,917
At the very least, a tourist stop
should be well-presented.

325
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:20,625
This means they have the means to
raise so much funding.

326
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:25,083
Do you really think the
Republic Gamma is an evil force?

327
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,917
It's not about good or evil.

328
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,958
No matter what the inside story is,

329
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,417
the very existence of this place
is enough to cause disputes.

330
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:36,958
For the people of the kingdom, this place
only brings them trouble, that's all.

331
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,250
You talking about serious issues with
that expression makes it even funnier.

332
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,833
What do you think?

333
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,458
Me?

334
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:48,833
Why should you, a demon, interfere in
the petty disputes among humans?

335
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,375
I…

336
00:18:54,708 --> 00:19:00,583
I am just waiting for you humans to
screw up and exploit the situation.

337
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,000
This is also to allow our fellow demons
to invade the human realm again.

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,042
If you could join Leo or Fred and fight
each other, that would be even better.

339
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,708
I'm sorry I can't meet your expectations,
Your Majesty.

340
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,792
It's starting…

341
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,792
Is that Captain Leo?

342
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,667
What, Leo's here?

343
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,167
With so many people gathered,
what's he going to do?

344
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,875
He will probably give a speech
from up high.

345
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,417
Alright, let's go.

346
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,958
Yay!

347
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,500
Come on, come on!

348
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,167
What's he doing?

349
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,250
Don't ask me.

350
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,250
That's called "mixing the soup."

351
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,167
Old lady.

352
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,833
Because the hot springs are too hot
to bathe in directly,

353
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:45,833
GAMMA
but adding water to the hot springs will dilute the components.

354
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,833
GAMMA
So you have to mix it like that

355
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,208
GAMMA
to bring the temperature of the hot springs down to a suitable level.

356
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,167
I see.

357
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:56,208
But that man seems to enjoy
the hot springs before they cool down.

358
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,667
So hot.

359
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,458
That's the heroic figure of the leader
of the Republic Gamma.

360
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,167
It looks like he's just playing.

361
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,875
Alright, this should be about right.

362
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,000
Everyone!

363
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,500
Thank you very much!
Enjoy the hot springs!

364
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,083
He's quite spirited, that's great.

365
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Yeah.

366
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,042
He's still the same.

367
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,750
It's not surprising who wins.

368
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah, this battle is bound to be exciting.

369
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,417
Do you really understand the meaning
of this martial arts tournament?

370
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,500
I do.

371
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,333
Can you fight the demons
with a determination to die?

372
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,250
I can.

373
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,292
Begin.

374
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,583
Come on, Leo.

375
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,208
Defeat that outsider.

376
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:31,167
Leo.
