1
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:04,125
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:06,208
here is what you requested.

3
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:08,667
Thank you, Zenia.

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,917
As long as this plan goes as planned,

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:13,583
the demon's dominance over the human realm

6
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,708
DEMON'S FAMILY: THE BEAUTIES
the demon's dominance over the human realm

7
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:16,958
DEMON'S FAMILY: THE BEAUTIES
will advance significantly.

8
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,500
will advance significantly.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,958
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

10
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:22,292
(Episode 4: A New Challenge for the Hero)
Look.

11
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:23,833
(Episode 4: A New Challenge for the Hero)
Be happy, Hero.

12
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,167
I bring you good news.

13
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,958
What is this? Let me see.

14
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,583
Demon's Family: The Beauties
Portraits Collection.

15
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,667
I give it to you generously out of
sympathy for you, you poor thing.

16
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,875
Aren't you thankful for me?

17
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,458
What exactly are you talking about?

18
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,667
You used to be very popular
with the ladies.

19
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:42,167
But now you can't even find a girlfriend.

20
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,417
You don't have any female friends, do you?

21
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:44,542
I am the female…

22
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,708
What? I don't need a girlfriend.

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,708
Don't give me that.

24
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,500
Despite what you say, I get the impression
that you are pretty lonely.

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
DEMON'S FAMILY: THE BEAUTIES PORTRAITS COLLECTION
This is a collection of photos and personal information

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,750
DEMON'S FAMILY: THE BEAUTIES PORTRAITS COLLECTION
about beautiful women from among my subordinates.

27
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,125
I asked Zenia to make it.

28
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:04,250
I can assist you in matching up
with a girl you like.

29
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,833
How could I possibly fall in love
with a demon?

30
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:09,458
Why not?

31
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:14,042
Come on. After all, I am a man who
killed countless demons ten years ago.

32
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:15,875
Wouldn't they mind?

33
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,417
It's not a big deal.

34
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:19,208
You don't have to worry.

35
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:23,333
I have already said that we demons
have seven lives.

36
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,500
We don't particularly care
about our own lives and deaths.

37
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,167
That's not the point.

38
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,750
Anyway, take a look at them first.

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,000
Each of them is a good and versatile girl.

40
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:42,875
NAME: ZENIA, JOB: SECRETARY

41
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,667
Why is it her as soon as I open it?

42
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,083
It seems that
Zenia is also a bit interested.

43
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:53,458
Did she take these pictures herself?

44
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,875
What is she thinking?

45
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,417
She must be making a pass at you.

46
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,583
Take a good look.

47
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:04,500
I don't need a woman who chases me
naked when she is drunk.

48
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,958
She is a decent girl
when she doesn't drink.

49
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,792
I highly doubt if a decent person
would dress like that.

50
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,917
Alright, take a look at the other girls.

51
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:18,000
Take your pick.
You are so enviable, you brat.

52
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,458
NAME: REBECCA
JOB: CAPTAIN OF THE BEAST DEMON CORPS' SIXTH SQUAD

53
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,000
Isn't this a pig?

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,292
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:26,250
Rebecca is a Half-Orc swordswoman
and Beast Demon Corps elite.

56
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,375
How can you call her a pig?

57
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,500
Because she is a pig, a real pig.

58
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,708
Rebecca is truly a nice girl.

59
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,458
Her hands are very skillful, too.

60
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,333
Look carefully.

61
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,667
Her favorite armor is also
handcrafted by her.

62
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,250
Her femininity is
quite amazing, isn't it?

63
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,333
She is so talented.

64
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,500
No, the fact that she made her own armor
goes far beyond the bounds of femininity.

65
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,542
This person seems quite normal.

66
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,667
NAME: DESDALE
Desdale, huh? You have good taste.

67
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:54,458
JOB: FIRST-CLASS SOLDIER IN THE MAGIC CORPS
She is an intelligent and proficient magic warrior.

68
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,625
Her temperament is a little slothful,
but some find it endearing.

69
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:06,083
In hand-to-hand combat, she entwines
her opponent with her lower body.

70
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,125
Why aren't there any normal ones? Damn it.

71
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,167
Don't judge her by her appearance.
I remember her hobby being sports.

72
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,458
A girl who loves sports
is charming, isn't she?

73
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,042
That's not the point.
The point is why she's a snake.

74
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,875
Wouldn't it be great if she were human?

75
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,792
What about this girl?

76
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,625
NAME: YVON, JOB: SERVICE STAFF
From head to toe, she's human.

77
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,917
NAME: YVON, JOB: SERVICE STAFF
You should say she used to be" human."

78
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,958
Don't call this dead person a human.

79
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,208
Aren't you being too picky?

80
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,833
Darn it.

81
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,833
Look, there are so many options.

82
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,083
You'll definitely find a woman
that suits your preferences.

83
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,750
I remember this giant dragon and squid.

84
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,583
After all, they're incredibly strong.

85
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,750
So, they are actually female.

86
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,792
What do you expect me to do
when you introduce them to me?

87
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,917
So, which girl do you like?

88
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,625
Nobody, idiot.

89
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,375
Isn't this just a demon encyclopedia?

90
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,625
Geez, your standards are so high.

91
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,625
Tell me about the type of girl you prefer.

92
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,125
Although telling you probably won't help,

93
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,500
the essential condition is that
she looks like a human.

94
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,292
You mean having hands and legs
and moving on two feet?

95
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,208
Yes, that's right.

96
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,917
How about a detachable head?

97
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,083
Absolutely not, idiot.

98
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,917
In that case, Zenia seems like
a good candidate.

99
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,250
I don't like silly girls like her.

100
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:23,375
It's better if she's a bit smarter.

101
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,708
What else?

102
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,583
A decisive and forthright personality.

103
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,083
Excellent cooking skills,
beautiful appearance,

104
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,958
a good figure and long,
flowing black hair.

105
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,042
With that, I would have no complaints.

106
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,083
You have such high standards.

107
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,292
In that case, within my army…

108
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,625
Transfigure.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,042
Look. What do you think, Hero?

110
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,875
This is my disguise to avoid
drawing human attention.

111
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:02,500
Take a look at my lustrous, flowing
black hair and my hot body.

112
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,750
It just so happens to be your ideal type.

113
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,333
And as you know,

114
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,875
I can cook, clean, and do laundry.
I'm like a virtuous wife and good mother.

115
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,292
Of course, the personality is
faithful, decisive and forthright.

116
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,917
It's really troublesome.

117
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,750
We are mortal enemies after all.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But if we were to get married,

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,292
I would have a powerful intermediary
in the human realm.

120
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,333
I'm just teasing you…

121
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,958
I-Is that Zenia?

122
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,875
Coming, I will open the door now.

123
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,958
Thank you, Your Majesty.

124
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,667
What's wrong? Your cheeks are all red.

125
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,958
Could it be that you caught a cold?

126
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,625
No, I'm not blushing!

127
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,958
Don't worry, I'm perfectly fine.

128
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,542
Hero, do you want to become
my subordinate?

129
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,417
In doing so, you would also
have seven lives.

130
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:28,542
Why not enjoy eternal life with me?

131
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,708
Are you kidding me?

132
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,583
To abandon my human dignity
and become a demon,

133
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,208
I'd rather die here.

134
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,667
That's really a shame.

135
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,000
Then, fall into the oblivion of death.

136
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,625
Hero, do you want to become
my subordinate?

137
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,375
Reincarnate as a demon and gain power.

138
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,750
That way, you would also have seven lives.

139
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,500
Didn't you ask me this ten years ago?

140
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,583
Yes, I did.

141
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:59,000
I knew back then that
you would refuse my invitation.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,750
But what about now?

143
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,792
Are you an idiot?

144
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,083
I'm serious.

145
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,500
No way…

146
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,375
If you want to talk nonsense,
please do it in your dreams.

147
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,917
Don't prejudge and dismiss us.

148
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,208
At least listen to what I have to say.

149
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,375
Why are you so persistent
about this matter?

150
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,042
DEMON FAMILY, REINCARNATION SEMINAR
Come on, join the demon.

151
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,625
Reincarnation Seminar?

152
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,083
What's with this highly
suspicious seminar?

153
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:27,625
What are the benefits of no longer being
human and reincarnating as a demon?

154
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,333
Today, I will specially explain it to you.

155
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,000
Let us start with the first perk.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,208
WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS HIGH SALARY
The pay is very high.

157
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,917
Do you start out by talking about money?

158
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,125
Didn't Fred say it before?

159
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,125
You don't have much left in your savings.

160
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,458
You will be financially secure
if you work for me.

161
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,167
But I still have some savings.

162
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,042
After all, I used to earn a lot.

163
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:54,042
I won't be out of money for food tomorrow.

164
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,250
Regardless of tomorrow or the day after,

165
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,917
what about after ten or twenty years?

166
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,750
It's none of your business.

167
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,083
By then, I'll be dead. It doesn't matter.

168
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,583
You are saying this again.

169
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,208
People who say such things won't
shed a tear until they see the coffin.

170
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,417
Yes, your thoughts are too simple.

171
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,375
Assuming you work at my castle,

172
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,125
your starting salary is
480 000 yen per month,

173
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,583
with a bonus paid twice a year,

174
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,333
a guaranteed salary increase
and promotion, and pension benefits.

175
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,792
Of course, this is the salary
of a general soldier.

176
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:27,417
Given your exceptional abilities
and experience,

177
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,500
it will at least triple this.

178
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,792
Wait, what did you say?

179
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,417
Do you think it's not enough?

180
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,708
What about 2.5 million yen,
which is five times the amount?

181
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,083
Are you serious?

182
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,833
People in the human realm are
going to be so mad.

183
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,083
Hold on, Your Majesty.

184
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:48,333
No amount of money can buy happiness
without regular work breaks.

185
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,000
You don't have to worry about this.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,375
REASONABLE WORK SCHEDULE, NO OVERTIME, FOUR DAYS OFF PER WEEK
All demons are protected and have a comfortable working environment.

187
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,500
A maximum of five hours of work per day.

188
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,167
No overtime required.

189
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,208
Four days off every week.

190
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,958
Four days off every week?

191
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,583
It's really great.

192
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,042
You will not only be able to
maintain your private time,

193
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:09,458
but you will also have so much free time
that you will be at a loss for what to do.

194
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,625
Is this a privilege of castle staff?

195
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,500
No, I can't be unfair.

196
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,875
Private and government employees
are treated equally.

197
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,042
This is the right that
demons should enjoy.

198
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,208
Can society function like this?

199
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,542
Of course, it can function, with ease.

200
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:27,750
Hold on, Your Majesty.

201
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,458
Will work lose its meaning

202
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,958
if the welfare system is
not comprehensive enough?

203
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,792
Of course, our welfare system
is comprehensive.

204
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:40,292
We guarantee you a house in Jokamachi
or the residential area.

205
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:44,750
We have clear provisions for license
assistance, maternity, and parental leave.

206
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,917
Several other systems are in place
to fully support my subordinates.

207
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,667
So you guys can have children, huh?

208
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,625
What else? Oh ya.

209
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,708
BODY, BRAIN, MAGICAL POWER
A strong body that doesn't get sick,

210
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,625
BODY, BRAIN, MAGICAL POWER
a brain that doesn't age,

211
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,917
BODY, BRAIN, MAGICAL POWER
an endless supply of magical power,

212
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:03,125
and an immortal soul that can be
resurrected by sleeping.

213
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,875
UNDEAD BODY
Don't skip over the most characteristic part of being a demon.

214
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,708
CONTRACT, AGREE TO BECOME A DEMON
SIGN HERE

215
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,625
As long as you become one of us,

216
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,458
you can escape all the troubles
and insecurities of being human,

217
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,000
and the fear of death.

218
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,583
YOU SHOULD JOIN

219
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,958
Come spend eternity with me,

220
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,083
Max.

221
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,125
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,667
YOU SHOULD JOIN
Let's just forget about this.

223
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,375
Why?

224
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,458
Because you don't want to
be my subordinate?

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,125
IS IT BAD TO BE A DEMON?
Being a subordinate is just a formality.

226
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,750
IS IT BAD TO BE A DEMON?
We can maintain our current relationship.

227
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:03,208
Or is it because of what you said
ten years ago about "human dignity"?

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,667
Is "being human" that important to you?

229
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,417
What is this so-called human dignity?

230
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:16,125
Don't ask such
a difficult question so bluntly.

231
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,208
Didn't you say this yourself?

232
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,958
I was young and reckless back then.

233
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,125
Even though I spoke with conviction,
I was not sure what I was saying.

234
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:28,417
I am no longer insisting on being "human."

235
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,083
But how should I say this?

236
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,750
I can't easily give up "myself."

237
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,583
What does that mean?

238
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,250
Even if you reincarnate,
you won't lose your memory.

239
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,458
Becoming a demon means
eternal life, wealth, and power.

240
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,750
Then that "me" would no longer be me,
but a different creature.

241
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,083
Despite the fact that I was
a very different person

242
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,417
than I was ten years ago.

243
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,333
And it is extremely inconvenient
if I can't die.

244
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,417
I can't bear the burden of an undead body.

245
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,375
That's how it is for us humans.

246
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,625
DO YOU REALLY NOT WANT TO BE A DEMON?
Your suggestions are appreciated.

247
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,125
DO YOU REALLY NOT WANT TO BE A DEMON?
I must decline this invitation.

248
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,667
I…

249
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,167
I just wanted to be with you forever…

250
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,958
No, never mind.

251
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,167
It's such a pity, Your Majesty.

252
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,125
WHAT A SHAME

253
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,917
There's nothing we can do.

254
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,667
Max has seriously considered it.

255
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,792
Mr. Max,

256
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,500
I'll keep the contract.

257
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,208
If you want to reincarnate,
just let me know anytime.

258
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,417
Is this contract so casual?

259
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,917
But Hero,

260
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,750
since you've rejected my proposal,

261
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,167
you need to pull yourself together.

262
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,542
First, you need to plan your life.

263
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:46,958
You can't say anything like,
"I'll die in ten years."

264
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,875
Sorry, let me think…

265
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,292
Okay, I got it.

266
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,958
I'll find a way to solve
the money problem.

267
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,792
You'll see.

268
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:59,875
I'll definitely earn several times
the salary of the demon clan.

269
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,583
BURNING WITH PASSION
The Hero has regained his fighting spirit.

270
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,708
What is this thing?

271
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,083
I'm going to make a video.

272
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,375
A video?

273
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,167
I'll make a video and upload it to
the internet to make money.

274
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,917
Such a difficult concept.

275
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,125
Don't you know?

276
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,083
This is called "Poocuber."

277
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,375
The top people in it can earn over
100 million a year.

278
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,125
A yearly income of 100 million?
Are you serious?

279
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,875
Even if it doesn't reach that level,

280
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:30,542
some videos of people yelling and
playing games get millions of views.

281
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,542
With one view equaling one yen,

282
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,167
that is a million yen,
making money is far too simple.

283
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,917
Is it really that simple?

284
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,917
Alright, I'm starting now.

285
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:44,000
What kind of video should I make?
I guess I'll choose a game live stream.

286
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,208
Is he alright?

287
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,417
ROOM 205
Mr. Max wants to be a Poocuber?

288
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:54,083
Yeah, he just suddenly said it.

289
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,875
It is not as easy as Your Majesty
had been told.

290
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,292
You think so too, huh?

291
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:03,375
How much can a regular Poocuber earn?

292
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,792
The Hero said one view equals one yen.

293
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,958
MIKI
That's impossible, I heard the price is even lower.

294
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,333
According to data,
you can barely make a living

295
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,083
if you upload nearly every day and
each video receives over 100,000 views.

296
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
Isn't that tough?

297
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,042
This is not a job for the lazy.

298
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,167
To be honest, I don't think
Mr. Max is the right fit for this.

299
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,875
That's true,

300
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,875
but it's rare for him to show
such enthusiasm.

301
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,375
Your Majesty, you spoil him too much.

302
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,500
You should give him a wake-up call.

303
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,750
But how should I put it?

304
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,958
It's been a long time
since I've seen the Hero so serious.

305
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,750
It's like he's back to the time
when he fought against me ten years ago.

306
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,083
Is it that exaggerated?

307
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,542
How are you doing?

308
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,333
Don't talk to me right now.

309
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,958
The microphone will pick up your voice!

310
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,208
Do you think the views
will reach a million?

312
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,917
It's impossible to get
that many from the start.

313
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,875
I'm just starting out.

314
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,208
What if it really reaches a million?

315
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,417
Of course…

316
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,958
What's wrong?

317
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,542
The video…

318
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,333
FIRST GAME LIVE STREAM, FUN FREE GAME
No one is watching…

319
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,042
What kind of video did you make?
Let me see.

320
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,708
Stop it! Don't look! It's so embarrassing.

321
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,000
You idiot.

322
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,875
Haven't you already made it public for
the whole world to see?

323
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,042
Let me take a look.

324
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,375
Click here to watch, right?

325
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,333
SUPER INVINCIBLE FANTASY WORLD
It's starting.

326
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,833
SUPER INVINCIBLE FANTASY WORLD
Hello, uh…

327
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,292
I'm Poocuber Mackie.

328
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:41,125
That's your voice!

329
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,542
And you even named yourself Mackie.

330
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,542
Stop nagging.

331
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,500
Uh, this time, I'm playing a game…

332
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,250
A small game… a free small game...

333
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,042
That's the theme I want to introduce.

334
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,875
-So, what about me?
-Why are you mumbling and listless?

335
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,250
-It's my first time…
-Can't you speak more clearly?

336
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,833
My name is Mackie…
and I will keep uploading videos.

337
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:08,292
Uh, this is my first video.

338
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:12,375
From now on, please saport me…

339
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,000
Saport? What are you talking about?

340
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,083
This is the title screen.

341
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,833
The title's text…

342
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,125
Ah, you can see the game title.

343
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,875
And below it, there's "Start New Game,"
"Continue Playing", and "Exit".

344
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,042
Hurry up and start.

345
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:30,792
Let's immediately choose "Exit."

346
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,333
I'm just kidding, it should be
"Start New Game," haha.

347
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,375
-Let's get started right away.
-Finally starting.

348
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,375
I see, so this is how to defeat enemies.

349
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,792
One after another, not bad.

350
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:46,958
Watch me defeating enemies like this.

351
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,708
And then we move forward, watch me…

352
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,708
More enemies appearing, watch me…

353
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,333
Watch me…

354
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,042
Enemies show up again, watch me…

355
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:01,458
Nice. Hey, watch me.

356
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,042
You're running out of things
to say, aren't you?

357
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,333
It's the Demon King! The Demon King!
It's the Demon King!

358
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,083
Alright, let's defeat him.

359
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,417
This is excited! Watch me…

360
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,125
Darn it, I'm not going to lose. Watch me…

361
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:18,458
Watch me… Seagulls! It's funny, right?

362
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,708
14 VIEWS
14 views, huh?

363
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,583
There are actually 14 people
who watched this.

364
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,583
Don't be discouraged, Hero.

365
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,292
You've been working hard,
making videos late into the night.

366
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,750
That alone is impressive, don't you think?

367
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,125
You're right. I can't be discouraged
by such a small setback.

368
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,875
Since live streaming games
didn't work out,

369
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,458
I'll just make a new video.

370
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,958
I heard product review videos
are quite popular.

371
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,292
I'll give it a try.

372
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,292
Uh, I bought some
traditional pastries today.

373
00:17:57,292 --> 00:18:00,250
I'll taste them and see
which one is the best.

374
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,375
Uh, even though I can't show my face.

375
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,208
DELICIOUS TRADITIONAL PASTRY TASTE TEST
MACKIE TRIED MANY TRADITIONAL PASTRIES THIS TIME

376
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,625
MY MOTHER CHASTISED ME FOR SKIPPING
MEALS BECAUSE I LIKED TRADITIONAL PASTRY.

377
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,750

All of them are delicious, and they are all ranked No. 1.

379
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,542
I noticed there's
a Poocuber singer lately.

380
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,208
I'll try to debut as a singer too.

381
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:21,500
COVERED "LOVE STARS"
A love story as dazzling as the stars.

382
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,958
BAD SINGING AND POOR SOUND QUALITY, DON'T UNDERESTIMATE SINGING
Ahem…

383
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:24,958
Wait a moment…

384
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,042
THREE-EYED KING, I THINK YOUR SINGING IS NICE
I'll sing it again…

385
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,500
Current event topics

THE REAL FACE OF REPUBLIC GAMMA BRINGS TEARS
Let me make some easy money.

387
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,667
I'M A TERRORIST, THIS IS FAKE, RIGHT?
Let me make some easy money.

388
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,792
WHICH NEWS WEBSITE
DID YOU COPY THIS FROM?

389
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,917
SUBTITLES APPEAR TOO SLOW AND ARE HARD TO READ
PLEASE LEARN MORE ABOUT VIDEO PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES

390
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,542
THIS GARBAGE HAS FIVE ADS

391
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,500
THREE-EYED KING, YOU'RE AMAZING
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THESE THINGS BEFORE

392
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,583
MR. MACKIE IS SO KNOWLEDGEABLE
PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK IN THE FUTURE

393
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,167
Anyway, I can't be a Poocuber.

394
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:51,042
This job is much harder than it looks.

395
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,958
It's okay if you want to give up.

396
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,917
Don't force yourself to keep going.

397
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,917
Darn it.

398
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,500
Why not make one last video to try?

399
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,292
Do your best to make it.

400
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:06,583
If it's still not popular,
you'll be more willing to give up.

401
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,417
I won't force you.

402
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,667
If necessary, I can help you too.

403
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,417
Really? Are you willing to help me?

404
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:19,958
Of course.

405
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,042
I can be the cameraman, I'll do anything.

406
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,167
LIVE STREAM STARTING SOON

407
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,000
CURRENTLY STREAMING

408
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,167

00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,500
NO PROBLEM
It seems like there's no issue.

410
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,500
Hello everyone, I'm the Three-eyed King.

411
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,042

412
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:48,042
this thing called "live streaming."

413
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,125
REMEMBER TO SMILE
Will people really come to watch me?

414
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,875
Nice to meet you all.

415
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,125
HELLO, WHO ARE YOU? IT'S MY FIRST TIME WATCHING.
YOUR WAY OF SPEAKING IS SO STRANGE.

416
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,458
READ THE COMMENTS AND CHAT WITH THEM

417
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:03,875
It seems quite a few people
have come. How nice…

418
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,417
My way of speaking?

419
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,792
Is it that strange? Hahaha.

420
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,167
INTERESTING CHARACTER, STRONG PERSONALITY
IS THAT A SCHOOL'S UNIFORM? A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL?

421
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,792
Are you talking about my outfit?

422
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,542
This is a school uniform.

423
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,417
That's right.

424
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,083
It has a very human style…

425
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,208
No, I mean, it's very friendly.

426
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,583
STAND UP, LET THEM SEE YOUR OUTFIT
No, I mean, it's very friendly.

427
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,375
Look.

428
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,167
This is just a normal
school uniform, right?

That's right.

437
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,708
He told me to have popsicle
on the live stream.

438
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,417
No. I suddenly wanted to
have some popsicle.

439
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,333
Alright, now I'm going to
taste and review this popsicle.

440
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,792
Watch closely, everyone.

441
00:20:59,417 --> 00:20:59,958

Sweet and cold, refreshing flavor…

00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,333

Everyone's comments are so lively.

448
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,125
Oh no, I accidentally
dripped onto my clothes.

449
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,667
I'm feeling hot anyway.

450
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,875
Might as well take it off.

451
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,042
IS THIS FOR REAL? AWESOME! IS THERE SOMEONE BEHIND YOU?
BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET YOUR CHANNEL BANNED
