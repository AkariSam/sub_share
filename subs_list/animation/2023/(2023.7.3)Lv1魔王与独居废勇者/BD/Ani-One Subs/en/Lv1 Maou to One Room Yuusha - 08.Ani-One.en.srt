(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

2
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:34,083
(Episode 8: Farewell)

3
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,000
What exactly happened here?

4
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,667
First of all, I need to escape.

5
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,000
Zenia,

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,958
humans are not like us demons.
They are unable to reawaken from the dead.

7
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,167
Therefore, we must not kill humans
without cause. Do you get it?

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,542
Are you okay? Pull yourself together.

9
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,458
The eighth of the seven spy tools,
first aid kit.

10
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,458
Don't worry, you will definitely be saved.

11
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,833
Everyone, please stay away.

12
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,125
Everyone, please do not crowd around.

13
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,458
If I return empty-handed,

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,333
it will harm the demon's reputation.

15
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,042
I must bring something.

16
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,958
Anything is fine,
but I need to take something back.

17
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,833
Oh ya.

18
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,167
Something bad happened, Max.

19
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,208
BREAKING NEWS: UNUSUAL EXPLOSION AT THE MAGIC BUREAU
As previously stated, an unusual explosion occurred.

20
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,042
As previously stated, an unusual explosion
occurred at the Magic Bureau

21
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:10,583
-at 4 p.m. this afternoon.
-What happened? Did this just occur now?

22
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,667
-Most of the staff have successfully evacuated.
-Is this a terrorist attack?

23
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,958
Doesn't Fred work in this building?

24
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,875
You don't need to worry about that guy,

25
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,542
he will definitely be unharmed
by an explosion of this degree.

26
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,458
I-I see.

27
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:29,250
I actually asked Zenia to
investigate the Magic Bureau.

28
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,583
So, is this woman to blame
for the explosion?

29
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,958
Why would you say that?

30
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't ask her to personally
go to the Magic Bureau scene,

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,250
and I certainly didn't ask her
to bring a bomb.

32
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,667
I guess you are right.

33
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,292
-Mr. Oi.
-Yes.

34
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,167
-Mr. Oi.
-Okay… yes…

35
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:54,167
Excuse me, as just mentioned…

36
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,625
At four o'clock this afternoon…

37
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,625
Shall we watch a variety show?

38
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,750
Okay.

39
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,875
Y-Your majesty…

40
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:12,667
I…am…back…

41
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,625
It stinks.

42
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,250
Huh?

43
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,333
Have you regained consciousness?

44
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,042
That's great, you're awake.

45
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,750
May I ask who are you?

46
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,292
It hurts…

47
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,875
Are you okay?
Don't push yourself too hard.

48
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,167
You were seriously injured
and collapsed at our front door.

49
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,625
I recalled it. At that time…

50
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,542
Did I lose consciousness back then?

51
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,542
Why didn't she take me to the hospital?
Why did she let me stay here?

52
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,333
Then you take a good rest.

53
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,250
I'll go prepare something
to eat right away.

54
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,542
This room…

55
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,083
I seem to have seen it somewhere…

56
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,875
Thank you.

57
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,750
Did you bandage me?

58
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,750
Yes.

59
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,583
Do you live here alone?

60
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,792
No, I have a husband, but he's away.

61
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,417
Is that her work uniform?

62
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:26,250
The hem of that dress
is inexplicably short.

63
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,458
Do you have anything you want to eat?

64
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:33,542
I appreciate your kindness, but it is
not necessary. I have to go back to work.

65
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm sorry for leaving.

66
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:38,625
No, you can't move around yet.

67
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,917
That won't do, I…

68
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:46,875
You rest a little more.

69
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,375
Okay?

70
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,333
B-But…

71
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,750
You're young and talented,

72
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,750
and you have endless magical power.

73
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,208
Being a human is such a waste for you.

74
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,542
Don't be Fred's subordinate.

75
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,542
CONTRACT
Why don't you come work for me?

76
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,958
You can also have seven lives,

77
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,875
two annual bonuses,

78
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,667
various types of insurance,

79
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:16,000
and a generous housing allowance.

80
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,958
What's your name?

81
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,083
I am… Lim…

82
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,125
Excellent.

83
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,042
Lim, take my hand.

84
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:31,875
Join me on the journey to immortal life.

85
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,333
Stop it.

86
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:37,250
What are you doing, Max? This is
domestic violence. Domestic violence.

87
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,750
Don't force people to sign
improper contracts.

88
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,083
I shouldn't have left it to you.

89
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,625
Sign… Contract…

90
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,250
I am truly sorry

91
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,708
this time.

92
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,875
So it was on the orders of
that long-haired lady

93
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,625
that the bespectacled lady
infiltrated the Magic Bureau.

94
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,750
Yes.

95
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,792
But it was my initiative to break in.

96
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:06,167
I should bear all the responsibility.

97
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:07,792
No.

98
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:11,125
My vague instructions caused this chaos.

99
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,042
She is not at fault.

100
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,125
Anyway,

101
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:18,708
the landlord, Max,
had nothing to do with this.

102
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,917
Please be lenient with him.

103
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:26,750
You two are from the demon clan, right?

104
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,667
Yes, indeed.

105
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,875
Mr. Max, what exactly is going on?

106
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,292
Let me explain.

107
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,167
After the death of the Demon Lord,

108
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,583
we, the lower-class servants
of the demon, became homeless.

109
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,792
We have been living a life of poverty.

110
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,833
We can't fill our stomachs.

111
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,333
We can only eat and sleep in the cold.

112
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,417
He's blatantly lying.

113
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,750
It is only fair that we are punished
for causing humans trouble.

114
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,417
But our hearts are actually
on the verge of breaking.

115
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,333
But this great hero, Mr. Max,

116
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,417
felt sorry for us because
we had lost our master

117
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,625
and took us in.

118
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:10,208
Despite the fact that he despises us
and has no obligation to assist the demon.

119
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,958
Mr. Max's thoughtful heart
has deeply moved us.

120
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:20,083
We decided to turn a new leaf and live
for society, for humanity, from now on.

121
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,125
Right, Zenia?

122
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,125
Right, well said!

123
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,000
We wanted to look into the Magic Bureau

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,667
simply to learn more about human labor.

125
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,375
But a misunderstanding
led to this situation.

126
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,125
We're really embarrassed.

127
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,917
I see, I understand everything now.

128
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,250
She actually understood.

129
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,500
This woman seems to be
an incurable do-gooder.

130
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,167
There was an explosion in
the Magic Bureau.

131
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,958
It wasn't what you did, right?

132
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,042
O-Of course not.

133
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,917
We would never let this girl have
something like that in her possession.

134
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,708
I thought you had accidentally
set gas on fire

135
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,042
or something with your fire magic.

136
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:03,125
My flames won't
accidentally ignite gas or oil.

137
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,333
Because the ability to ignite
or extinguish is within my grasp.

138
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,125
I find myself wanting to
recruit her more and more.

139
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,792
But if so, that explosion…

140
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,000
Right, I almost forgot to
return this to you.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,917
Miss Lim, this is your phone.

142
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,292
There were many calls
when you were asleep.

143
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,250
CHIEF FRED

144
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,750
Can I answer it?

145
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,667
Sure.

146
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,708
Hello.

147
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,500
Lim, where are you?

148
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,125
I'm very sorry, Chief.

149
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,542
I was injured in the explosion
and passed out.

150
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,583
And now…

151
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,583
Someone is helping me with my injuries.

152
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,542
So you're in the hospital?

153
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,125
No, no, where are you?

154
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,458
I'm at…

155
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,958
Just tell the truth, it's okay.

156
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,042
I'm at Hero Max's house.

157
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,750
Let me talk to him.

158
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,708
Fred.

159
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,917
Alright, Max.

160
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,833
Can you please explain in detail?

161
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,833
Attack a national institution
in collaboration with the demon clan.

162
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,000
You, the hero, have also fallen.

163
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,917
I admit that I have ties
to the demon clan.

164
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,083
But that explosion wasn't our doing.

165
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,958
Is that so?

166
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,208
But we can pretend it was you.

167
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,583
Or rather, it's more convenient for us
to treat you as the criminal.

168
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,667
Anyway, I will explain everything.

169
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,833
Can we meet?

170
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,167
Sure.

171
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,542
Just wait at your home,
I'll be right there.

172
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,792
Remember to tell the demon clans
to come out and see me too.

173
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,292
Alright.

174
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,167
But you must have noticed
the presence of the demon clan

175
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,667
the last time you visited my house.

176
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,958
Why did you suddenly…

177
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,333
Who are you?

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,625
LIM, ON CALL
Fred, can you hear me?

179
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,292
What's wrong with you?

180
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,583
Your house… is a bit too small.

181
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,667
There's a place I often go to.

182
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,917
I'll have someone take you there,
let's meet directly at the shop.

183
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,125
Don't try to run away.

184
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,417
Okay.

185
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:25,042
Right, you wouldn't play
such petty tricks.

186
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,250
GARBLED CHARACTERS, INCOMING CALL

187
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,958
DECLINE

188
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,833
I am sure you can hear me, right?

189
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,750
Answer the phone!

190
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,292
This area is directly beneath
the explosion site.

191
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,750
Everyone, be careful of collapses.

192
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,667
Okay.

193
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,333
Someone passed out!

194
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,583
-You coward…
-It's Chief Fred.

195
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,667
-You coward…
-Did he get caught in the explosion?

196
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,750
-You coward…
-This is bad, start the rescue immediately.

197
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,667
Captain, why did the Magic Bureau
explode all of a sudden?

198
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:04,583
I don't know, but if it really was
a terrorist attack by the Republic Gamma…

199
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,458
Things have become serious.

200
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,833
BESKER KINGDOM, CABINET OFFICE BUILDING

201
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,708
NINE MINISTERS' MEETING

202
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,000
FOURTH MINISTER, REINHARD
What a disaster out of the blue.

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
FOURTH MINISTER, REINHARD
I heard you were in the Magic Bureau at the time.

204
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:23,292
THIRD MINISTER, GREMES
Yes, I almost got caught in it. Such a headache.

205
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,458
SIXTH MINISTER, HAYWARD
Fortunately, you are safe.

206
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,750
SIXTH MINISTER, HAYWARD
But the situation is now quite serious.

207
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,042
FIRST MINISTER, FRANCA
I knew this day would come sooner or later

208
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,083
FIRST MINISTER, FRANCA
after you guys drove Leo away.

209
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:39,625
Isn't this good?
We now have a reason to go to war.

210
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,417
EIGHTH MINISTER, MENEHERDO
That's not what this was about.

211
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,375
EIGHTH MINISTER, MENEHERDO
This is obviously a terrorist attack by the Republic.

212
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,375
EIGHTH MINISTER, MENEHERDO
It's a crisis for the kingdom and our people.

213
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,958
FIFTH MINISTER, SEMAN
Can't we find a way to put this to rest?

214
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,875
SECOND MINISTER, TRIGOLIN
Then what do you propose we do?

215
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,708
SECOND MINISTER, TRIGOLIN
Should we bow to them and ask them to stop?

216
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:02,875
If we go to war,
our army will not back down.

217
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,667
However, all of our battles up
to this point have been for show

218
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,875
and to stake claim to the land.

219
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,417
NINTH MINISTER, GEORGE
So we have never really clashed

220
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,708
NINTH MINISTER, GEORGE
and have avoided casualties.

221
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,125
NINTH MINISTER, GEORGE
But this time, it's different.

222
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,292
If the kingdom's army
launches a total attack…

223
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,917
He will show his true power.

224
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:25,333
Even if we win, I am afraid
we will suffer significant losses.

225
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,667
I don't want to send my men
to their deaths.

226
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,708
"Even if we win"?
You really dare to say it.

227
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,625
We can't win, which is
why we can only pick faults.

228
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,583
You're just a trash soldier.
What kind of attitude is that?

229
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,417
You're going too far, Sezac.

230
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,667
SEVENTH MINISTER, SEZAC
Alright, alright, sorry.

231
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,625
So, what we need is
a force that can compete with Leo.

232
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,417
The only force that can compete
with a hero's companion is,

233
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,292
of course, a hero's companion.

234
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,500
Gremes,

235
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,375
you're pretty close with Fred, right?

236
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,000
Can you handle it?
After all, the others are useless.

237
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,708
Oh my.

238
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,583
I have had a run of bad luck.

239
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,750
This restaurant looks very upscale.

240
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,917
After all, this is the chief's
favorite restaurant.

241
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,292
Shave your beard clean!

242
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,667
Otherwise, we will not be allowed in!

243
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,750
This is really luxurious.

244
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,833
Do you eat such good food every day?
That's scary.

245
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,500
I don't eat it every day.

246
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,208
Eat it. We haven't
dined together in a long time.

247
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,167
Lady, please enjoy your meal as well.

248
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,292
Thank you so much.

249
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,292
Wow, Max, look.

250
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,250
This sashimi is so clear and translucent.

251
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,583
Thank you for the meal.

252
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,083
It's so hard… It's so delicious.

253
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,500
You are powerful demon clans.

254
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:58,458
CUSTOMER FIRST
And almost perfectly disguised as humans.

255
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,250
I had no idea such
dangerous demon clans still existed.

256
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,125
Is her name Zenia?

257
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,917
Is that glasses demon clan
your subordinate?

258
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:08,958
Yes.

259
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,292
Sorry, Fred.

260
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,208
We have really caused
you a lot of trouble.

261
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,417
I am very sorry.

262
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,208
Anyway, you seem to be enjoying it.
That's great too.

263
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:25,292
After all, no human woman
will be looking at you right now.

264
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,500
Even though you are a hero.

265
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,708
Mind your own business.

266
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,125
But I really envy you that

267
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,000
you get to live with two beautiful women.

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,417
It's embarrassing.

269
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,833
I wonder what he would think
if he knew his true identity.

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,917
Anyway,

271
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:47,458
I need to clarify the explosion
at Magic Bureau…

272
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,750
I know it wasn't what you did.

273
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,375
Zenia left traces everywhere

274
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,917
after infiltrating
the Magic Bureau from the roof.

275
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,542
Even if she is stupid,
she will not be wandering around

276
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,333
inside the building
if she planted the bomb, right?

277
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,583
I-I see.

278
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,583
So you understand. You're really sensible.

279
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,792
Thank you. Friends are there for
when you're in trouble.

280
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,167
Enough said.

281
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,042
So this matter is settled then.

282
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,667
Thanks for the meal. See you next time.

283
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,333
Don't leave.

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,208
I won't interfere this time.

285
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,667
Consequently, you're responsible
for the aftermath.

286
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,458
Um… Maybe you could spend the night
with the woman. How is it?

287
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,375
A-Are you joking?

288
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,583
What are you thinking, Max?
You're a menace to women!

289
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,000
Should you really say that as a hero?

290
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,375
Let us cut to the chase,
Zenia is your subordinate, right?

291
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,458
When a subordinate makes a mistake,
the superior should take responsibility.

292
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,167
F-Fine, I guess there's no choice.

293
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,042
I will serve you until you are satisfied…

294
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,625
I don't need it! Put your clothes back on!

295
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,625
I have serious matters to discuss.
Sit down, both of you.

296
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,625
Okay.

297
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,125
Don't you need my naked body?

298
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,375
We are officially going to war
with Republic Gamma.

299
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,417
Who told those idiots to commit such
a stupid act as a bomb terror attack?

300
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,250
Was it really the Republic who did it?

301
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,667
Of course, who else could it be?

302
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,208
Who knows.

303
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,625
I just thought the explosion
was a bit lackluster.

304
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,708
What do you mean by that, Max?

305
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,292
Nothing.

306
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,417
Max.

307
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,792
You think I really want to go to war
with the Republic?

308
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,417
How could that be possible?

309
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,042
Quite the opposite.

310
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:43,667
If you are willing to assist the Kingdom,
I would be very happy.

311
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,125
But it doesn't matter
if you don't want to help.

312
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:50,792
I can avoid a full-fledged conflict
with the Republic

313
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:54,667
as long as I can blame you
and those demon clans for the explosion.

314
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,250
Personally, I'm fine with either.

315
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,708
This is your ultimatum.

316
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,083
Make your choice again.

317
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,458
Fight for the kingdom, return as a hero.

318
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,750
Or you can be an accomplice
to the demon clans

319
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,458
and end up as a major criminal.

320
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,292
I am suddenly irritated!

321
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,917
I might as well move.

322
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:26,792
Move to the Republic Gamma with her.

323
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,167
What did you just say?

324
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,625
The hot springs there are really great.

325
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,667
The Republic Gamma is a good place.

326
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:39,750
You agree, right?

327
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,917
Let's leave this country with
its strong smell of gunpowder behind

328
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,583
and lead a leisurely life,
soaking in hot springs!

329
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,458
It wouldn't be bad at all, plus there's
an abundant magical ore vein there,

330
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,583
so we might still make a fortune
from it in the future!

331
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:54,583
I can't just pretend I didn't hear that.

332
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,667
You're declaring yourself a terrorist.

333
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,792
You will become a complete enemy
of the kingdom.

334
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,208
That's right.

335
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:05,208
Don't make an enemy of the great hero
who defeated the Demon Lord.

336
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,500
So when you ask me for a favor,
show more sincerity.

337
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,583
Stop being so narcissistic.

338
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,125
You can't call yourself a hero
in your current state.

339
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,375
You're just a powerful
and troublesome NEET.

340
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,542
I'm angry! I'm furious!
I'm moving right now!

341
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,958
I'm moving to the Republic Gamma!

342
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,542
The Republic would refuse to accept

343
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,500
a large piece of trash like you!

344
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Wake up, you fool!

345
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,875
Stop it…

346
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,708
Shut up! You're the big fool!

347
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,333
All you do is cause pointless disputes!

348
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,958
You can keep fighting until you drop dead!
Don't drag me into it!

349
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:41,250
We must end these pointless disputes!
How do you not understand this?

350
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,500
Let you fools kill
each other as you please!

351
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,292
As long as you and Leo are dead,

352
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,042
my ears will finally have some peace!

353
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,333
You bastard!

354
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,375
Stop it!

355
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,542
Let me go.

356
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:04,917
Max, who is this demon clan?

357
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,250
None of your business. We're leaving.

358
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,625
Don't think this is the end.

359
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,125
Your powers are too troublesome.

360
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,125
If we can't control…

361
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:23,542
Right, I didn't bring any money today.
I'll leave the bill to you.

362
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,542
After all, you're paying
with taxpayers' money.

363
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,458
I should have poisoned the drink.

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,542
We're back.

365
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,083
Don't just throw
your clothes anywhere, Max.

366
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,625
This one is a rare formal outfit.

367
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,000
Welcome back.

368
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,667
Max, what's wrong with you?

369
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,208
Could it be…

370
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,583
Damn it, I've been set up.

371
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,375
I feel relieved.

372
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,208
I thought you were really poisoned.

373
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,958
Laxatives are almost as bad as poison.

374
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,333
That bastard.

375
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,833
He probably put it in your drink
from the start.

376
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,792
If I had agreed to his terms,
what would he have done?

377
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,500
Perhaps he knew you would never agree.

378
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,583
It's probably retaliation
for the Zenia incident.

379
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,792
ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN A REPUBLIC GAMMA TERRORIST ATTACK
MAGIC BUREAU EXPLOSION INCIDENT

380
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,333
That's ridiculous.
I can't believe they're doing this.

381
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,750
Those guys are too despicable.

382
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,833
It's rotten to the core.

383
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,583
Captain, we swear
we didn't launch a terror attack.

384
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,833
I know.

385
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,625
They seem to be serious.

386
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,458
I no longer consider
that place to be my homeland

387
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,500
if they believe that
such measures will succeed.

388
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,250
If they dare, let them come.
