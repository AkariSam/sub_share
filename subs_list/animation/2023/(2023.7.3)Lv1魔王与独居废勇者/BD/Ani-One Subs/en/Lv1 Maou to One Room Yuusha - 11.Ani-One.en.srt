1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:03,083
I really can't stand you.

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,250
Every time, I have to heal you.
Such a hassle.

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:08,125
Your way of fighting is too crazy.

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,500
Sorry for bothering you
all the time, Fred.

5
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:14,000
If it weren't for you,
I would have died a long time ago.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,792
Of course.

7
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,625
But you're not
the only one who causes trouble.

8
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,458
It's just that you are
more troublesome than others.

9
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:22,917
Take it.

10
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,625
What is this?

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,167
If it's some minor magic,

12
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,250
that talisman can nullify it.

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,000
You'll be more secure with it, won't you?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,083
Really? Thanks, Fred.

15
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:34,583
Ouch.

16
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,625
Please, can you save me some trouble?

17
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,500
Really. Fred just isn't honest.

18
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,042
If only he wasn't so rigid.

19
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,167
Like his way of speaking, for example.

20
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,000
But Leo also has issues.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,292
That guy is too brazen.

22
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:59,083
He causes others to worry,
but he is completely unaware.

23
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:03,208
-Because he's too strong, he doesn't understand others' feelings.
-Does it look good on me?

24
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,542
-Fred will lose his temper sooner or later.
-You don't need to wear it, keep it.

25
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,042
You're so observant, Yuria.

26
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:11,958
Anyway, they can
still flirt with each other.

27
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,083
-Hey you.
-I don't think it's a problem for now.

28
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:13,875
-Hey you.
-What's the matter, Fred?

29
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,250
-You said flirting…
-What's the matter, Fred?

30
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,708
If something goes wrong between them,

31
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,417
you must mediate for them.

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,625
Me?

33
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,417
I really can't handle it.

34
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:29,292
Please, Max.

35
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,125
LABOR ROOM

36
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,333
It seems like a big problem
has occurred with the heroes.

37
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,583
No time to care about them now, Sara.

38
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,917
I've got a big problem here too.

39
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:45,083
Can you hold on a bit longer?

40
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,792
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

41
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:24,292
(Episode 11: Hero, Utterly Defeated)

42
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,167
W-What? Something flew past.

43
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,458
This is…

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,125
Are you a frog?

45
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,292
Who is this guy?

46
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,625
I think I've seen him somewhere.

47
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,250
Isn't this person… Hero Max?

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,000
Really?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,917
Has he turned into this kind of old man?

50
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,208
Ten years ago, he was…

51
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,708
What the hell. It hurts so much.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,292
I wish I hadn't come.

53
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,417
It's not good at all, damn it.

54
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,000
Minister,

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,875
Chief Fred is the only one fighting
for our country. What do you think?

56
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,167
It's not just him
who's fighting for our country.

57
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:11,667
Just in case,
the kingdom's army is standing by.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,292
What do you mean by 'just in case'?

59
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:18,875
Are you suggesting
there's a risk to the homeland?

60
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:25,167
No, our kingdom's citizens' safety
or interests will not be threatened.

61
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:29,000
-Please rest easy and carry on as usual…
-Look!

62
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:31,417
Minister, just now,

63
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:34,042
Max appeared before Leo and Fred.

64
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,750
See, girl. I told you so.

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,458
I-It's amazing.

66
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,958
Next, all Max has to do is stop Leo…

67
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,792
Will things really go that smoothly?

68
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,417
Even if the current Max
can win this battle,

69
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:52,833
I don't think
he'll blindly obey the kingdom.

70
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,042
Ignore her.

71
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,792
Look, it's about to start.

72
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,042
What are you doing here at this point?

73
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,875
Do you want to be
the heroic savior of the kingdom's crisis?

74
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,125
Kingdom's crisis? Don't flatter yourself.

75
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,917
Do you think your existence is so great?

76
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,542
Even if I have to oppose both of you,

77
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,667
I will fight to protect this land.

78
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,500
You talk a good game.

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,958
In essence, you've illegally
occupied our territory with thugs.

80
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,875
The one who wants
to seize land is the kingdom.

81
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,750
You know that very well, right?

82
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,875
Shut up, you two idiots!

83
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,417
Who cares about
the kingdom or the republic?

84
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,292
You guys talk a lot of crap.

85
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,625
I've had enough of you.

86
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,917
I might as well take you both down,

87
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,083
so I don't have to see you in the future.

88
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:49,125
That's the reality.

89
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:54,375
Get ready for a fight to the death.

90
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,917
You say I'm talking crap?

91
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,125
What are you joking about?

92
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,292
What does a loser like you, who is
out of touch with society, understand?

93
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,250
If you don't understand, don't pretend to.

94
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,292
Yeah, I don't understand.

95
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:09,208
How would I know your difficulties?

96
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,083
I'm just pissed off,
so I'm going to beat you up.

97
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,083
It's as simple as that.

98
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,750
Idiot, go to hell, moron.

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,625
Although I'm not sure what's going on,

100
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,250
it seems that you're
not here to support Fred.

101
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,542
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

102
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,167
After all, the last one
standing is the winner.

103
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,083
It's simple. It's good.

104
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,417
Come on, Max, Fred!

105
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,792
You two fools!

106
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,792
I think you're all doomed
if you don't reincarnate.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,458
That's amazing,

108
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,042
these images are extremely valuable.

109
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,708
Even though we can do nothing but watch.

110
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,458
Seman, what do you think?

111
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,208
Perhaps this is
retribution for our actions.

112
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,250
What's up with you, Max?

113
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,125
You're slowing down.

114
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,083
Shut up!

115
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,208
Huh?

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,125
You're pontificating over there,
even brought out the Sacred Sword.

117
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,375
What's with you, Max?

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
You're making a lot of noise.

119
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,292
Don't forget it's been ten years.

120
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,917
My skills can't be as agile as a monkey.

121
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,375
Aren't we the same age?

122
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,583
Shut up.

123
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,125
You disappoint me deeply.

124
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,000
You're not a hero.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,625
Utterly foolish.

126
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,750
You can't go on living in shame.

127
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,292
I might as well
send you off with my own hands.

128
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,792
Max.

129
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,625
Is he still alive?

130
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,333
-What's wrong?
-Did you see it?

131
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,750
It's no use.

132
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,542
I have no chance of winning.

133
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,583
I was so reckless that I shocked myself.

134
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,583
I actually wanted to fight head-on.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,917
We must not give up!

136
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,917
Lord Behmas,

137
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,375
please kill these guys.

138
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,750
We must not give up!

139
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,292
What do you mean we must not give up?

140
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:46,250
Cut the pep talk, Max.

141
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,208
How do you intend
to fight your way out of this situation

142
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,167
in the face of such a behemoth?

143
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,500
The enemy is flying around,
your swords aren't hitting,

144
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,167
our attack spells are weakening,

145
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,208
we're insane to come here

146
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,792
and fight this kind of opponent.

147
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,917
Don't worry, I'll be the shield.

148
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:09,125
You always make me
heal you when you play shield.

149
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,083
How many more times
can you use the healing spell?

150
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,292
At most four or five times.

151
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,750
The situation is getting worse.

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,250
Really, so I've been saying
not to engage with this kind of opponent.

153
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,583
Stop nagging about the past.

154
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,500
Max said we must not give up.

155
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,833
No matter what, we have
to keep fighting until the last moment.

156
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:31,917
Yuria.

157
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,917
You're right, Yuria.

158
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,375
I believe in Max and in you guys.

159
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,375
Since you dare to talk big,

160
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,750
you must have a plan, right?

161
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,250
Well…

162
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,667
Because my spells aren't working either,

163
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,042
it seems we can only rely
on the sword to attack.

164
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,333
Max, open your mouth.

165
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,500
Maximum Drive.

166
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:09,125
This strengthening spell is my trump card,
it concentrates all my magical power.

167
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,000
Let me say it beforehand,
I can only use this move once,

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,208
settle the fight
while your body can still move.

169
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,833
Go, Max!

170
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,750
Finish him
while my barrier can still hold!

171
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,625
You lucky guy.

172
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,417
Do you want to be beaten again?

173
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,333
That is…

174
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,833
So that's how it is. I miss it.

175
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,083
What's that bitch doing meddling?

176
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,208
Max, can you hear me?

177
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,500
Clear as a bell.

178
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,833
You don't have to answer me,
this is pre-recorded.

179
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,417
You know too, right?

180
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,833
The Maximum Drive spell won't last long.

181
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,167
You have to settle the fight
while your body can still move.

182
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:13,083
But I guess those two
understand this very well.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,375
Yeah.

184
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,625
I'm sorry I can't help in person,

185
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,583
but you can't ask
a pregnant woman to fight, right?

186
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,375
So this time, I'm counting on you.

187
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,708
I believe in you, hero.

188
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,875
Go teach those two idiots a lesson.

189
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,875
Bitch, don't come out to mess up!

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,583
Come on, Max, try to stop us.

191
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,125
Damn it, captain.

192
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,417
A kid?

193
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,083
You're awake. Are you okay?

194
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,833
I'm fine.

195
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,083
You're the young man
from the other day, aren't you?

196
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,375
How's Max doing?

197
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,500
Do you have a phone on you?

198
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,500
How about it, Max? Can you beat me?

199
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,958
Do you have any way to defeat me
before the Maximum Drive goes off?

200
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,667
Shut up!

201
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,167
Lie down and be quiet, fool!

202
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,792
Finish him off!

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,542
This place needs to be like this…

204
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,208
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

205
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,625
What the hell
are we doing this nonsense for?

206
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,000
Leo.

207
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,292
Isn't the root of all of this
because you did something stupid?

208
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,375
Max.

209
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,000
If you had been willing
to help me from the start,

210
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,083
we wouldn't have to fight each other.

211
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,750
What a joke.

212
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,000
How do you plan to clean up this mess?

213
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,167
What difference will it make
if you knock us down, Max?

214
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,750
Are you going to take my place
at the mercy of the kingdom?

215
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,333
Yuria, you too.

216
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,208
Why is everyone so stupid?

217
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,958
The real fool is me.

218
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,250
Max…

219
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,333
Everyone is the same.

220
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,083
They don't understand the pains of others.

221
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,375
I can't take it anymore!

222
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,875
Disappear, fools!

223
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,667
What?

224
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:41,333
Y-You… Just as I thought…

225
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,708
It hurts so much, I'm in pain all over.

226
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,583
G-Great! The hero won!

227
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,042
Wait, is it a good thing that Max won?

228
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:15,583
What next? What to do next?

229
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,958
Damn it.

230
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,375
The camera.

231
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,750
Is it that one?

232
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,500
I would like to apologize profusely

233
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,625
for this incident.

234
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:06,292
My companions have
caused you all a great deal of trouble.

235
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,583
I'm truly sorry.

236
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,333
However, I kindly request…

237
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,375
all of you who are currently watching this

238
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,625
to be understanding

239
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,708
and considerate
in dealing with this matter.

240
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,833
What is he doing?

241
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,042
Could you please think of a way

242
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:48,958
to resolve this peacefully

243
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:54,000
for the sake of these two
not having to fight again?

244
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,375
Please, everyone.

245
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,917
I'm begging for your help, please.

246
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,750
Please, everyone.

247
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,875
I'm begging for your help.

248
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:09,917
Please. Please, everyone.
