1
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:06,292
Max, sorry to keep you waiting.

2
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:08,667
Here's your favorite hamburger steak.

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:11,458
Why is there more? Really.

4
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey, how could you drink first?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,708
You were supposed to toast with me.

6
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,833
What? That's a non-alcoholic drink, right?

7
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,417
You should open it quickly.

8
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,042
It's overflowing.

9
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:25,000
Tsk.

10
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,833
(Episode12: Everything They Have Brought)

11
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,375
What's wrong, Max?

12
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,250
You've stopped eating.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,958
MAN OF THE DAY
Is the food not good?

14
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,792
MAN OF THE DAY
No, it's not. You cooked too much.

15
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:42,667
How many portions are there?
I'm almost dizzy from eating.

16
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:46,667
And how did you manage to cook
so much food in our kitchen?

17
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,417
The pizza and cake
are handmade too, right?

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,500
You can't even finish
this tiny amount. You're useless.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,667
This is a rare victory celebration
for the hero, come on!

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,917
This pudgy beer belly
can't fit much in, huh?

21
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,458
Stop it.

22
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,917
But your agility is quite impressive.

23
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:07,750
An agile fat guy.

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,833
Fat guy.

25
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,708
Come on, I'm not fat at all.

26
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:11,542
I'm not fat, am I?

27
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:14,750
Hard to say.

28
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,875
-I'm not fat, right? Right?
-I'll slaughter you guys.

29
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,750
Fat guy.

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,417
I admire you greatly.

31
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:30,042
You defeated Leo and Fred,
and saved them as well.

32
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:34,333
You further influenced the future
of the Kingdom and the Republic.

33
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,792
It wasn't just my strength.

34
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,333
Without Yuria's help,
I would have been sent to my death.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,583
It's all her credit.

36
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:44,958
And thank you too.

37
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,375
I didn't… do anything special…

38
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,667
That's not true.

39
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,167
You certainly did.

40
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:58,750
Thank you.

41
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,333
Indeed, I cooked a bit too much.

42
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,792
We'll save the leftovers for tomorrow.

43
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:10,542
Alright, I'm starting to feel sleepy
from eating too much.

44
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,625
If we invite Zenia over,
maybe we could finish it.

45
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,917
Why don't you call her over now?

46
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,583
Geez. I'm not going to invite her today.

47
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:26,500
Your Majesty, I'm terribly sorry.

48
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,583
What happened, Zenia?

49
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,542
Well, the thing is…

50
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:35,667
I used my laptop to analyze the computer
brought back from the Magic Bureau.

51
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,417
There's all sorts of data. I don't get it.

52
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,458
What is this?

53
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,083
Press it and good things will happen.

54
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:46,792
Okay then.

55
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,792
YOUR FILES HAVE BEEN STOLEN

56
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,625
So it's what they call
a computer virus, huh?

57
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,667
Anyway, it's all in the past,
don't worry about it.

58
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,000
To be honest,
I completely forgot about it.

59
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,250
Thank you for
your forgiveness, Your Majesty.

60
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,167
What is this celebration for?

61
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,083
Could it be Mr. Max's birthday?

62
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,208
That's right, you don't know anything yet.

63
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:08,667
Why don't you take a look?

64
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,792
Enough already.

65
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:12,625
And then there's this video
that's all the rage.

66
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:17,042
Can you help find a way
to resolve it smoothly?

67
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,000
Due to the live broadcast a few days ago,

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,750
LATEST NEWS, BESKER KINGDOM
the relationship between the Kingdom and the Republic has changed significantly.

69
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,417
LATEST NEWS, BESKER KINGDOM
In response to changing public sentiment,

70
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:31,625
THE RESPONSE TO THE REPUBLIC HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
the government softened its attitude toward the Republic.

71
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,125
THE RESPONSE TO THE REPUBLIC HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
The government eventually agreed to make it an Autonomous Region.

72
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,542
THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC
That scared me.

73
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:40,958
MALE AGED OVER 20
But I'm glad it was resolved peacefully.

74
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:45,375
FEMALE AGED OVER 20
So the hero is so strong, it's amazing.

75
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,250
MALE AGED OVER 30
He's pretty cool. He's pretty cool when he's on his knees.

76
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,792
Mr. Max is really amazing.

77
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,875
He's very popular.

78
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,542
That's great.

79
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:14,250
It's no surprise that they could build
streets and fortresses with so few people.

80
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,833
Come, please have some.

81
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,708
Isn't our captain amazing?

82
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,542
Sorry, even the people
of our kingdom contributed.

83
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,375
What are you saying?

84
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,000
There's no distinction between
the Kingdom and the Republic now.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,458
After all, we are now the
"Kingdom Autonomous Region".

86
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:34,042
But are you willing to accept this?

87
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,917
Didn't you originally want to
create an independent nation?

88
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:42,875
None of us wanted to build a nation
or make things that big.

89
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,958
We're just trying to protect the land
we've worked so hard to create.

90
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:53,625
After all, the kingdom wanted to forcibly
expel us and confiscate this land.

91
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,250
They were willing to make a compromise,
for which we are already grateful.

92
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,750
But it's great

93
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,792
that people from both sides are working
together to pave the way to the kingdom.

94
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,625
There will definitely be many tourists,
including those from the kingdom.

95
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,000
Our proudest feature here
is the hot springs.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,958
The hotspring contains the magical ore's
power, which smooths your skin.

97
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,083
Once the work is done,
you should go and try it.

98
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,417
That's awesome.

99
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,042
This road has made a lot of progress.

100
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:29,708
It's just a little bit away from the town.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,375
Captain.

102
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,417
Should I start calling you "Region chief"?

103
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:40,000
No, that title doesn't suit me.

104
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:44,167
Your injury was so severe,
yet you can still move freely.

105
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,292
You had a big hole in your chest.

106
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,333
That was just a scratch.

107
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,500
Stop lying.

108
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,958
Didn't you have a time
when you couldn't move at all afterwards?

109
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,833
You're really undead.

110
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,333
That being said,

111
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:00,458
it was fortunate for the kingdom
that Max appeared

112
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,167
when I realized the power
of Hero and his gang.

113
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,500
If it was a one-on-one fight
between you and Fred,

114
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
you would definitely win, right?

115
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,792
That's hard to say.

116
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,500
But winning alone is not enough.

117
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,500
Because of them, we can shake hands
and make peace with the kingdom.

118
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,417
I couldn't have done it alone.

119
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,375
The hero is really amazing.

120
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,292
Come on, former Republic Gamma,
now Gamma Autonomous Region.

121
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,458
We still have a ton of work to do.

122
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,500
Let's get to work.

123
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:45,167
Can you help find a way
to resolve it smoothly?

124
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,250
It's news about Max again.

125
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,292
How many times are they going
to replay this kneeling video?

126
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,917
But everyone knows.

127
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:57,292
You are the one who fought
for the kingdom.

128
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:02,042
Chief, how is your condition?

129
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:05,708
If you need rest, please look at this.

130
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:09,417
A few days ago,
I found some very valuable data.

131
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,708
What valuable data?

132
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,583
What?

133
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,833
Then I will take my leave first.

134
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,000
Hello everyone, I'm Mackie.

135
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,542
Please subscribe to the channel
and like the video.

136
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,500
Today, we're going to put
this candy into the Coke.

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,667
The video and audio quality are terrible.

138
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:47,875
He is simply copying the contents
of others who overdo it.

139
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,208
And he's terrible at hosting.

140
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,708
Please subscribe to the channel.

141
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,250
Why is the video being shot
from such a distance?

142
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:02,500
SUPER DELICIOUS DESSERT REVIEW
Convenience store desserts are super yummy.

143
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,792
Feel free to contact me
for business cooperation.

144
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,125
It would be best
if a company commissions you.

145
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,583
Did you get me in the shot?

146
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,083
He actually forced
that woman to shoot a video.

147
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,667
That guy is absolutely terrible.

148
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,708
Your face is very scary.

149
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,292
I'm self-aware.

150
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,625
You should learn from me.

151
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,417
Today, I also provided a happy topic

152
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:39,042
out of jealousy for Max's commander.

153
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,833
The chief must be very grateful to me now.

154
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,167
Am I learning fast?

155
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,083
In all aspects…

156
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,417
I'm really something.

157
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,375
Stop shooting, stop shooting.

158
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,333
This is really unpleasant.

159
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,292
Gamma Autonomous Region?
Don't joke around.

160
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:18,750
There's no choice. After all,
we can't go against public opinion.

161
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,333
Public opinion, huh?

162
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,917
I can't stand it.
After a live video went viral,

163
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:27,500
everyone began sympathizing
with the hero and his team.

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,583
It's their fault that Tratigo bought
so many magical ore resources cheaply.

165
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,042
Alright, don't talk
about money hungry things.

166
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,292
What?

167
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,250
It's quite regrettable for you.

168
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,458
But I didn't expect Max

169
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,125
to have the backbone to stand up.

170
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,000
It makes me see him in a new light.

171
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,125
The kingdom's people are also waiting
for a chance to prevent this dispute.

172
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,083
Mr. Max just created a great opportunity.

173
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:02,083
Is it okay to make them an autonomous
region and give them special treatment?

174
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,917
They might get carried away
and rebel again.

175
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,667
No, don't worry.

176
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,417
Leo always returns favors.

177
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:12,000
He has always been like this
since he joined the army.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,208
Conversely, he also holds grudges.

179
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,292
That's why this happened.

180
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,458
Enough, quiet down.

181
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,000
Stop arguing,
let's continue the previous topic.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,583
It's not good
to let him stand all the time.

183
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,708
Right, Chief Fred?

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,417
Your fighting was very brave.

185
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,792
I saw it too.

186
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,250
So… Mr. Magic Bureau Chief.

187
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,708
Do you know that your actions and words
were recorded by a drone?

188
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,458
I know.

189
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,500
Then why didn't you destroy
the drone immediately?

190
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,542
I thought it was a bird
or something at the time.

191
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,333
You bastard.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,042
Even if we ignore that,

193
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:56,125
your magical attack seriously
injured Captain Gelmof.

194
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,375
I can't ignore this.

195
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,708
But later he fought with Max and Leo,

196
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,083
contributing to the peaceful resolution
of this incident--

197
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,917
No, Max alone was enough, right?

198
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,833
You're so stupid.

199
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,958
If it wasn't for Leo and Fred fighting,

200
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,583
Max definitely wouldn't have stepped in.

201
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,250
This time, it's the credit
of all the members of the hero team.

202
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,833
Right, Fred?

203
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,292
From the moment I attacked the captain,

204
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,708
I was prepared and willing
to accept any punishment.

205
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,250
And as the second minister said,

206
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,125
I didn't make
any contribution in this incident.

207
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,250
We are asking you
to vacate the position of chief.

208
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,125
I have no objections.

209
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,542
But it's not just about this.

210
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:44,250
There's also the "accident" of
the magic bureau explosion a few days ago.

211
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh my.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,083
I was convinced it was Republic Gamma
launching a terror attack,

213
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,583
but it turned out to be
a botched magic experiment.

214
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,333
This isn't funny, Minister Gremes.

215
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:02,208
I even told the media,
"We will never forgive terrorists."

216
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,208
For the Republic, the Kingdom
appears to be deliberately fighting.

217
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,667
But Leo didn't question this.

218
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:13,500
For us, it's a big favor.

219
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,125
Let me ask you, Fred.

220
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,500
Do you have any clues about that accident?

221
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I don't understand what you mean.

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,167
Never mind.

223
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:29,125
I heard Gremes say
that you've been quite anxious lately.

224
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,042
It's understandable
that you're eager for a resolution

225
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:36,708
after confronting your former companion
and facing uncertainty.

226
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,542
I see.

227
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:48,583
Blaming the whole mess on
a man with no value.

228
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,958
You're all so wise. Do as you please.

229
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,958
You really are impatient.

230
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,625
What? What's wrong?

231
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,458
Minister Gremes,

232
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,167
your warrant has been issued.

233
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,917
No. Wait. Why?

234
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:27,333
Because the explosion was Fred's doing.

235
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,167
Me? Why? It wasn't me.

236
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,250
Do you have evidence to prove
that I caused the explosion?

237
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,542
What are you talking about?

238
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,250
Your suspicion is embezzlement.

239
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,125
Em…

240
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:47,125
An unknown person sent data
to mailboxes all over the world at random,

241
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:52,000
LEDGER
including the Kingdom's Magic Bureau's financial information.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,333
FROM HERE TO THERE
It shows that a part of the Magic Bureau's budget

243
00:13:55,333 --> 00:14:01,125
was transferred to your account
through a virtual account.

244
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,958
We have checked with
the Magic Bureau's database.

245
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,417
This matter is confirmed.

246
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,042
Could you please come with us?

247
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,000
Really, it's so pathetic.

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,833
We have such a fool among
our nine ministers of the Kingdom.

249
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,708
You dare to say that I'm greedy.

250
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,042
You're the least qualified
to judge me, Gremes.

251
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:27,417
Just give up.

252
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,875
You should be grateful to just be
accused of embezzlement.

253
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,875
Fred, this…

254
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,708
It can't be you who did this, can it?

255
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,333
Who knows, I don't know anything.

256
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,375
Really, I've been set up.

257
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,125
I didn't expect to have to leave
the stage in such a boring manner.

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,167
But Fred, this is amazing.

259
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,667
In the end, you
and your companions escaped death.

260
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:06,042
You also avoided a full-scale war.
Congratulations.

261
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,833
War is truly disgusting.

262
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,333
Yeah. People who are still happy
about going to war must be

263
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:17,875
greedy people like you,
who profit from the misfortunes of others.

264
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,583
Yes.

265
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,083
After all,
some people can profit from war.

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,458
Those who profit from this, however,

267
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,250
may not be mere humans.

268
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,708
These chats are actually secondary.

269
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:39,792
Fred, my original intention

270
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,750
was to help you develop into a real man.

271
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,583
Change the hesitant you
by freeing yourself

272
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,417
from the monotonous past
of companions and so on.

273
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,833
Goodbye, everyone. Take care.

274
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,542
It's over.

275
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,750
After all,
Gremes had endless negative rumors.

276
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,417
It was about time he got his retribution.

277
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,875
I didn't hear anything.

278
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,625
You're too honest, so your words
and actions are going to reveal it.

279
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,208
Sorry for excluding you.

280
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,167
I'd also like to know

281
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,417
what this farce is all about.

282
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:22,375
Do you think Minister Gremes was behind
the explosion at the Magic Bureau?

283
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,167
What are you talking about?

284
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,208
I thought it was said to be an accident.

285
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,333
Or are you saying

286
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,250
you're convinced Gremes is behind it?

287
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,417
No, let's leave it at that.

288
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,875
After all, he's been very kind to me.

289
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,042
It's a pity.

290
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:44,042
Didn't you intentionally leak those
documents to expose Gremes' embezzlement?

291
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,667
You're really quite something.

292
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,583
No, I didn't do anything.

293
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,167
What's wrong?

294
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,958
Nothing, I'm sorry.

295
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,833
I just thought of something funny.

296
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,333
So gross.

297
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,250
So, I've played along
with you for so long.

298
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,167
You should fulfill my request now.

299
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,208
Of course.

300
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,625
I had planned it this way
from the beginning.

301
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,458
Fred,

302
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,333
we now have a vacant seat.
It's quite a headache.

303
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:23,792
You saved the kingdom again ten years
after the demon clan battle.

304
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,083
You deserve the position
of the new minister.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,542
Although Gelmof will likely be indignant.

306
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,083
So that's what it's all about.

307
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,125
The video of the hero kneeling
has over ten million views.

308
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,458
It's so funny.

309
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,917
Really, if I'd known,
I'd have stayed on my knees.

310
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,833
It makes it hard for me
to enjoy a can of beer in the park.

311
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,875
That's my only pleasure.

312
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,583
Hello, Mr. Max.
We are from FREEDAY Weekly.

313
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,333
I'm from Manchu Daily.

314
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,708
-I'm from Women's Autonomy.
-I'm from Weekly Spring Equinox.

315
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,542
Due to your active performance
a few days ago,

316
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,292
you are now highly praised
within the kingdom.

317
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,750
What were you feeling when you knelt?

318
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,417
What's your reason
for not favoring Leo or Fred?

319
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,583
You seem to be unemployed at the moment.

320
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,792
What are your plans for the future?

321
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,417
You guys are such a nuisance.

322
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:23,667
I'm busy, don't shoot without permission.

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
He flew away. He is indeed a hero.

324
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,042
-Quick, shoot it.
-Go after him.

325
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,292
Really, such a fuss.

326
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:35,167
But it's good
that peace has been restored.

327
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,708
Yuria,

328
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,667
do you want me to take care of him?

329
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,833
Is that so? Then I'll leave it to you.

330
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,750
Max serves.

331
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,583
You're too naive.

332
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:51,208
I'm back.

333
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,917
What are those reporters up to?
They've wasted my energy.

334
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,042
You're back, Max.

335
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,458
It seems you've managed
to escape the media siege safely.

336
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,333
How did you know?

337
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,375
We saw it on TV.

338
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,500
Really?

339
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,000
Max is exhausted,

340
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,250
so tonight we'll have the recently
trendy Top Energy Don for dinner.

341
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,625
Good idea.

342
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,042
I want more garlic…

343
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,958
How long do you plan to stay here?

344
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:21,042
Also, you and I are enemies,
so it's strange that you live here.

345
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:22,375
Get out of here right now.

346
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,833
Anyway, the issue with
the Republic has been resolved.

347
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,583
And I've been resurrected.

348
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,708
What kind of joke is that?

349
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,292
You just had a little fight.

350
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:32,125
It doesn't count
as the resurrection of the hero.

351
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,875
You're far from
the light you used to emit.

352
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,417
I still need to take care of you.

353
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,250
Why would you jump to that conclusion?

354
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,875
If His Majesty has such a plan,

355
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,125
then I will continue to stay here.

356
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,583
As a secretary, I must ensure
the safety of His Majesty.

357
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,042
I won't do anything.

358
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,500
Anyway, you get out now.

359
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,875
This is my room.

360
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,750
Are you sure you want to say that, Max?

361
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,417
Then you'll never taste
the Top Energy Don I cook.

362
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,833
Not just that,

363
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,792
there's also hamburger steak,
chicken leg, pizza, and cake.

364
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:07,667
Cook it today and leave.
You said you'd cook.

365
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,542
All I want to do now
is eat Top Energy Don.

366
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,375
You still have a long way to go.

367
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,583
I thought you guys were leaving.

368
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,417
Then let's toast to our reconciliation.

369
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,833
No, I don't want to drink with you again.

370
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,667
Don't worry,
I won't make the same mistake.

371
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,542
I don't want to, not even if I die.

372
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,792
Please forgive her, hero.

373
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,750
Everyone makes mistakes.

374
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:34,875
Hero. Max. Scandal.

375
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,208
Stop it.

376
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,333
Then I'll take the picture.

377
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,125
Sorry, I blinked again.

378
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,708
Again? Leo, have you had enough?

379
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,875
Anyway, I wasn't posing well just now.

381
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,167
Okay, perfect.

382
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:00,500
Wait.

383
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,917
Then I'll make this pose. Or this?

384
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:04,667
No.

385
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,208
-Then like this.
-Come on, just take the picture.

386
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,042
Okay.

387
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:11,500
Come.

388
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,875
Smile.

389
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,042
With this, the journey of the hero
has come to an end.

390
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:25,500
Although it was tough along the way.

391
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,875
We've made it through.

392
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,417
I won't see you guys again.

393
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,333
This is what they call "peace", right?

394
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,875
Well, everyone, good job.

395
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,000
Be careful on your way home
not to get attacked.

396
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,042
Well, everyone, till we meet again.

397
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,042
