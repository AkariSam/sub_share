1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:02,792
Hero, have you had enough sleep?
Get up now.

2
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,625
Breakfast is ready.

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:12,083
You're too laid back. Max.

4
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,042
Max?

5
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,792
Is he not breathing?

6
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,917
Hey… Hero, pull yourself together.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,792
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

8
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,083
(Episode 2: Watch out for the Glasses Girl)

9
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,750
Are you going out?

10
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,708
Where are you going?

11
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:13,958
I have some errands to run.

12
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,125
Be more specific.

13
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,875
Then I'll go with you.

14
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,167
Why? Don't come with me. So annoying.

15
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,958
What kind of attitude is that?

16
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,708
Is it so embarrassing to go out with me?

17
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't say the kind of things
only an old lady would say.

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,208
Who would dare take a demon out
and wander around?

19
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,208
Hide your third eye and horns
if you want to go out.

20
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,000
It's too suspicious.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,458
By the way, what does that guy usually do?

22
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,250
Is he going for special training
to fight me again?

23
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,167
I need to make it clear.

24
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,792
Right.

25
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,833
I'll use my best transfiguration magic
to hide my identity.

26
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,000
After all, transfiguration is the hobby
of the Demon Lord.

27
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:58,750
But what kind of appearance
should I change into?

28
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,500
Right, Zenia said
this outfit is a school uniform.

29
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,958
So it's most appropriate for me to change
into an age similar to a student.

30
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Transfigure.

31
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,875
Hmm, perfect.

32
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,292
If I let my guard down,
the magic might be dispelled.

33
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:32,792
I must be cautious.

34
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,333
In ten years, the human realm
has changed dramatically.

35
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,292
The number of skyscrapers has grown.

36
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,458
HIGH-PAYING PART-TIME JOB, MONEY LOVER
Transportation tools have also advanced.

37
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,625
-Welcome. What would you like to eat?
-Human technology is truly impressive.

38
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,958
-Please give me one.
-Human technology is truly impressive.

39
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,208
-So sexy…
-Look at that.

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,708
PRIVATE ROOM, 24-HOUR MOVIE APPRECIATION
What kind of shop is this?

41
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:04,042
I see. So humans can watch
movies in the shop.

42
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,417
But this kind of thing can be
watched at home too, right?

43
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,083
Damn Max.

44
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,375
Don't think you can hide from my eyes.

45
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,958
He should be nearby.

46
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,750
Found him.

47
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:18,083
Great, start following him.

48
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me reveal your secret,
you scumbag hero.

49
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,958
He goes into that shop.

50
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,208
He comes out immediately. What did he buy?

51
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:39,500
He starts drinking right away.

52
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,042
This is definitely not special training.

53
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,375
Is he planning to spend
the whole day like this?

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,417
Found him… Hey, hero.

55
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,042
What?

56
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,125
Hi.

57
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,458
That's great.

58
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,250
There are still people
who admire Max as a hero.

59
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,042
Let's play soccer, hero.

60
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,958
Again? I don't know what
to do with you guys.

61
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,583
You've started drinking again.
You're so useless.

62
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,250
Since you are tall, hero,
it is the three of us against you.

63
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,250
Alright, bring it on.

64
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,958
How is it? If you can snatch the ball,
then come and snatch it.

65
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,708
Hero, you're so cunning.
Don't be serious with kids.

66
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,458
Take this.

67
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,000
Ouch!

68
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,500
How dare you kick me!

69
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,125
Brat, take this!

70
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,375
Listen up.

71
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:50,750
Ten years ago, I did this, that, and this
to defeat the demon army.

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,833
Really?

73
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:57,167
At his age, it is not strange at all
to have such a big child.

74
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,917
Yosuke.

75
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,792
Oh no, it's my mom.

76
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,667
Hero, everyone, I'm sorry.
I have to go home.

77
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Take care.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,167
Um… I'm going home, too.

79
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,708
I see.

80
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:15,875
Actually, my mom told me
not to play with the hero.

81
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,500
You should listen to your mom.

82
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:26,792
My family did not say anything, so I will
play with you when I want. Here you go.

83
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:27,958
Thanks.

84
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,958
I'm leaving, I'll say hello
to mom for you.

85
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,250
No need.

86
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,750
Why doesn't he go home to sleep
if he wants to?

87
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,875
I can't stand it. I'll go home
and prepare dinner.

88
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,667
Old man.

89
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,625
If you sleep here, you will really bother
the people who live nearby.

90
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,542
Get up now.

91
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,958
What kind of reaction is that?

92
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,708
Stinky old man, stand up.

93
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,292
What do you want, brat?

94
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,375
Don't you know who I am?

95
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,125
Who would know?
You just seem like a suspicious person.

96
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,042
How can the authorities
let this kind of guy go free?

97
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,833
Let us show you how to
become a different person.

98
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,208
Come on, bring it on.

99
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,292
What, are you scared?

100
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,917
HERO MAX IS VIOLENT AGAINST CIVILIANS?

101
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,875
N-No.

102
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,833
Max, you must not fight back.

103
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,208
You guys aren't worth my fist.

104
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,542
Go home if you are satisfied now, brat.

105
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,958
You're quite cool, huh?

106
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,417
What a cool guy.

107
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,500
Go die.

108
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:53,875
People like you are a loss to society
simply by existing.

109
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,375
Apologize now.
Apologize to the world, you trash.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,542
Take this punch.

111
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,083
It's my hypnotic spell, Sleep Mind.

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,417
Don't worry, I didn't hurt them.

113
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,125
Since you were watching,
why didn't you help earlier?

114
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,333
Sorry.

115
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,250
I didn't mean to let you be humiliated.

116
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:31,917
It's fine, you understand now, right?

117
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,125
I'm not a hero anymore.

118
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:36,917
I am just a man who drinks
in the middle of the day,

119
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,042
brags in front of kids,

120
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,500
gets annoyed by those brats,
and cannot do anything about it.

121
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,542
In my heart, I am terrified.

122
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,042
I'm such an embarrassment.

123
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,500
That's not true.

124
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,333
I admire that you didn't fight back.

125
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,875
You're amazing.

126
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,208
Aren't you too lenient with me?

127
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,167
"Go home if you are satisfied now, brat."

128
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,125
You jerk.

129
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,375
I think you were cool.

130
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:10,000
Alright, let's go home and eat.
What should we cook?

131
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,833
I'll go somewhere else
and be back before dinner.

132
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,083
Where are you going?

133
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,333
I have some errands to run.

134
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,625
Really?

135
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,333
He's such a handful.

136
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,042
What do you want to eat?

137
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,875
Hamburger.

138
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,125
For the sides, let's do potatoes
and green beans.

139
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,333
We should still have
carrots at home, right?

140
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,542
Perfect.

141
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:44,500
But where did that hero go?

142
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,125
I hope he didn't go drinking again.

143
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,167
PRIVATE ROOM, MOVIE APPRECIATION

144
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,417
What's the deal with that woman?

145
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,125
Her outfit is so exaggerated.

146
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,625
I'm back.

147
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,125
Should we cook and eat now?

148
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,792
A ridiculously dressed woman
was just passing by.

149
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:41,000
Really? I didn't see such a girl.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,917
She was outrageous, almost naked.

151
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,750
Geez. How degenerate
has human society become?

152
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,000
It's done. Let's eat with gratitude.

153
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,917
Hey, why didn't you say "Let's dig in"?

154
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,792
Alright, let's dig in.

155
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,083
We have a guest.

156
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,042
Wait a minute. No sneaking bites.

157
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,750
You do not need to open the door
because it is most likely a salesperson.

158
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,250
Who is it?

159
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,250
Your Majesty… Thank goodness you're safe…

160
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,833
What? It's Zenia.

161
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,625
Didn't I tell you to wait in the castle?

162
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:24,583
You said you'd be right back
and had me prepare dinner.

163
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,042
Her appetite is still astonishing.

164
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,667
Even our dinner is going to be eaten up.

165
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,417
Your Majesty's cooking has the flair of
a demon realm ruler, as expected.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,625
She ate everything.

167
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,083
What can we do?

168
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,875
I'll go buy more food later.

169
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,583
It's getting more and more delicious.

170
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,833
Do you have any toothpicks?

171
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,042
What's with this woman?

172
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,083
I'm sorry for the commotion.

173
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,000
Her name is Zenia.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,375
She's my secretary.

175
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,208
A secretary? This kind of person?
Is she really capable of the job?

176
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,042
You are so rude.

177
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,083
I am a loyal servant to His Majesty.

178
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,000
With admiration for His Majesty, I, Zenia,
have walked for three days and nights

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,833
from the royal city through
mountains and rivers.

180
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,833
She actually walked here?

181
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:37,250
She must not have thought
about using human transportation.

182
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,792
This journey was extremely difficult.

183
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,833
People on the streets pointed
and whispered about me.

184
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,083
Some laughed at me, some frowned.

185
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,583
I face discrimination simply
because I am a demon.

186
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,750
No, it's probably because of your outfit.

187
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,125
Let's go, Your Majesty.

188
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,250
Please follow me back
to the city immediately.

189
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,292
Why are you suddenly saying this?

190
00:12:57,292 --> 00:13:00,583
Your Majesty, spending too much time with
this destitute hero may make you a fool.

191
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,042
Zenia,

192
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:06,125
How can you say that when you broke into
someone's house and ate there?

193
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:10,750
Besides, I am staying here to personally
experience human society.

194
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,417
This place is like a base for
gathering information.

195
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,333
Although you say that, Your Majesty,

196
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,333
I have already deduced
your true intentions, you are obsessed,

197
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,167
-no, infatuated with this useless man.
-U-Useless man?

198
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,167
Don't say it in such a harsh way.

199
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:26,583
I thought you would go home
after learning about the hero's situation.

200
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,292
I never thought
things would turn out like this…

201
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,833
Take him back with you, I don't mind.

202
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,958
What are you talking about?
You can't do anything on your own.

203
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,833
If I go back, you will die
right away, you life idiot.

204
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,125
I wouldn't die, you know.

205
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,250
Alright.

206
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,875
In that case,

207
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,958
I will sever Your Majesty's
attachment to the hero here.

208
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,958
Come on, hero. Prepare yourself.

209
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:50,833
She's even wearing
brass knuckles. Seriously?

210
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,000
Zenia's savagery is quite
a headache for me.

211
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,250
I thought she was good at magic.

212
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,833
Zenia has no talent for magic at all.

213
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,500
So that's why she walked here?

214
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,917
What are you two whispering about?

215
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,000
If you don't make a move, I'll attack.

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,208
You're her boss, do something to stop her.

217
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,000
Forget it, you can't beat him anyway.

218
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,333
Stop it.

219
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,625
Have you had enough, you shrew?

220
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,250
Don't you remember how many soldiers
like you I've defeated before?

221
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,542
Max,

222
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,583
she's still an unmarried girl.
Don't scare her.

223
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,708
Alright… I'm sorry.

224
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,167
You're also at fault, Zenia.

225
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,375
If Max really gets serious,
you won't end up well.

226
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,458
Okay, you should apologize now.

227
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,333
I-I'm sorry.

228
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,250
You really apologized. You're so honest.

229
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:49,292
Okay, His Majesty's interest in you
makes sense given your strength.

230
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,083
Even though you're an enemy,
you're still admirable.

231
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,625
Right?

232
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,333
What stance are these guys
taking while talking?

233
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,833
You're all sweaty, Zenia.

234
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:03,083
Yeah, I've walked a long way.

235
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,500
Do you want to take a bath?

236
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,250
Can I? Then please let me use it.

237
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,167
Won't you ask the house owner?

238
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,083
I'm sorry, my subordinate
has caused you trouble.

239
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,875
Yeah. Geez.

240
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,292
Her punch is really powerful.

241
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,333
It's probably 30 times the power
of those thugs from before.

242
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,875
If the opponent wasn't you,
it would have been dangerous.

243
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,833
You must be having a difficult time
with someone like her as your secretary.

244
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,042
Don't you have any other options?

245
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,917
Zenia may be a bit of a blockhead, but…

246
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,833
Her intelligence-gathering
ability is unquestionable.

247
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,583
She had a pretty good grasp
of your evaluation beforehand.

248
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:50,917
Your Majesty, thank you.
The hot bath was so comfortable.

249
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,792
Very good…

250
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,208
At least say thank you to me.

251
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,500
Although it's a bit shabby here,
you can rest well here.

252
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,833
You can take drinks from the fridge.

253
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,750
Thank you for your hospitality,
Your Majesty.

254
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,167
Whatever.

255
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,542
I'm so hungry.

256
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,583
That's true.

257
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,417
Well, I'll go get some food.

258
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:16,083
Zenia, you are a guest now.

259
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,667
You need to get along with Max, okay?

260
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,417
Y-Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,958
-Wait, take me with you…
-I'm leaving.

262
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,208
Uh…

263
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:34,750
I've also finished investigating
your love scandals so far.

264
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:40,167
You are reckless and flirting everywhere,
one after the other.

265
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,458
Listen up.

266
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,833
If you dare to put your evil hands
on His Majesty, I will not let you go.

267
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,625
What are you talking about? Nonsense.

268
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,458
Let me make it clear.

269
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,833
Do not think that just because you won
today means you have won against me.

270
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,000
If it weren't for His Majesty's presence,

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,583
I would have already punched you
into meat sauce.

272
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,875
Is that so?

273
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,542
Hey you.

274
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,625
What kind of attitude is that?

275
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,875
Listen to me carefully.
What kind of hero are you? Big dummy.

276
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,792
Why did you suddenly grab me?
What's wrong with you?

277
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,458
You can't escape. Hey.

278
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,625
Is that alcohol in your hand?

279
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,042
People who get drunk after
one drink shouldn't drink.

280
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,875
Stop drinking. Stop it now.

281
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,292
You're so noisy. Jerk.

282
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,875
S-Sorry, I didn't mean to.

283
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,333
Please do not sue me, I beg you.

284
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,292
Where is the tea?

285
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,000
It hurts.

286
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,583
You're pretty bold, huh?

287
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,792
Are you prepared?

288
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,375
I get it already!
Let's have some tea first.

289
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,958
And you should put on some clothes.

290
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,708
Go die.

291
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,583
What's with this speed?

292
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,958
Shoot, she's going to break the house.

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,625
Stop right there.

294
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't chase me!

295
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:37,750
Go put on your clothes, idiot.

296
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,583
That person is naked. It's so strange.

297
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,750
Don't look.

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,417
Don't you think he looks familiar?

299
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,417
So funny.

300
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Why is it so noisy?

301
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,208
Given that you are already drunk,

302
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,083
your body must be out of control, right?

303
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,500
Don't underestimate me.

304
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,625
I told you I'd turn you into meat sauce.

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,250
Is that so?

306
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,250
Well, then I won't hold back either.

307
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,750
I will show you the true power of a hero.

308
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,708
Excuse me for a moment.

309
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,542
How can you run naked in the streets?

310
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:42,208
Can I ask you a few questions?

311
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,417
I am sorry, I am truly sorry.

312
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,125
It's such a headache.

313
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,375
Why is she not wearing clothes
but wearing brass knuckles?

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,833
Are you okay? She was pursuing you.

315
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,667
I'm fine…

316
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,625
Well, I'm sorry.

317
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,250
Actually, I know her.

318
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,167
I gave her some alcohol
and she got excited.

319
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,833
The brass knuckles are mine too,
I'm really sorry.

320
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,333
I'm so sorry for causing you trouble.

321
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,500
Don't worry about it.

322
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,458
Mr. Max,

323
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,458
you were very active ten years ago.

324
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,083
It's because of you that
we have the world we have now.

325
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,667
I'm truly grateful.

326
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,375
You recognized me, huh?

327
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,042
I'm sorry that I'm like this now.

328
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:47,083
Please allow me to apologize again
for what happened last night.

329
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,208
My subordinate caused such a mess.

330
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,792
Don't worry about it.

331
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,958
Did she go back in the end?

332
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,375
To tell you the truth…

333
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,583
Here it comes.

334
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,250
What's up? Did you order something?

335
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,250
I'm Zenia from room 205.

336
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,750
I just moved next door,
so I came to say hello.

337
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,167
Are you done with the procedure?

338
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,375
Yes, I applied for immediate occupancy.

339
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:15,292
What did you say? You moved here?
And staying next door?

340
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,167
Even after what happened yesterday,

341
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:21,292
I still do not trust you.

342
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,208
If something happens to His Majesty,
it would be terrible.

343
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,625
So I will be along to monitor you

344
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,250
and collect information about
the human realm along the way.

345
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,500
Is gathering information
just a side thing?

346
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,375
Excellent.

347
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,042
This apartment will be the stepping stone
for future invasions.

348
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,750
Please spare me.

349
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,208
I hope we can get along, Your Majesty

350
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,458
and Mr. Max.

351
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,958
Is this woman from the demon clan?

352
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,583
Pretty interesting, Mr. Max.
