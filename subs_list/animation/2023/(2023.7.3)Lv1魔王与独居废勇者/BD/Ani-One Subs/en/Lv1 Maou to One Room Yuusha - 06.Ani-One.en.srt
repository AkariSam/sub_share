1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,792
That's it, Max.

2
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,792
Ifinidin Oplibion Nebila.

3
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,083
Chaos theory observation cycle.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,917
The sphere will become
a galactic whirlpool against the current.

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,208
Its orbit will not be bound
by physical laws,

6
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,625
it will turn into a comet and attack you.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,208
Are you hitting to the right?

8
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,333
Too bad, you guessed wrong.

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:34,333
I have won. You were destined to treat me
to coffee milk from the start.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,792
Wh-What? He hit it back!

11
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,208
He even used Nebila,
which is the cycle's rotation.

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,708
But…

13
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:47,042
it's all just child's play after all.

14
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,417
Oh no, I broke the ball again.

15
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,583
No matter how many balls there are,
they're never enough for you.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,792
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

17
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:32,333
(Episode 6: Battle at the Border)

18
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,125
Sweating feels good.

19
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,792
Speaking of which, soaking in hot springs
is extremely relaxing.

20
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,708
After all, we usually
use a small bathroom.

21
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,542
And here we can stretch our legs.

22
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,833
We definitely made the right decision
by coming here.

23
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,625
Yeah.

24
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,333
Max, are you there?

25
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,750
I'm here.

26
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,833
Can you bring me a large towel?

27
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,500
I accidentally left it over there.

28
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,292
I'll leave it here.

29
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,792
Could you bring it in for me?

30
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,708
I can't possibly walk
into the room all wet, can I?

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,583
I really can't deal with you.

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,792
Then I'll open the door.

33
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:20,458
I'm sorry, Max.

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,583
Here, open your mouth.

35
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,583
Stop messing around.

36
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
We don't need that.

37
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,458
I had so much fun.

38
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,417
What were we originally here for?

39
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,292
Attention all pedestrians,

40
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,167
we are the Republic's patrol team.

41
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:24,292
The border area between the Kingdom
and the Republic is currently off-limits.

42
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,083
That woman is from last time…

43
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:31,833
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,
please cooperate.

44
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,417
Furthermore, except for the direction
towards the border,

45
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:39,500
all other transportation options
are available as usual.

46
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,917
We are the Republic's patrol team…

47
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,500
She doesn't seem to have noticed us.

48
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,750
Of course not.

49
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,750
Does her mention of the border imply
a dispute with the Kingdom?

50
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,667
Is it okay? That's scary.

51
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,958
Is a war imminent?

52
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,000
We should leave soon
because things are not looking good.

53
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,958
Old lady.

54
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:07,250
You don't have to worry.
This is all routine.

55
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,833
They occasionally fight near the border.

56
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,417
Eat it…

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,167
Look,

58
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:17,500
the shops and the locals
are all very calm, right?

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,958
We've long been used to it.

60
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,125
Indeed.

61
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,917
This is what's called
normalizing bias, right?

62
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:25,542
Eat up…

63
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,375
This might be a good opportunity.

64
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,792
Alright, let's head to the border, Max.

65
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,292
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

66
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:39,708
This is a good time to assess
the Kingdom and Republic's strength.

67
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,167
And upon reflection,

68
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,792
we haven't done any reconnaissance
since we arrived.

69
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,917
Nonsense. Go by yourself.

70
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,000
I want to go home.

71
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,667
The return ticket is in my hands.

72
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,083
Even if you want to go home
with a teleportation spell,

73
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,667
only I can cast Teleportal,
so you should give up.

74
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,125
You bastard.

75
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,042
Speaking of which,

76
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:02,250
how do you plan to get to the border?

77
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,000
You're not going to walk
all the way, are you?

78
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,417
Leave it to me.

79
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,167
-Yeah!
-Come on, smile.

80
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,708
I'm in top form today.

81
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
Is it because I soaked in the hot spring?

82
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:23,333
Let's fly to the border in one go.

83
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,167
So heavy.

84
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,917
I'm exhausted.

85
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,542
Geez. You're such an overweight luggage.

86
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,792
Who told you to sleep after eating?

87
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,000
You've put on weight.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,375
Because the recent meals
have been delicious…

89
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,792
Just kidding.

90
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,250
That simple stone wall
is the border, right?

91
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,542
Let's stand by and watch, Max.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,125
Let me see.

93
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,458
Fire.

94
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,833
Their way of fighting is always the same.

95
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,458
Yeah, so I asked the captain
to go fishing.

96
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,625
It would be even more dangerous
if we let the captain act rashly.

97
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:19,958
In return.

98
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,042
Take this.

99
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,750
Pull yourself together.

100
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,583
What is that toy?

101
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,500
It's a weapon that can launch magic.

102
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,250
Even humans who can't use magic

103
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,375
can use it for combat.

104
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,500
It's totally ineffective.

105
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
It's just like child's play.

106
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,500
If it were demon armies,

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,083
we could simply tear through
the stone wall like paper.

108
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,583
Indeed.

109
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,875
Leaving the Republic aside,
I don't think the magical weapons of

110
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:01,250
the Kingdom wouldn't be able
to break through such a wall.

111
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,000
The bombardment seems to be ineffective.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,375
Of course, I know.

113
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,375
Damn it.

114
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,917
Perhaps the enemy has cast
a high-level defense spell.

115
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:12,958
Impossible.

116
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,250
They don't have such
outstanding magic experts.

117
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:20,042
Or they have set up
a powerful magic device.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,375
A magical bombardment
with a sleep or paralysis spell

119
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,250
is also hard to deal with.

120
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,250
Although the enemy seems to have
no intention of killing our troops…

121
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,875
So what?

122
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,708
No, never mind.

123
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,208
If we continue to fire magic cannons
at each other, it will never end.

124
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,958
I have an idea.

125
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,125
What?

126
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,542
They've started to retreat.

127
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,250
Deladora, good job.

128
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,875
They retreat so cleanly.

129
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,250
Is anyone injured?

130
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,875
No.

131
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,083
Big sister, what should we do next?

132
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,792
Anyway, we'll stay here
and keep watch until tomorrow.

133
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,583
We also need to report to the captain…

134
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,000
Big sister.

135
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,792
Will, don't freeze.

136
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,292
Get down, prepare for battle.

137
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,542
It's okay, I'll stop
the bleeding right away…

138
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,167
My hair is ruined.

139
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,333
Shut up.

140
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,750
I can't believe it.

141
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,875
It actually penetrated this wall.

142
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,500
How is it, have you solved it?

143
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,917
I hit one of them in the arm.

144
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,292
Fire the next quickly,

145
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,667
or they'll escape.

146
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,792
Please let me concentrate.

147
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,333
I will need a lot of magical power to

148
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,250
break through that wall's defense spell.

149
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,792
Let them flee if they want
and leave the empty city.

150
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:52,667
We can slowly dismantle the empty city
and fill the moat.

151
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,500
That magic just now was quite powerful.

152
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,667
It seems they also have experts
with great skills among them.

153
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,708
Finally, it's getting interesting.

154
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,583
Here it comes.

155
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,250
Yes, it's coming…

156
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,125
What are you looking at?

157
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,083
That is…

158
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,833
Captain.

159
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,208
Leo.

160
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,250
It's here…

161
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,333
Why is he always naked?

162
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:42,333
I felt the evil magic aura,
so I rushed over.

163
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,042
Did I overthink it?

164
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,792
General Leo.

165
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,125
What are you still doing?
Prepare for bombardment.

166
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,667
Only you…

167
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll never forgive you.

168
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,875
How is this possible?

169
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,708
Great, charge!

170
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,708
He really is childish.

171
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,333
The captain is indeed amazing.

172
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,375
Super strong.

173
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,417
That wasn't magic, was it?

174
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,750
You monster.

175
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,292
Captain Gelmof.

176
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:48,292
You took excellent care of me
during my time in the kingdom's army.

177
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,583
But if the kingdom's army
continues its ways,

178
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,750
we will not compromise either.

179
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:56,042
Your resistance is meaningless.

180
00:11:56,042 --> 00:12:00,375
The Kingdom will attack again.

181
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,208
The Kingdom will never agree

182
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,458
to the peace talks you seek.

183
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,083
Captain, this is what you taught me.

184
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,292
We must not give up,

185
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,083
no matter how long
and difficult the road ahead.

186
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,583
You know nothing at all.

187
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,875
The commander was so troubled
because of you, you bastard.

188
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,542
You are the commander's nightmare.

189
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,750
As long as you're dead…

190
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,583
That hit, didn't it?

191
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,250
A perfect hit.

192
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,083
Go back and tell Fred,

193
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,125
let's have a frank talk.

194
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,000
So you don't have to worry about it.

195
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,292
So, Captain,

196
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,625
please go back today.

197
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,667
Get out of my sight!

198
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,542
Captain!

199
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,000
What's wrong, big sister?

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,083
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

201
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm fine, it's just a minor scratch.

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
Don't push yourself too hard.

203
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,125
Are you sure you're okay?

204
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,833
I'm fine…

205
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,750
Thanks, Captain.

206
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,292
We couldn't contact you in time,
but you arrived just in time.

207
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,083
I felt a peculiarly eerie aura of magic.

208
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,000
Aura of magic?

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,458
Are you talking about that bald sorcerer?

210
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,542
No, I don't think it's him.

211
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,458
It appears that I was simply overthinking.

212
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,917
It's fine, everything ended well anyway.

213
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,458
-What's with your head?
-Enough, drop it.

214
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,333
You look more manly like this.
Why not take off your sunglasses too?

215
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:12,167
The sharp moves were admirable.

216
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,583
He's truly Leo.

217
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,958
A country's ruler should be
as strong as him.

218
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,833
Don't force your ideals onto others.

219
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,417
We realized again why the Republic Gamma
can compete with the Kingdom.

220
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,125
But on the other hand,

221
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,250
this is equivalent to relying on
Leo's combat power alone.

222
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,083
I wonder how long they can hold on.

223
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,208
How about it, Max?

224
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,167
Would you have a chance of beating Leo

225
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,875
if you fought him right now?

226
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,458
Are you kidding me?

227
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,833
I'm not even close to his level right now.

228
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,583
That's not necessarily true.

229
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,458
Are you satisfied now, Your Majesty?

230
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,875
We can go back now.

231
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,042
You're right,

232
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,667
I have witnessed Leo fight.

233
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,625
Let's go back today.

234
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,208
You should thank me,

235
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,667
thanks to my teleportation spell,

236
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,542
we can get home in a blink of an eye.

237
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,792
Did you bring everything?

238
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,167
No problem.

239
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,708
Move a little closer to me.

240
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,292
Teleportal.

241
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,417
Teleport quickly!

242
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,333
He's catching up.

243
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,667
What happened?

244
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,542
Leo found us.

245
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,250
Teleport quickly!

246
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,792
Wait, I can't concentrate on the spell.

247
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,500
Stop right there!

248
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,333
He's here.

249
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,833
That spine-chilling magic aura.

250
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,625
You're not a human,

251
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,542
you're the Demon Lord's
subordinate, right?

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,083
We can't escape.

253
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,458
Your judgment is wise.

254
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,458
You're skilled, state your name.

255
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,292
Is it because of those glasses?

256
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,542
Thanks to those,

257
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,333
Leo didn't recognize you as Max.

258
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,042
I-I see, I forgot about that.

259
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,167
It's your voice.

260
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,167
Don't suddenly speak in my head.

261
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,292
I had no choice.

262
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:22,417
It would be terrible if Leo heard us.

263
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,292
Why aren't you speaking?

264
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,542
I asked you to state your name.

265
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,208
Although I think you're probably a spy
sent by the Kingdom.

266
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,708
Quickly think of a way
to bluff your way out.

267
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,208
T-That's not true.

268
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,042
We were just passing by.

269
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,417
Your explanation is inadequate.

270
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,750
Damn, what do you want me to do then?

271
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,667
You said you were just passing by?

272
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,833
The roads to the border
should have been closed.

273
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,083
He actually believed it.

274
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,708
Honestly, I don't want to deal with you.

275
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,167
The problem is that guy,

276
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,292
he looks like a child, but I did feel

277
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,667
an inscrutable evil magic power.

278
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,625
Wh-What are you talking about?

279
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,875
This child is my child.

280
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,000
-M-Mom.
-What is it?

281
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,833
You actually brought a demon clan here.

282
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,583
What are your intentions?

283
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,500
If you continue to play dumb,

284
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,125
I won't show any mercy.

285
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,125
How about this?

286
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,125
Hand over that demon clan to me.

287
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,875
As long as you do as I say,
I will let you go.

288
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,917
Max, you should do as he says for now.

289
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:45,042
Don't worry,
I can use the teleportation spell.

290
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:47,708
As long as there's a chance,
I can escape at any time.

291
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:52,417
A chance? Do you think
he will show a vulnerability?

292
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,292
Don't worry.

293
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,125
Even if something unexpected happens,

294
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,042
as the demons, we can resurrect.

295
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,667
It's no big deal.

296
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,417
That's true.

297
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,250
Alright, hand me over to him.

298
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,417
At the very least,
I have to let you escape.

299
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,250
I don't want to.

300
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,875
Why should I listen to you,
long-haired man?

301
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,458
I like you.

302
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,292
I'll go distract him for
about ten seconds.

303
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,208
You take the chance to focus
and finish the teleportation spell.

304
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,125
You're indeed not ordinary.

305
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,625
You must never stop chanting
under any circumstances.

306
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,625
Hurry.

307
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,250
No matter what…

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
I won't stop.

309
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,958
Playing trick?

310
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,833
I won.

311
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,042
You are…

312
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,333
You actually dodged that kick.
Who are you?

313
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,042
You still can't tell? You must be kidding.

314
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,458
We did it, Max.

315
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,167
Fantastic.

316
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,042
What? Max?

317
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,708
You idiot, don't shout out my name.

318
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,292
I-I'm sorry.

319
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:58,833
Max? I see, no wonder.

320
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,875
Let's escape first.

321
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,208
Hold on, Max.

322
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,458
What are you up to?

323
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,417
Why did you come here? No,

324
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,583
why are you with the demon clan? You…

325
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,917
It's my privacy.
I refuse to answer any of it.

326
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:13,167
Long time no see.

327
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,917
I'm glad you seem to be doing well.

328
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,167
I see, so that's why…

329
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,833
So he is Max.

330
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,042
No wonder…

331
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,708
Exhausted.

332
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,375
We're home.

333
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,292
It hurts so much.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,208
We finally made it back safely.

335
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,167
This room makes me feel
inexplicably nostalgic.

336
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,000
Leo is incredibly strong.

337
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,125
Yeah.

338
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,292
But you're not any less impressive.

339
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,917
You fought brilliantly.

340
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,292
Did I?

341
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,625
A hot spring bath is really nice.

342
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,042
Is there something wrong, Your Majesty?

343
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,458
What's the matter?

344
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,750
-Max,
-Don't stare at me with the Third Eye.

345
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,167
What's going on with you?

346
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,333
You protected me.

347
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,000
I wanted to…

348
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,042
Thank you.

349
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,667
You're welcome.

350
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,875
Don't get me wrong.

351
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,750
If it were just me,
I could have escaped instantly.

352
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,208
Alright, alright.

353
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to kill you guys.

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,958
Hurry up and fix the paper door.

355
00:21:56,292 --> 00:22:00,042
Only now have I realized
this trip was quite enjoyable.

356
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:00,708
Right?

357
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,042
What nonsense are you talking about?
I'm not doing this anymore.
