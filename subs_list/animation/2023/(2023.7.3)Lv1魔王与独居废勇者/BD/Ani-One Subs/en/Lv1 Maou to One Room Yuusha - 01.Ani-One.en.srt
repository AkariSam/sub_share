1
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:32,542
Despite being enemies, I admire
your bravery and skill in battle.

2
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,792
But you should realize by now

3
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,417
that you will never be able to defeat me.

4
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:40,917
The human realm will fall
under the rule of us demons.

5
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:44,000
Damn it. Is this all that we can do?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,583
We must not give up, Fred.

7
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,167
In the end, let me send you off myself.

8
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,000
Protection!

9
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,458
Ridiculous!

10
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:33,792
Leo,

11
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,000
hang in there.

12
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,000
Yuria!

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,167
Strike Edge!

14
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,333
Charge!

15
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,708
Hero Max.

16
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:17,708
I am impressed you managed to beat me.

17
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,125
But unfortunately,

18
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:23,167
we demons possess seven lives.

19
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,625
I will resurrect.

20
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,500
And when I do, I'll make you pay in blood.

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
You should be looking forward to it.

22
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,875
And now,

23
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,500
I've finally

24
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,250
resurrected.

25
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,542
The detestable hero, Max,

26
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,750
prepare your neck for my vengeance.

27
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,875
Congratulations on
your resurrection, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,583
Long time no see, Zenia.

29
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,875
Are you the only one awake?

30
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,208
Where are the others?

31
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:03,792
The others have not awakened since
their battle with the hero ten years ago.

32
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:07,167
These guys are all the same. Geez.

33
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,333
By the way, have you grown taller?

34
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,542
Please put on some clothes first,
Your Majesty.

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,250
Zenia,

36
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,250
didn't I ask you
to bring my favorite clothes?

37
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:24,042
This is indeed the outfit you loved
to wear ten years ago.

38
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:26,583
But this is what you look like now.

39
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,875
It appears that ten years is insufficient

40
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,833
for you to amass sufficient magical power.

41
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,792
Your physical growth is also not complete.

42
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,708
And as you can see,
some important part of your body…

43
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,042
My muscular body is gone.

44
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:41,292
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,667
As your secretary,
I was prepared for this situation.

46
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:48,542
I have prepared a few outfits for you.

47
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,208
Zenia,

48
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,042
what are these clothes?

49
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:56,250
This is the traditional attire
of the sorcerers in human realm.

50
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,708
It's perfect for you.

51
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,250
I have never seen the hero's companions
wearing such airy clothing.

52
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,500
This is a maid's uniform
known as the "maid outfit."

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,292
Why do I have to dress like a maid?

54
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,917
This is what you wear to study,

55
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,042
and it has been widely
used for many years.

56
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,292
That's ridiculous.

57
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:14,958
Your Majesty,

58
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,125
nobody has used that phrase in ten years.

59
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,833
LOYALTY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
This one is for water activities…

60
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,375
DEMON LORD
This one is for water activities…

61
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,542
Enough!

62
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:25,583
Geez. You only bring me weird clothes.

63
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,375
I'm terribly sorry.

64
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,833
That's not your fault since your
usual clothes are also strangely awful.

65
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you talking about, scoundrel?

66
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,833
Speaking of that, Zenia,

67
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,917
how's that man doing now?

68
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,250
Who do you mean by "that man"?

69
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,958
Of course, I am referring to the hero
I despised the most, Max.

70
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,417
After all, that man had
the power to defeat me.

71
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:51,000
He must have become even better
over the past ten years.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,083
It is not surprising
if he is become a royal.

73
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,250
Tell me, Zenia. How is he doing now?

74
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,417
Um… to tell you the truth… actually…

75
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:02,458
It is unclear

76
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,667
what the hero's current situation is…

77
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,583
What?

78
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:10,042
At least, he has not made any
public appearance in politics or society.

79
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:13,042
Why? It's baffling.

80
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,083
Ah, I get it.

81
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,583
He must have been isolated from the rest
of the world, practicing day and night.

82
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,167
With a humble and sincere mindset,
he strives to save all sentient beings.

83
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,292
He is indeed a true hero.

84
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,375
I am looking forward to
our reunion more and more.

85
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:31,958
This way, Your Majesty.

86
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,125
During your slumber,
a lot of paperwork has accumulated.

87
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,417
Please forget about the hero for now.

88
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:40,250
How can I do that, Zenia?

89
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,500
The hero is our greatest enemy.

90
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,625
We cannot ignore him.

91
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,250
Please forgive my candor.

92
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,083
Even if the hero's strength
exceeds that of ordinary people,

93
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,417
he is still just an ordinary human.

94
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,542
He will soon age and die.

95
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,792
Your Majesty, there is no need to
obsess over such a person.

96
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,708
Are you hiding something from me?

97
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,417
Is there something about
the hero that you can't tell me?

98
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:12,500
H-H-How dare I hide something
from Your Majesty…

99
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,750
Could it be that

100
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,875
the hero has already died?

101
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,792
Did he die of illness?
Or was he assassinated?

102
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,500
Please tell me this isn't true.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,208
Your Majesty, please calm down.

104
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,958
I am going to confirm it right now.

105
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,583
The Third Eye!

106
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:32,125
This must be the life fluctuation
of the stinky hero.

107
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,875
Geez. He is clearly still alive.

108
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,500
Good grief. I got my hope up
for a moment.

109
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:37,625
DARK CONTINENT, DEMON LORD'S CASTLE

110
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,708
DARK CONTINENT, DEMON LORD'S CASTLE
He seems to be located near the royal capital of the human realm.

111
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,583
I see.

112
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:43,750
Okay.

113
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,542
I will go and come back quickly.

114
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,708
Where are you going, Your Majesty?
Please don't!

115
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,792
I'm just going to say hello today.

116
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,583
I will be right back,
so you go make dinner.

117
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,292
Your Majesty, please stay.
The hero is now…

118
00:06:58,542 --> 00:06:59,208
That's right.

119
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,708
The hero must now be at peace.

120
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,583
I want to declare my resurrection
by taking advantage of this opportunity.

121
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,833
I'll remind him of the taste
of terror and despair.

122
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,000
Please do not do that. You will be sorry.

123
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,375
Enough of that.

124
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,958
I woke up early for this very reason.

125
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,708
I will not yield on this point.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,083
Please wait, Your Majesty.

127
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,792
His Majesty is so excited.

128
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,333
Please forgive me for
not being able to stop you, Your Majesty.

129
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,042
I haven't been to
the human realm in a long time.

130
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,583
I'm almost there.

131
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,667
These shabby houses
where you foolish people live.

132
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,125
I see. Civilization is indeed more advanced
than that in my memory.

133
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,292
I'm getting closer.

134
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,833
What will the hero's expression be like

135
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,417
when he sees me resurrected
with his own eyes?

136
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,833
I can't wait to see that.

137
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,458
Is it that building?

138
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,208
Excuse me.

139
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,917
Long time no see, Hero Max.

140
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:17,375
Open your eyes wide and see. As promised,
I have finally resurrected.

141
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,958
What's wrong with you?
Too scared to speak?

142
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,917
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

143
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:04,333
(Episode 1: Resurrection of the Demon Lord!)

144
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,375
Who are you?

145
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,958
I'm sorry. It seems I got the wrong place.

146
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,667
I am Max.

147
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,125
Don't joke with me.

148
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,333
The third eye and the horn…
Are you a member of a demon clan?

149
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,958
What's the deal with the demon clan
coming to me at this point?

150
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,250
This is the Holy Sword Blaze Bringer.

151
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,542
There's no mistake.

152
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,667
It was with this sword that
you slashed my right shoulder.

153
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,417
Could it be that you're…

154
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:38,417
Oh, you said you would
resurrect or something.

155
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,417
Don't treat the holy sword like trash
and throw it around.

156
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,958
Sit properly, you little rascal.

157
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,500
You were the hero Max back then?
Is this true?

158
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,625
Didn't I say it already? My back hurts…

159
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,792
Your body and mind are completely relaxed.

160
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,083
Your chin is almost gone.

161
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,458
Stop nagging. This is a normal part
of the aging process.

162
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,500
You have changed so much in ten years
that you are almost a different person.

163
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,750
You have no right to criticize me.
Why are you wearing a sailor's uniform?

164
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,958
By the way, your room is too dirty.

165
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,958
And there's an odd smell.
Is it the smell of your room?

166
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,333
Enough, don't keep smelling.

167
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,542
Is this a container for food?

168
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,708
This must be discarded immediately
or bugs will appear.

169
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,667
There are so many tissues.
I cannot stand it. I'll help you clean up.

170
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,833
You have the nerve to pick up
someone else's tissues from the floor.

171
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,583
What is this?

172
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,875
There's a hole in it,
and it's very elastic.

173
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,333
Stop, don't touch my things.

174
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,458
Is this the device used by humans
to look for information?

175
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,292
I told you not to touch my things.

176
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,958
I can enter text here.

177
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,417
I see. This can be used
to gather information.

178
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,292
Humans really have their ways, don't they?

179
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,208
After all, why are you here?

180
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,292
I almost forgot.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,417
Hero Max,

182
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:05,542
your fangs have fallen out
after ten years of peace, haven't they?

183
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,458
I hereby announce that
I have completely resurrected.

184
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:13,750
This time, I will unquestionably
dominate all of you weak humans.

185
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,125
Can't you show me some reactions?

186
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:25,000
Your archrival is back. You can shout
"Do not even think you will succeed!"

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,375
There's no need.

188
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,958
Are you kidding me?

189
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:33,292
I woke up early to see
your regretful face before your death.

190
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,083
This has nothing to do with me.

191
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,750
You were full of vitality ten years ago.

192
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,125
What happened in these past ten years?

193
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,417
You want to know what happened?

194
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,000
It's simple.

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,542
Nobody needed me after I defeated you
and drove away the demon clan.

196
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:55,125
I lost my foothold without a decent medal
and ended up in such a predicament.

197
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,667
This is outrageous!
Humans are unforgivable.

198
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:03,042
What have they turned the hero
who saved mankind into?

199
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:08,292
A hero is a useless burden
in a peaceful world.

200
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,167
It can be said that
it is a bothersome presence.

201
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,542
But now it's so relaxing…

202
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,917
Searching for "Hero Max."

203
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,667
There's quite a lot. Let me take a look.

204
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,250
Don't look!

205
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,208
HERO MAX SUSPECTED OF STEPPING INTO OTHER'S MARRIAGE
SENT TO PROSECUTORS FOR INVESTIGATION AFTER ASSAULTING A CIVILIAN

206
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,208
Stepping into other's marriage…

207
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,958
It's not true! I didn't do that.

208
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,333
The press conference video
is still available.

209
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,667
Were you thinking with your lower half?

210
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:35,333
You were sweating.
You definitely did it, right?

211
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,792
I didn't! Listen to my explanation.

212
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,917
I didn't even know she was married.

213
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,125
I was framed!

214
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,333
She was a gold-digging hero hunter,

215
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,125
and her husband was definitely in it too.

216
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,750
It's your own fault.

217
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,625
You got caught because you like having fun
and do not take relationships seriously.

218
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,125
What's this article about?

219
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,667
What is it?

220
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,625
Assaulting a civilian?

221
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,042
Really? You…

222
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,083
I didn't do that!

223
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,792
That article made it seem like
I was the only bad guy.

224
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:08,292
It was clear that
six thugs suddenly attacked me.

225
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,792
Of course, I had to fight back
when something like that happened.

226
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,917
You should have been able to
escape easily in such cases.

227
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:17,792
Ten years ago, didn't you just escape from
the clutches of my undead legion?

228
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:21,167
But we both got injured that time.

229
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:25,125
You must have become
irritable because of drinking.

230
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,792
You're so stupid.

231
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,167
It's getting more and more interesting.
What else is there?

232
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,958
Enough, stop looking.

233
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,792
HERO MAX IS GOING ON DATES WITH TEN GIRLS AT THE SAME TIME
What?

234
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,917
You've actually fallen to
such a low point.

235
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,667
I didn't! Only this article has no facts
or evidence to back it up.

236
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,250
I don't remember
raising such a bad child like you.

237
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,875
What nonsense are you talking about?
Calm down, idiot.

238
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,417
I've denied it countless times.
I don't know any of those ten girls.

239
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,417
Yet they mocked me as
the "Explosive Holy Sword of the Night"

240
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:57,792
and "My Holy Sword Blaze Bringer is
invincible and sharp to the max."

241
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,333
Y-Your Holy Sword Blaze Bringer…

242
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,750
Well… didn't that improve
your nighttime reputation?

243
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,917
Shut up!

244
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,958
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH HERO MAX AFTER HE DEFEATED THE DEMON LORD
Do not be so depressed.

245
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,208
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH HERO MAX AFTER HE DEFEATED THE DEMON LORD
I'll find some of your cool moments.

246
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,833
It's true that I defeated the Demon Lord,

247
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,708
but it wasn't all on my own.

248
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,333
I was able to face the Demon Lord

249
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:23,250
with "the pride of a human being"

250
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,500
because of my irreplaceable companions

251
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,708
and the support of people
all over the world.

252
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:32,708
For me, defeating the Demon Lord was
an unavoidable process.

253
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:38,000
What can I, as a hero, do now to help
preserve this priceless peace?

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,708
I believe my future mission
is to always seek answers.

255
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,083
THE END

256
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,333
It's so stupid. You seem a bit
too full of yourself, don't you?

257
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,667
-Everyone has a hero in their hearts…
-I'm laughing so hard that it hurts my stomach…

258
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,333
Shut up! Stop looking at it!

259
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:59,125
Your attitude was so arrogant. No wonder
some people wanted to expose your secrets.

260
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,333
This is what they call "The bigger
the tree, the more wind it catches."

261
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,417
Go tell the "Max" from ten years ago.

262
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,917
And this is what you've become?

263
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,667
Isn't this a photo of your companions?

264
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,625
You appear to have preserved this photo
even better than the Holy Sword.

265
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,583
That's not true.

266
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,667
The toned physique.

267
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,542
The direct gaze brimming with potential.

268
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:25,542
Where did the "Max" from back then go?

269
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,833
Your obsession with me is kind of creepy.

270
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,333
How are you getting along
with your companions?

271
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,292
We haven't seen each other
for several years.

272
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,875
The hero is so lonely.

273
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,250
It's always been like this.

274
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,750
Interests are required for the maintenance
of so-called interpersonal relationships.

275
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,917
What is the point of those guys
meeting me now if there are no benefits?

276
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,458
You're wrong.

277
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,292
Your companions have left you precisely

278
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,250
because of your selfish thinking.

279
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,958
You're so annoying. Shut up.

280
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,792
Don't act like you know everything.

281
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,583
Get lost. You're an eyesore.

282
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:02,208
Now I understand why
Zenia tried to stop me.

283
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:05,083
There is no hero here anymore.

284
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,333
I'm leaving. We probably
won't see each other again.

285
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,667
Get lost.

286
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,708
By the way,

287
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,625
since the hero has fallen,
humanity has no hope.

288
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,875
I will wake everyone up immediately when
I return. I need to reunite the army.

289
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,583
We'll see, humans.

290
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,667
I agree. It's better to just
let this world be destroyed.

291
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,750
But your companions are a bit in the way.

292
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,333
Why don't I attack them now?

293
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,708
That's a good idea.

294
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,750
I borrowed money from Leo.

295
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,917
As long as he dies,
I don't have to pay it back.

296
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,708
You! Go to

297
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,625
hell, right now!

298
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,250
It seems that
your skills haven't regressed.

299
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,625
Fool.

300
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,417
You wouldn't be able to defeat
those people right now.

301
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,792
I clearly…

302
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,167
Is this a closet?

303
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,833
The hero didn't give me a fatal blow.

304
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,833
Okay.

305
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,042
Hey you.

306
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,083
Can't you just bear with it for a while
while I'm still around?

307
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,750
Any objections? Just go to sleep.

308
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,583
Why didn't you kill me?

309
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,208
You could've done it if you wanted to.

310
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm not a hero anymore.

311
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,625
There's no point in defeating
the Demon Lord.

312
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,792
And if I were to defeat you now,
the next headline would probably be

313
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:59,708
"Hero Abuses and Causes the Death
of His Illegitimate Child."

314
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,667
That would be too much.

315
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,833
Have a cup of coffee.

316
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,875
It's bitter. Don't you have orange juice?

317
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,792
It's a waste to make coffee for you.

318
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,667
You're definitely a hero,
no doubt about it.

319
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,500
Why are you suddenly saying this?

320
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,167
Agile moves, excellent skills.

321
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,917
Your skills haven't declined at all.

322
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,875
I really felt the hero's
burning soul in your heart.

323
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,042
Say whatever you want.

324
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,833
To be honest, you're the one
who has regressed.

325
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:39,208
You are attempting to attack Leo and
the others at this level? What a joke.

326
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,042
Shut up. I just woke up and haven't
gotten into the groove yet.

327
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,625
Look. Even though
my body is in this state now,

328
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,458
I'll definitely make a comeback,
and take the human realm into my hands.

329
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,042
When the time comes,
you'll have to fight me again.

330
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,625
I'm sorry, but I can't promise you that.

331
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,583
As you said,

332
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,792
my current situation is all my own doing.

333
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,375
But

334
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,833
I'm truly fed up with this world.

335
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,958
I really can't muster
the energy to be a hero again.

336
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,542
And heroes are supposed
to be born of the times.

337
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,875
As long as you cause trouble,

338
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,333
a new hero will definitely appear.

339
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,208
Is that so?

340
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,208
I got it.

341
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,125
Sorry to bother you,
and thank you for your hospitality.

342
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,625
Goodbye.

343
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,542
Talking to you is a nice change of mood.

344
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:41,542
Bye.

345
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,208
I'll take a bath.

346
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,792
I'm back.

347
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,458
Lend me your kitchen.

348
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,750
Fortunately, I have money from
the human realm with me.

349
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,208
People even praised me, saying, "How kind
of you to help with grocery shopping."

350
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,667
You're probably malnourished.

351
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,083
I'll cook hot pot for you.

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,250
Wh-What are you doing?

353
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,875
You're scarier now than ten years ago.

354
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,500
Actually, after that,
I thought about it too.

355
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,667
It would be such a waste to
leave a man like you alone.

356
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:32,125
And human society has evolved.
I still have a lot to learn.

357
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,333
So I will be staying here for a while.

358
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,250
Are you kidding me?
I can't take care of you.

359
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,333
Take care of me? Don't get it twisted.

360
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,625
I mean, I'll take care of you.

361
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,583
You should be grateful.

362
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,667
How is it?
The hot pot is delicious, right?

363
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,333
How should I put it?
It is indeed delicious.

364
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:58,375
After all, I'm familiar with
the five major seasonings in cooking.

365
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:03,000
I'll master your stomach
before mastering the human realm.

366
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,167
From now on, I'll cook for you every day.
Be prepared for that.

367
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,625
It looks delicious.

368
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,250
Did you just say anything?

369
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,208
No.

370
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,667
Is that so? Then, let's eat.
