1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,708
This suit looks good, doesn't it?

2
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,375
It is what I just bought.

3
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,333
The shirt and tie as well.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,917
By the way, let us take
a photo as a memento first.

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,958
Please get to the point.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,417
Even though I have guessed it.

7
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:27,458
Nothing, actually I have a headache.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,042
The recent bombing attack has heightened
public hostility toward the Republic.

9
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,625
BREAKING NEWS: UNUSUAL EXPLOSION AT THE MAGIC BUREAU
public hostility toward the Republic.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,875
I can't stand it.

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:39,083
I have only recently begun encouraging
both sides to engage in peaceful dialogue.

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,500
Peaceful dialogue has been
a pipe dream from the start.

13
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:47,667
The Kingdom will never recognize
the Republic's claims or territories.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,792
What should we do then, Fred?

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,250
Doesn't this imply that the Kingdom
and the Republic will go to war?

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,542
But after all, the Republic has Leo.

17
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:05,750
We can't defeat them with ordinary means
as long as he is in the Republic.

18
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,375
As long as Leo…

19
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,167
As long as Leo what?

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,458
As long as Leo is gone, the Republic has
no way to stop itself from falling apart.

21
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,958
Yeah.

22
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,167
It is unfortunate, but now that
the situation has reached this point,

23
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:25,750
we must ask Leo to accept
responsibility and disappear.

24
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:30,292
But only you, the hero's companion,
are capable of doing so.

25
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,542
Max is no longer of any use.

26
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:33,792
HERO MAX HAVE TEN LOVERS AT THE SAME TIME
Max is no longer of any use.

27
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,542
Yuria has retired too.

28
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,458
I can handle Leo alone.

29
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,375
In the past,

30
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,917
even someone like me had
a so-called best friend.

31
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:50,958
He was my classmate in school, and we both
joined the Magic Bureau at the same time.

32
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:54,292
He had better grades than me.

33
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:57,458
He was increasingly successful.

34
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:02,333
But one day, I found
evidence of his corruption.

35
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,292
So I made it public.

36
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,125
Of course, he lost his footing
and fell apart.

37
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:18,750
Then you replaced that friend
and got promoted all the way.

38
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,417
You really know how to mock people, Fred.

39
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,417
But…

40
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,542
Now I'm completely an old man.

41
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,375
I would probably solve things
like that privately.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,958
That being said,

43
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,958
I don't think what I did then was wrong.

44
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,583
He took the wrong path.

45
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,750
So I corrected it.

46
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,667
That incident hurt me deeply.

47
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,167
I still dream about it occasionally.

48
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,458
Don't joke with me.

49
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:55,042
Do you think I will suffer as a result of
cleaning up after that filthy terrorist?

50
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,583
Impossible.

51
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,125
I will go alone.

52
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,417
You don't need to persuade me.

53
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,875
Thank you.

54
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,375
You must come back alive.

55
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,583
Not bad at all.

56
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,875
This man has truly won my heart.

57
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,417
Fred.

60
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,042
Your Majesty,

61
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,917
Regarding the analysis of that thing,

62
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,250
I hope you can give me a little more time.

63
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,250
Okay.

64
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,625
Let's just leave it at that.
It's a unique situation.

65
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,125
Max.

66
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,917
You really had a hard time yesterday.

67
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,125
Is your stomach feeling any better?

68
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:26,542
Max, I didn't know you were so distressed.

69
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,708
You even cried so hard.

71
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,667

What's wrong with you?

74

WE'RE SORRY THAT YOU DIDN'T WIN, NO REFUNDS
Who bets this way, are you stupid?

75
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,250
A jobless person risks
90 000 on a boat race.

76
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,833
Because… if I win,
I can get 40 times the amount.

77
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,417
You'd better win.

78
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:04,000
I got it, next time
I'll place a safer bet.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,625
Give me some pocket money.

80
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,917
I can only give you 50 000.

81
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,500
Your Majesty,

82
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,958
we don't have time to gamble now.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,208
Please take a look at the television.

EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE BESKER KINGDOM GOVERNMENT
The kingdom is adamant about not giving in to terrorists.

85
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,750
Our country has made
the difficult decision

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,417
to carry out the operation to
annihilate the Republic Gamma.

87
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:30,042
This really is causing
a public disturbance.

I still find it very scary.

PUBLIC OPINIONS ON THE GOVERNMENT
I hope this matter can be resolved soon.

90
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,083
By the way, what is the hero doing now?

91
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,333
Isn't the mastermind his companion?

92
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,125
A WOMAN IN HER 40S
In the end, they caused the war.

93
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,208
Shouldn't we hold that guy responsible?

94
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,583
Why?

95
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you think I'm their father
or something?

96
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:53,792
This is nonsense.

97
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,833
Mr. Max, where are you going?

98
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,292
I'm going for a walk.

99
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,458
I'm going too.

100
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,250
If I leave him alone, he might bet
100 000 on horse racing this time.

101
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,500
Bye.

102
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,833
Is there somewhere you would like to go

103
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,083
if you are going for a walk?

104
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,792
If I were to go alone,
there would be a place I'd like to go.

105
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,250
Then let's go there.

106
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,375
You don't need to worry about me.

107
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,208
I don't want to go.

108
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,500
PRIVATE ROOM, MOVIE APPRECIATION
What's with your tone?

109
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,875

Why won't you take me with you? Tell me!

110
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,875

Shut up.

111
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,333
PRIVATE ROOM, MOVIE APPRECIATION
In any case, it's not a place to go with other person.

112
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,958
I am a demon's companion, not a person.

113
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,750
Don't twist your words.

114
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,708
No means no, whether
you are a person or a demon clan.

115
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:57,625
Not a demon clan, you should say
"demon's companion".

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,958
I don't care.

117
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,750
I found you. Is she your girlfriend?

118
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,458
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

119
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,458
Oh, you are the kid who was
playing with Max the other day.

120
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,625
I apologize for constantly
bothering you to accompany him.

121
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,292
Indecent woman.

122
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,542
What?

123
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,250
What are you talking about
all of a sudden, you little brat?

124
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,917
Where did you learn such words?

125
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,833
Your way of speaking is strange.

126
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,250
What are you holding?

127
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,958
It's a badminton racket.

128
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,708
How are you going to play this alone?

129
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,833
Yeah.

130
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,250
So I'm looking for someone to
play with me. Will you play with me?

131
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,333
You're so much trouble.

132
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,750
Go find your friends.

133
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,833
Isn't it good, Max?

134
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,417
It's healthier than gambling.

I lost again.

137
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,167
You're so good, little girl.

138
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,750
Your social skills are terrible,
no wonder you can't get ahead.

139
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
She's so mean.

140
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,958
Is your mom doing well?

141
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,583
Yes, although her stomach is super big.

142
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,083
My little brother is about to be born.

143
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,042
Congratulations.

144
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:15,958
Here you go.

145
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,875
Big sister, join us too.

146
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,292
Do you want to play against me?

147
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,708
Alright, but I won't go easy on you.

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,708
No, no.

149
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,958
You play against Max.

150
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,875
I'll watch.

151
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,208
That's alright for me…

152
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:36,083
It would be problematic
if she discovered your power.

153
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,667
Just play around a little bit.

154
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,125
Of course, I know.

155
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,083
I'm going to serve.

156
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,958
Go.

157
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:54,458
Are you sure you want to maintain
the status quo and do nothing?

158
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,125
Your former companions
are about to go to war.

159
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,542
You're quite a nagging fellow.

160
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,833
Saying we're companions,
but that was ten years ago.

161
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,917
It has nothing…

162
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,833
to do with me.

163
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,750
Leo and Fred might both die.

164
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,792
Even so,

165
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,500
you still want to stay out of it?

166
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,792
What does it have to do with me?

167
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,792
They brought it upon themselves.

168
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,083
For me,

169
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,208
the outcome of gambling
is much more important.

170
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,000
You would never say something

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,042
like that ten years ago, would you?

172
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,917
Would you?

173
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,958
Humans…

174
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,375
can change drastically after ten years.

175
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,042
How could I always be a kid?

176
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:01,875
You monsters probably wouldn't understand.

177
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,000
Bastard.

178
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,083
Go to hell.

179
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,792
Impressive.

180
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,917
Worthy of the hero, I am a bit impressed.

181
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,375
Well, thank you.

182
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,625
"Play around a little bit"?
Yet you take it so seriously.

183
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,625
Don't you take it seriously too?

184
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,167
You think that's all I've got?

185
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,458
It looks like you, as the hero,
have also become a lot weaker.

186
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,208
Shut up.

187
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,292
Don't talk in my head, idiot.

188
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,625
What did you say?

189
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,667
By the way, I brought you a gift.

190
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,250
Here.

191
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,208
A candy?

192
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,458
Yes, someone told me to give it to you.

193
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,917
Big sister, can you teach me
the move you just did?

194
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,542
That was just a fluke.

195
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,917
That damned woman.

196
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,375
What on earth does she want me to do?

197
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,042
Max, be careful.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,083
Captain Gelmof.

199
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,958
We are ready to attack.

200
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,208
Listen, Fred,

201
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,250
you are not allowed to act on your own.

202
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,917
Let our attack army go first.

203
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,208
No need.

204
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,167
What?

205
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:45,875
Could the kingdom's army remain in place
and keep the media and public at bay?

206
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,250
Are you joking?

207
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,125
You're asking us to deal with the crowd?

208
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,042
That's how we can avoid
unnecessary casualties.

209
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,208
Don't underestimate us!

210
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,958
You and Leo are the same.

211
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,000
You never think about
who caused all of this!

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,250
Listen, I'm the commander
of this operation.

213
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,708
Shut up and follow my orders.

214
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,458
You bunch of psychos.

215
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,500
You're making a lot of noise.

216
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,042
I don't give a damn.

217
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,750
Wait, Chief, what are you doing?

218
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,792
Doing this, you will…

219
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,500
I will most likely lose
my position as chief.

220
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,750
But that doesn't matter anymore.

221
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,625
Let's end this, Leo.

222
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,833
Former Chief.

223
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,333
What is it, former subordinate?

224
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,208
You guys switched too quickly.

225
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:45,083
That city wall has
a powerful defense spell.

226
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,667
The kingdom's magical weapons,

227
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,833
didn't even leave a scratch on the wall.

228
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:53,917
Under these conditions,
the fortress is still unresponsive.

229
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,542
What is the Republic planning?

230
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,833
It seems unmanned.

231
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,833
Really?

232
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,250
They should know very well.

233
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,958
It's futile to keep guarding here.

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,917
That's a wise judgement.

235
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,250
Alright, this is my final order.

236
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,125
Don't let anyone pass through this ditch.

237
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,333
I-I'm going too.

238
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,833
Understood.

239
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,833
You've worked hard all this time.

240
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,667
Chief.

241
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,000
Since he can fly, is there a need
to destroy the city wall?

242
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,000
The wall separating

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,667
the Kingdom and the Republic

244
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:57,250
was just destroyed by a powerful impact.

245
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,042
It appears that both sides
have officially started the war.

246
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,250
But currently, the traffic here
is strictly controlled.

247
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,708
The situation in the Republic…

248
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,167
LIVE, BESKER KINGDOM'S BORDER
There seems to be another explosion of light.

249
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,625
BREAKING NEWS, FIGHTS AND EXPLOSIONS AT THE BORDER
Is this the magic of Chief Fred?

250
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,083
They have begun fighting.

251
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,417
Making such a big scene

252
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,750
is typical of the hero's
companions. Not bad.

253
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,458
Keep going, Fred.

254
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,250
As long as you win, it ends here.
That would be the best.

255
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:30,250
Defeat Leo and the Republic will collapse.

256
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,833
But even if Fred loses, it doesn't matter.

257
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,667
The "terror attacks launched
by the Republic" will still continue.

258
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:41,417
Tratigo's support for the Republic
in order to obtain resources

259
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,250
will most likely not be able to continue.

260
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,542
With Tratigo's withdrawal,
the Republic will be on its own.

261
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,917
Then, we just need to wait for
them to starve and die.

262
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,917
Having said that,

263
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,625
if Fred dies,

264
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,833
I will be very lonely.

265
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,708
Anyway, I'll just find another
more flexible person to be the chief then.

266
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,458
Your Excellency.

267
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,083
There's a big problem.

268
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,583
What? What's wrong?

269
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,000
I thought I was on vacation today.

270
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:18,167
There's no time for a vacation now,
someone is live broadcasting.

271
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,250
When you say "broadcast",
you mean what's on TV now.

272
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,625
No, look here.

273
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,708
What is this?
A live broadcast from PooCube?

274
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,958
LIVE
The Kingdom attacks Republic Gamma.

275
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,083
Live.

276
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,292
What is this?

277
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,833
Why would anyone capture this?

278
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,542
Wasn't the media blocked outside the wall?

279
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,083
Where are you looking, Fred?

280
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,417
Don't underestimate me.

281
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,458
Fred is so strong.

282
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,875
What is this?
Which TV station captured it?

283
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,833
Who knows, isn't it from your side?

284
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,333
How do you watch this?

285
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,208
Don't you use social media?

286
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,167
Are you kidding me?

287
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:11,375
Since the situation is live on TV,
we cannot escape if something goes wrong.

288
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,750
Quickly block the channel, shut it down.

289
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,125
No matter how many accounts
we remove, new ones appear.

290
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,125
REINHARD

291
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,625
Where is Gremes?

292
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,667
Didn't he persuade Fred?

293
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,542
If he talks too much, what should we do?

294
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,500
Gremes, where on earth are you?

295
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,958
Gremes, was it your order?

296
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,042
No, what are you talking about?

297
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,042
I just gave Fred a push for
the sake of the kingdom.

298
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,583
I didn't expect it to be live broadcasted
for the whole world to see.

299
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,833
Really?

300
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:47,333
Sometimes I don't understand
what you're thinking, Gremes.

301
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,458
No matter how things develop,
we need to settle this.

302
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,958
The drone is filming, right?

303
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,167
Currently, there's no problem.

304
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:57,917
What about you?

305
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,167
I have prepared 7 700
disposable accounts.

306
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,417
It's useless no matter how you delete it.

307
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,833
Crossing Republic walls and trenches and
sleeping in the wilderness was worth it.

308
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,958
I hope you can also consider those
who are forced to accompany you.

309
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,333
Chief Fred obviously found the camera.

310
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,667
Honestly, I thought he would destroy it
with magic right away.

311
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,125
Since he lets us be,
that's pretty good, right?

312
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,750
Is that okay?

313
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,792
After all, the kingdom would undoubtedly
not want such footage to become public.

314
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,750
Surely it's because he doesn't want
to take care of the kingdom anymore.

315
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,167
Once, the hero and his group
fought to keep the Kingdom safe.

316
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:41,125
But now they are at odds because
of the kingdom's interests.

317
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,375
Fred probably can't take it anymore.

318
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,333
He intends to forego everything,
including his status and reputation,

319
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,792
in order to engage in a deadly battle
with his comrade Leo.

320
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,167
Isn't this…

321
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,083
the kind of thing that
everyone enjoys seeing?

322
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,625
I knew it.

323
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:05,667
Come on, let's continue filming.
We need to convey the truth.

324
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:06,875
Okay.

325
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,167
It hurts.

326
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,750
Here you are.

327
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,958
What's with your disgustingly long hair?

328
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,542
Who are you trying to seduce?

329
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,792
Don't you think about how old you are?

330
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,792
My subordinates seem to
have caused you trouble.

331
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,958
You're taking it too easy
with your feelings.

332
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,292
Don't you worry about their safety?

333
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:44,792
I am just worried that if they lie down
on the ground, mosquitos will bite them.

334
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:47,292
I've told them not to bother.

335
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,708
I apologize.

336
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,750
Then you should wait for me
near the city wall.

337
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,792
By the way, have you seen Max recently?

338
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,833
Have you seen him?

339
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,458
Yeah, it startled me.

340
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,167
Is that bastard serious?

341
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,583
I'm going to kill him.

342
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,458
I didn't recognize him at first
because he was wearing glasses.

343
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,875
But his skills have not regressed at all.

344
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,250
What about that thing flying in the sky?

345
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,625
If you don't want to be filmed,
then do it as you like.

346
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,583
Then I'll make it easier to film.

347
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,167
Is this okay?

348
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:39,583
No, since we have the chance,
let's be a little more considerate.

349
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,042
These two are outrageous.
Is the drone okay?

350
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,708
I guess so.

351
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,167
Is this for real?

352
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,792
It's not bad like this.

353
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,708
The view is quite good.

354
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,583
Goodbye, Fred.
