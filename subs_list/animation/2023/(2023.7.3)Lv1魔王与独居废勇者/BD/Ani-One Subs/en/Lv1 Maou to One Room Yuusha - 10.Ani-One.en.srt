1
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,208
What's going on? Damn it!

2
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,375
W-Who are you?

3
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,750
I came to meet the Hero and his party.

4
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,000
I didn't realize it was
just a trio of dorks.

5
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,500
Her magic is really powerful.

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,167
She might even surpass Fred.

7
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,708
Thank you for saving us.

8
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,625
I will be the one
to defeat the Demon Lord.

9
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,667
You guys might as well go home
and drink your mother's milk.

10
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:20,417
Why is it you again?

11
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,583
Thank you for saving us, Yuria.

12
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,583
Come a bit closer.

13
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,042
You're cold, aren't you?

14
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:12,125
Although those enemies are demons,
they are mostly just minions.

15
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,875
I was all geared up for nothing.

16
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,125
That's what I'm saying.

17
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,750
We will save you the next time, Yuria.

18
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,583
That guy's got a real attitude.

19
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,417
You're not in a position
to talk about her.

20
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,875
Didn't I tell you to go home?

21
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,458
And you dare say
all demons are just minions.

22
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,583
You guys didn't see it at all.

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,250
The opponents are getting tougher.

24
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,292
If I hadn't helped,

25
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,542
you would have been killed.

26
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,375
This is my last advice.

27
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,250
When the sun rises,
you guys should just go home.

28
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,208
Yuria,

29
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,375
you don't have to be so mean.

30
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,833
We are companions now, aren't we?

31
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,083
I don't need companions.

32
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,125
Why is she so angry?

33
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,667
Just ignore her.

34
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,583
I see.

35
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,333
It's a shame to keep you
in the human realm.

36
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,250
Would you like to be
reincarnated as a demon?

37
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,000
Spare me the joke.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,583
My goal is to defeat the Demon Lord.

39
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,958
And I'm the only one who can do it.

40
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,750
Because you refuse to obey,

41
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,333
I will make your corpse serve me.

42
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,792
Yuria!

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,625
You attacked a single woman,
how despicable.

44
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,333
This guy seems quite tough.

45
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,708
I need to give it my all.

46
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,667
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

47
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,833
(Episode10: Leo vs. Fred)

48
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,917
Do you think you can
beat me with brute force,

49
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,042
Fred?

50
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,500
He hit it.

51
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,625
Chief.

52
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,083
It brings back old memories.

53
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,125
Your healing spell has saved me

54
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,292
numerous times in the past.

55
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,167
But your way of fighting
is quite reckless.

56
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,958
Why did you choose to fight alone?

57
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,583
I thought you would
bring Max and the others.

58
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,750
Are they undead?

59
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,917
It seems like they're talking.
Can you hear them?

60
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:49,292
It would be nice
if they spoke a little louder.

61
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,458
You've always been discreet.

62
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:55,833
Fighting me alone is not something
you would do because it is reckless.

63
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,250
I thought you had other considerations.

64
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,625
But it seems you really did come alone.

65
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,292
Are you here to die, Fred?

66
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,125
You're overestimating yourself.

67
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,333
Your companions put you on
a pedestal, and you think you're a king.

68
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,083
Has this made
you forget your own strength?

69
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,417
I'm not a king.

70
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,792
I know very well I'm not cut out for that.

71
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,875
Nonsense.

72
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,417
You said I'm reckless,
and I return those words to you.

73
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,458
This stupid situation
was entirely your fault.

74
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,583
What? Republic Gamma?

75
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,083
Don't underestimate people!

76
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,458
Of course, I understand.
It's indeed stupid.

77
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,000
But…

78
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:49,500
When I was exiled to
this 'Millennium Wilderness,'

79
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,708
there were subordinates
willing to follow me,

80
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,458
companions who admired me,

81
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,792
and together we developed this land
that even the kingdom had abandoned.

82
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,542
We all dug up the magical ore
and the hot springs

83
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,625
with the determination to die.

84
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:08,542
The kingdom, however, offered no rewards
and attempted to take everything.

85
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,750
How should they live in the future,
and how should they feel about it?

86
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,583
Indeed.

87
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,625
This is utterly unreasonable.

88
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,917
But not getting rewards despite
hard work is a common occurrence.

89
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,958
You should have realized
your limits earlier.

90
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,625
Whether it's you
or those incompetent subordinates.

91
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,500
Do you think the kingdom will

92
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,000
recognize your independence
if you kill me?

93
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,000
The pointless war
you started will never end.

94
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,042
The war will definitely end.
I will end it with my own hands.

95
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:57,500
Our voices can surely reach
the citizens of the kingdom.

96
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,625
One day, they will be willing to listen.

97
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,667
Perhaps so.

98
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,458
You can keep fighting all you want.

99
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,375
Your demands will surely be conveyed.

100
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,208
I'm sure it'll end well someday.

101
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,083
Assuming that everyone
in the world is like you,

102
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:16,792
mentally and physically healthy,
upright and honest.

103
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,917
LIVE, THE KINGDOM ATTACKS THE REPUBLIC GAMMA
LIVE

104
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,250
As expected of Leo and Fred.

105
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,167
Their abilities have not deteriorated
in the ten years since.

106
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,500
The battle is fierce.

107
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,500
If this continues,
their bodies won't hold up.

108
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,083
Aren't you watching?

109
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,333
I'm not interested.

110
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,833
This isn't the time for you to be snide.

111
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,208
They're your companions.

112
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,083
This is basically mutual slaughter.

113
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,708
It's not something you
can ignore with a "not interested."

114
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,458
Are you just going to watch
your companions die?

115
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,917
Speak up, hero.

116
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,000
Shut up.

117
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,583
What else can I do?

118
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,542
What can I do if I go there?

119
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,958
Which side should I stand on?

120
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,083
Tell me.

121
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,708
This is about me killing

122
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,750
Leo or Fred, isn't it?

123
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,583
Are you trying to force me
to make a choice?

124
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:45,583
Is that so?

125
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,125
What a pity, Max.

126
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,792
In that case, do as you wish.

127
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,500
I will leave you be.

128
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,500
Farewell.

129
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,042
That's why I said you're too honest.

130
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,917
You bastard.

131
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,875
This guy is…

132
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,875
W-What?

133
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,208
What happened?

134
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,250
It hurts like hell.

135
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,583
The camera…

136
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,458
Found it.

137
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,708
Long time no see, foolish humans.

138
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:43,792
What?

139
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,208
How did she suddenly appear?

140
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,375
I originally came to see
your stupid faces in peace.

141
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,500
Then I ran into a boring human fight.

142
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,875
This is so pleasant.

143
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,000
Come on, humans.

144
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,250
Recall your past fears.

145
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,750
At this moment,

146
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,000
I officially announce the
full resurrection of the Demon Lord.

147
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,375
How cute.

148
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,125
That guy.

149
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,542
What is he doing?

150
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,250
What's up with that brat?

151
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,667
Did he mention something
about Demon Lord?

152
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,000
Who knows, quickly tell him
to get out of the way.

153
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,708
How can we tell him to
get out of the way from here?

154
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,625
Don't mess with the drone.

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,583
That demon is…

156
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,083
Do you know who he is?

157
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,792
He was the demon by
his side the day I saw Max.

158
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,000
What are you saying?

159
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:43,583
I know Max has been
hanging out with demons recently,

160
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,375
but this is the first time
I've seen that demon.

161
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,667
What the hell is he thinking?

162
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,917
Demon Lord?

163
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:52,417
First, to celebrate my resurrection,

164
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:56,125
I'm going to kill the hero's
companions in a bloody mess.

165
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,792
You, who are wounded all over,
are not my adversaries.

166
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,250
Sink into my darkness, Leo, Fred.

167
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,583
W-Wait. Seriously?

168
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,167
Take this!

169
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,125
It seems we have to interrupt.

170
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,167
Yeah.

171
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,708
How is that possible?

172
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,958
What do you think, Fred?

173
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,833
It seems familiar, is he really…

174
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,000
When the hero is not present,

175
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
you shamelessly begin infighting.

176
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,875
It's simply not worth fearing.

177
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,667
Hero Max, you see everything, don't you?

178
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,292
What are you doing?

179
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,750
If you don't come over,

180
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,458
you will truly lose everything this time.

181
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,250
If you don't want to
watch your friends die,

182
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,583
hurry up and come over.

183
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:12,417
Let's do it again, Max.

184
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,167
It seems like one more thing
I have to ask Max about.

185
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,333
Then let's finish this first.

186
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,375
In case someone else interferes.

187
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,583
Damn it.

188
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,833
Everyone is doing this to me.

189
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,583
I don't care anymore.

190
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,042
I really don't care anymore.

191
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,417
Whatever.

192
00:16:55,708 --> 00:17:00,833
Whatever works.

193
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,208
Testing.

194
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,792
I am not sure
if the audience is getting this.

195
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:14,167
Fred and Leo have been
fighting fiercely since just now.

196
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:19,750
The kingdom and republic's fate
depends on their fight.

197
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,542
Which side will triumph over

198
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,250
superb skills and magical counterattacks?

199
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,208
Someone commented that you're noisy.

200
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:45,583
Okay.

201
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,625
Let's go.

202
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,708
The chain came loose.

203
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,542
It's really not good.

204
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:14,917
It's a pain in the ass,
and it makes my hands dirty.

205
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,083
I might as well not go.

206
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,792
Oh man.

207
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,125
Geez.

208
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,208
What is that?

209
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,750
Look out!

210
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,667
The traffic is congested,
the road is narrow,

211
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,208
and they still insist that
"bicycles must ride in the lane."

212
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,875
The lane should then be

213
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,000
reorganized to allow bicycles to pass!

214
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,292
Well then, you should be prepared to die.

215
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,792
Yeah, but…

216
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:34,375
You're prepared too, right?

217
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,958
Chief, please.

218
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,542
Let's stop here.

219
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:49,875
What's wrong?

220
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:01,125
Don't block the way!

221
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,083
Die, Leo!

222
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,292
Bring it on, Fred!

223
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,458
What a surprise, I've run out of moves.

224
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,125
We've got him on the ropes.

225
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,833
Just give up.

226
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,542
You are so hurt,
and yet you want to fight me.

227
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,208
Even when death is near,
you keep talking big…

228
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:50,333
I'm looking forward to our next meeting.

229
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,000
Damn it, he escaped.

230
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,958
Are you okay, Yuria?

231
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,292
Thank goodness you're safe.

232
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,708
Why did you save me?

233
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:12,042
Because you're a
valuable force to be reckoned with.

234
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,125
We can't just watch you die for nothing.

235
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,250
Do you know what this is called?

236
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,583
It's called "companionship."

237
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Alright, let's go.
