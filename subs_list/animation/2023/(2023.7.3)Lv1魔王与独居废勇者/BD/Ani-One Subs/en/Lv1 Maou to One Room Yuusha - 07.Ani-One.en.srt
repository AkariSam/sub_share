1
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:06,667
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

2
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:33,625
(Episode 7: The Secretary is Struggling)
Zenia, we're back.

3
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,958
-Strange.
-What's up?

4
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,125
Zenia does not appear to be at home.

5
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,542
Normally, if I call her,
she will come right away.

6
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:46,458
Did she go shopping in that odd outfit?

7
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,708
I asked her to look into something
before we left on our journey.

8
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:55,875
Don't even think about
sneaking a bite of souvenirs!

9
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,667
First come, first serve.

10
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,500
I am also craving buns.

11
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:07,708
Zenia, we'll be out for about two days.

12
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,375
During this time, please take care
of things for us…

13
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:13,333
Look into the Magic Bureau,
where Fred works.

14
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,750
Understood, leave it to me.

15
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,750
So this is the Magic Bureau.

16
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,750
It is a vital national body
in charge of overseeing

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,667
the kingdom's magical energy industry

18
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,875
MAGIC BUREAU
the kingdom's magical energy industry

19
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,708
MAGIC BUREAU
and related military forces.

20
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:36,625
I can see why His Majesty wants to
look into the Magic Bureau.

21
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,458
I will complete the mission regardless.

22
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,125
It appears impossible to infiltrate
through the main entrance.

23
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,917
But don't dismiss me
as a simple secretary.

24
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,958
I will enter the Magic Bureau from
the back, where there are fewer windows.

25
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,167
Zenia's special seven spy tools,

26
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,458
grapple hook.

27
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,500
Go!

28
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:03,917
The grapple hook snags.

29
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,708
Sneak in from the roof
to avoid being seen.

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,333
This is the common sense way
of being a spy.

31
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,417
What's that?

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,125
Naturally, the roof's door is locked.

33
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,417
But now it is time to use

34
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,208
the second of the seven tools,
the lockpick.

35
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,000
I will use this

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,250
to pick the lock…

37
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,708
The invasion was a success.

38
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,292
Who are you?

39
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,000
Remove any witnesses as soon as possible.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,250
This is also a spy rule.

41
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,583
But His Majesty once said that

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,542
humans are not like us demons.

43
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,667
They are unable to reawaken from the dead.

44
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,167
Therefore, we must not kill humans
without cause. Do you get it?

45
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,125
Your Majesty is so cool.

46
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,000
You should thank His Majesty.

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,042
I won't take your life.

48
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,292
Hello.

49
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:13,458
May I ask who you--

50
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,958
It seems like I run into people here
more often than I thought.

51
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,917
I should enter through
the ventilation duct.

52
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:25,458
My only goal is to gather information.

53
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,208
Normally, the data room or server room

54
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:31,208
is where I can get information.

55
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,667
THIRD OF THE SEVEN TOOLS, ENERGY JELLY
I will mark these locations for investigation.

56
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,667
His Majesty will be overjoyed

57
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,292
if I can bring back
the Magic Bureau's data.

58
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,792
Cafeteria.

59
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,667
Toilet.

60
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,625
I found it. It's the server room.

61
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,875
It's so cold.

62
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,958
There's only one staff member here.

63
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,792
I need to deal with him first.

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,250
Fourth of the seven tools, Hypnosis Dart.

65
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,333
What's this?

66
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,667
Problem solved.

67
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,500
Alright, now let's get to the main point.

68
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,542
The fifth of the seven tools,

69
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,042
hacker tool.

70
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,292
There's a lot of data here.
This might take a while.

71
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,792
Should I just call it quits?

72
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,958
There is also a lot of documentation.

73
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,208
Travel expenses should be
borne by oneself.

74
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,542
Charge your phone at home.

75
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,292
The Magic Bureau is extremely frugal.

76
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,167
This is the documentation for today.

77
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:45,458
Botega and the Kingdom's army attacked
Republic Gamma and retreated.

78
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,875
It is indeed difficult to suppress
the enemy with our current strength.

79
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,167
The key is…

80
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,083
So you were the reason.

81
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,667
No wonder I'm getting a headache similar
to when I'm approaching low air pressure.

82
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,667
Demon clan, what brings you here?

83
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,792
Sixth of the seven tools,

84
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:07,792
smoke bomb.

85
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,042
Bang!

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,292
You have the audacity to do
such a stupid thing.

87
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,333
But this is an unexpected gain.

88
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,750
My deepest apologies, Chief Fred.

89
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,250
We actually let this suspicious person
infiltrate the Magic Bureau.

90
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,167
Let's contact the police first.

91
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,375
No, no need.

92
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,833
You go out first, don't let anyone in.

93
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,083
Okay, just relax and answer my questions.

94
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,042
First, give me your name.

95
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,708
I am a noble demon.

96
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,500
How can I tell a human my name?

97
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,000
So you are a demon clan.

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,292
Thank you for confirming that for me.

99
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,000
T-This is bad.

100
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,333
I miss the good old days.

101
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,875
On the battlefield ten years ago,
I saw a variety of demon clans.

102
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,625
I have never seen
a demon clan as adorable as you.

103
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,375
W-What is this?

104
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,167
I won't fall for this trick.

105
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,792
Pardon me, I couldn't help
but speak a few words.

106
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,542
What do you do and where do you live?

107
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,000
Have you had enough?
Are you looking down on me?

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,583
If you want to kill me, just do it.

109
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,708
I would rather die

110
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,917
than give up my demon dignity

111
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,333
and submit to humans.

112
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,000
I see. Your name is Zenia.

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,542
Damn, you tricked me into saying that.

114
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:51,333
By the way, I'm Fred,
the Magic Bureau Chief.

115
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,542
I should have introduced myself first.

116
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,917
Sorry, I was rude again.

117
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,667
Of course I know about this.

118
00:07:56,667 --> 00:08:00,917
Because you heroes are His Majesty's
and our demons' enemies.

119
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,250
You are our most hated enemies.

120
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,542
Isn't Your Majesty the Demon Lord?

121
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:09,000
Although we are enemies,
I can't help but admire him.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,917
You're here on the Demon Lord's
orders, aren't you?

123
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,958
N-No.

124
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,208
His Majesty has been asleep
since you defeated him.

125
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,667
I just came here out of curiosity.

126
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,833
Speaking of which, Zenia,

127
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,375
I believe I have seen you somewhere.

128
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,667
What now? I won't say a word.

129
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,625
Where have I seen you before?

130
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,875
That's right, I saw you here.

131
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,667
Look.

132
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,042
Is this you?

133
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:48,583
What's with the photo? Did you take it
sneakily? You're being indecent.

134
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:52,000
This was on a trashy news site
a while back.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,708
You are quite daring to
run naked down the street.

136
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,542
Not that, I was a little drunk
at the time.

137
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:02,708
I understand. When people are drunk,
they can lose control.

138
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,792
I'm sure you had a great time, and I wish
I could have been there to see it.

139
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,500
HERO MAX AND A NAKED WOMAN PLAY TAG LATE AT NIGHT
So you drank with this guy who was running?

140
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,458
Uh…yes.

141
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,250
You met a jerk.

142
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,458
He got you drunk

143
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,750
and then ran away like a coward.

144
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,625
I have no idea who this guy is,

145
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,750
but he seems like a complete coward.

146
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,458
Zenia, you must not be taken in
by such a bad man.

147
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,917
Who is this man?

148
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:36,167
Um…I can't remember
because I was so drunk.

149
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,875
So you only met this man once?

150
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,333
Yes…

151
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,875
But there's nothing between us.

152
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,792
I see…

153
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,208
I am relieved to hear you say that.

154
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,458
If you had a relationship with that poor,
jobless old man, it will be difficult.

155
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,833
How is that even possible? A guy like him…

156
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,250
Stop playing dumb.

157
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,417
You really think I'm clueless?

158
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,167
Answer me.

159
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:14,042
Why are you trying to get close to Max?

160
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,750
What kind of evil thoughts are
you trying to instill in Max,

161
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,250
you dirty demon clan?

162
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,167
Answer me!

163
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,917
Sorry to interrupt.

164
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:34,167
Minister Gremes has arrived, Chief Fred.

165
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,667
Let him wait.

166
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,083
But…

167
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,375
He said he has pressing issues.

168
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,042
If you don't hurry over…

169
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:47,750
This handcuff has the ability to greatly
suppress the wearer's magical power.

170
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,125
It means you can't do the magic
you're best at.

171
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,208
Don't even consider fleeing.

172
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,708
Chief.

173
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,500
By any means, don't notify the police.

174
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Keep an eye on her until I return, Lim.

175
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,000
Chief Fred,

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,792
sorry for interrupting your busy schedule.

177
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:15,875
No problem.

178
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,583
The minister appears
to be very busy as well.

179
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,417
Would you like to go on a date with me?

180
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,375
I know a good place.

181
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,333
N-No need, I'm really terrified.

182
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,083
Chief Fred is here, minister.

183
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,625
Fred.

184
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,208
It's been a long time since we last met.

185
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,458
Minister Gremes, I am honored that
you have come to personally visit me.

186
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:45,167
You've learned how to flatter.

187
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,625
I am over the moon.

188
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,625
What is the chief thinking?

189
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:58,042
He unusually handcuffs and interrogates
the criminal without notifying the police.

190
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,833
Isn't this the same as being imprisoned?

191
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,792
I was too careless.

192
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:06,292
I not only got caught,
but I also leaked information by accident.

193
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,458
At the very least, I can't let them know
that His Majesty has been resurrected.

194
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,500
His Majesty was only recently resurrected.

195
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,917
If the two sides go to war, His Majesty
will undoubtedly be at a disadvantage.

196
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,833
Anyway, I need to figure out
how to get out of here first.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,458
Ex-Excuse me.

198
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,792
What's wrong with you?

199
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,792
I-I want to go to the bathroom.

200
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,875
Sorry, I came to find you out of the blue.

201
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,958
How have you been recently?

202
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,250
Minister, please get to the point.

203
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,333
After all, the chief took time out of
his busy schedule to see you.

204
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,750
Let's take a commemorative photo first.

205
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,083
Smile, Fred.

206
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,083
Minister. Geez.

207
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
TODAY I VISITED THE MAGIC BUREAU. A SELFIE WITH THE CHIEF
Done.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,375
TODAY I VISITED THE MAGIC BUREAU. A SELFIE WITH THE CHIEF
Your smile is great. You are indeed the chief.

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,833
How about it? This is an app that
can change expressions.

210
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,375
I'm very sorry, Chief.

211
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,167
Don't immediately share the photo
you took on social media.

212
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,958
Weren't we chastised the last time
our itinerary was revealed?

213
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,750
It's too late, I've already posted.

214
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,667
Your face looks pale.

215
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,333
Are you worried about Leo?

216
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,042
Worried?

217
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:26,458
It is a matter of prestige and interest
for the kingdom, which worries me.

218
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,542
This country was fantastic ten years ago.

219
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,417
Although we were much poorer
than we are now.

220
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,042
You heroes defeated the Demon Lord.

221
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,625
This country was full of
vitality everywhere.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,958
How is Max doing?

223
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,625
Are you still in touch with him, Fred?

224
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,583
No, he's hopeless.

225
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,000
That's really lonely.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,750
Minister, I'll have dinner
with you another day.

227
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,042
Right, right. Sorry, sorry.

228
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,250
I need to get to the point quickly.
Don't be angry.

229
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,333
Geez.

230
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,625
You should have learned your lesson
and stopped engaging in illegal invasion.

231
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,917
It's so embarrassing.

232
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,125
Are you okay? Sit down slowly.

233
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,250
My clothes.

234
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,583
Let me help you take it off.

235
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,583
The clothes you wear
are really hard to take off.

236
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you done? Then let me help you wipe.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,750
Please press the warm water button
for washing. The weakest.

238
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,792
You are one stubborn female spy.

239
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,750
Thank you very much.

240
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,208
It would be bad if Fred came back.

241
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,375
If he interrogates me again,
I may say something about His Majesty.

242
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,375
I have to escape before that.

243
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,042
Here you go. Please eat.

244
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,917
What do you want to eat next?

245
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,667
I want asparagus. Please wrap it in bacon.

246
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,458
You're really a handful.

247
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:54,375
If I want to escape,
I have to get past her.

248
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,125
I really don't want to do this.

249
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:01,958
First of all, thank you for
letting Botega join.

250
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,208
Regardless of the outcome… As you know.

251
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,833
Lucky for him, his injuries
were not too bad.

252
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,667
So,

253
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,167
why are we stuck in this situation?

254
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,458
Leo bears sole responsibility.

255
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,208
If he doesn't take matters
into his own hands…

256
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,417
But the Gamma region is barren.

257
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,833
If the kingdom had welcomed Leo
and his team with open arms

258
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,833
when they discovered
a large vein of magical ore…

259
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:32,083
If we had done that, the kingdom's
reputation would have suffered.

260
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:37,042
He became enraged and even betrayed
the kingdom after denying taking bribes.

261
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:40,292
How could the kingdom
forgive and accept such a person?

262
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,167
Fred,

263
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,958
do you believe Leo is someone
who would accept bribes?

264
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:50,417
His brain capacity is limited.

265
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,083
I agree.

266
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,792
Leo was framed. Poor guy.

267
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,083
Nonetheless,

268
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,750
his rebellion was rash and irrational.

269
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,125
Yes.

270
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:07,042
He must not have expected
the kingdom he trusted to doubt him.

271
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,333
He can't stand it anymore.

272
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,083
He is a noble and incorruptible man.

273
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,417
In our eyes, he is overly bright.

274
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,583
How should I put it?

275
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,708
Noble and incorruptible people

276
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,500
usually expect the same
from those around them.

277
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,375
The Republic Gamma will
never develop smoothly.

278
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:31,208
Fred, you probably won't agree.

279
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,292
To be honest,

280
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:38,083
I would like to propose a peace treaty
to the Republic Gamma.

281
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,958
Many people in the kingdom understand
Leo and the republic.

282
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,708
I believe that a peaceful approach
will gain some traction.

283
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,000
More importantly, aside from self-defense,

284
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,625
the Republic Gamma hasn't
directly harmed the kingdom.

285
00:16:55,625 --> 00:17:00,542
However, public opinion toward
the kingdom is deteriorating.

286
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:04,500
The kingdom's recognition of it
as a nation is another matter.

287
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,708
I only hope that both parties
can take a step back.

288
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,333
I hope we can end this peacefully
without any disputes.

289
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,750
What do you think?

290
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,042
Are you serious?

291
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,083
What do the other ministers say?

292
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,708
The old lady said it's fine.

293
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,792
After all, she has always spoiled Leo.

294
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,958
The others…

295
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,000
I can only persuade them slowly.

296
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,375
One step at a time.

297
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:32,500
The first priority is to temporarily
halt military operations along the border.

298
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,333
I hope to have a free, peaceful,
and helpful relationship in the future.

299
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:42,000
To achieve this, we need your help.

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,125
Because you are Leo's companion

301
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,375
and have a lot of support in the kingdom.

302
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,792
I will just have to do it.

303
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:59,333
Anyway, I need to remove these
magic-suppressing handcuffs first.

304
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,042
Fred made a mistake.

305
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:04,583
I can't use magic in the first place.

306
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,292
So I have already devised
a solution to this problem.

307
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:10,083
The seventh of the seven tools
I hide in my clothes,

308
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,833
slippery lubricant.

309
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,333
ZENIA'S NEW MEDICINE
Good, now I can…

310
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,333
Pull it out smoothly.

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Huh?

312
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,042
What are you doing?

313
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,667
I am thirsty, so I thought
I would have a sports drink.

314
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,958
There's no such thing as
a sticky sports drink.

315
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,792
Listen.

316
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,917
I'm a direct subordinate of Chief Fred.

317
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,708
I have some understanding of magic.

318
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,708
If you dare to scheme,
I won't hesitate to use force.

319
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,250
I just don't want to do it.

320
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,167
I won't take you to the bathroom either.

321
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,042
Are you listening?

322
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:56,208
You can't break free like that.

323
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,417
Just behave.

324
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,875
Okay, I broke free.

325
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,458
Ouch.

326
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,000
I forgot my feet were covered in them.

327
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,958
It looks like you are not
a typical Cosplay dork.

328
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:32,000
I finally get what the chief is thinking.

329
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,333
You are a level A dangerous individual.

330
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,125
I am not going to let you go.

331
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,333
Would you like to board my ship?

332
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,542
Fred.

333
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,375
Alright.

334
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,708
After all, Minister Gremes
personally invited me.

335
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,917
I will do my best.

336
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,875
You arrogant prince.

337
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,375
-Gremes pats on the head.
-Ouch. I'm not a prince…

338
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,667
Great, then I can rest assured.

339
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,625
I'll talk to you in detail another day.

340
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,167
I am sorry to disturb you at work.

341
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,583
Yeah, please hurry back.

342
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,750
Chief, we really appreciate
your time today.

343
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,875
Goodbye.

344
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,667
Are you going back, Minister Gremes?

345
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,833
You've worked hard, Minister Gremes.

346
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,208
See you next time.

347
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:28,958
Thanks.

348
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,917
You certainly made a stir.

349
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:42,125
Are you satisfied, Miss Spy?

350
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,292
Don't worry.

351
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:50,708
I can control my flames' smoke,
temperature, and burning range.

352
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,083
I won't take your life.

353
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,083
I can't… breathe…

354
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,792
I must put you to sleep
for a little while.

355
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,417
My consciousness…

356
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,042
That's great, Minister.

357
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,583
But the main show is just getting started.

358
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:11,750
What the minister said
almost made me pass out.

359
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,917
Our next schedule is…

360
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,417
Does anyone like it?

361
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,958
First is the meeting attended by
Deputy Minister Melbin.

362
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,625
Then the plum viewing party…

363
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:44,000
Something has happened, Minister!
The Magic Bureau…

364
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,750
exploded!

365
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,667
No way.

366
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,583
It's dangerous, you can't stop.

367
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,375
Drive away quickly,
I don't want to get involved.

368
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,542
It is a terrorist attack.
Terrorist attack.

369
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,375
The Republic has finally taken action.

370
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,500
Now you're really in a tight spot.

371
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,750
What would you do?

372
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,667
Monk Fred.
