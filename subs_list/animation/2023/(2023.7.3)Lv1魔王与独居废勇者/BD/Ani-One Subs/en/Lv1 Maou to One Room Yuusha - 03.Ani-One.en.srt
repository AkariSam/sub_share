1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,833
The weather is likely to change.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,042
Let's find a place to rest.

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,208
What are they doing? I am demotivated…

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,083
It's a barrier. A powerful barrier
has been set up here.

5
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,917
This talisman

6
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:40,917
will protect you from
the demons' interference.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,958
As you can see, the demon clan
hasn't damaged this town.

8
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:49,667
A new demon type has appeared recently.

9
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,667
There's no room for complacency now.

10
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,333
That's why

11
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,292
we've made a new talisman this time.

12
00:00:57,292 --> 00:01:00,958
This is the most powerful product
that our monks have ever created.

13
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:04,958
We are discounting today only.

14
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,875
-I'll take one…
-I want it too…

15
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,542
Okay, everyone, don't rush.

16
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,042
If you don't line up,
you will not get divine protection.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,375
What's all the fuss over there?

18
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,708
-Limited supply today. One person can only purchase up to two.
-A talisman for repelling demons, huh?

19
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,417
-For more, fill out this pre-order form.
-Rare opportunity. Should we buy one?

20
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,625
Are you two interested in buying one?

21
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:30,667
This is a powerful talisman that
can protect you from demons.

22
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,375
Are you sure it works?

23
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,875
Of course, it works.

24
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,792
No matter how strong a demon is,

25
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,083
if you hold the talisman up like this,
something amazing will happen.

26
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,458
The demons will be intimidated
and turn away.

27
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,750
It sounds like a scam.

28
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,208
If you're not buying, please leave.

29
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:55,250
You two scruffy travelers
are unworthy of this holy place…

30
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,833
You, run!

31
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,042
Yes!

32
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,708
It looks like neither of you are
a typical strong man.

33
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,958
You don't seem like
an ordinary monk either.

34
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,917
Let's charge!

35
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:18,792
(Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero)

36
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,000
(Episode 3: The Monk Fred)
Mr. Max, please look at this.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,792
(Episode 3: The Monk Fred)
What is this?

38
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,833
(Episode 3: The Monk Fred)
Anyhow, I need your advice.

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,833
Wait… Max,

40
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,375
this is not for you…

41
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,917
WARRIOR LEO'S REBELLION FROM THE KINGDOM
This is not for you…

42
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,750
Nonsense.

43
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,750
Max…

44
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,125
What happened to Mr. Max?

45
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,000
Considering his feelings,
it can't be helped.

46
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,417
WARRIOR LEO
His former comrade betrayed the kingdom.

47
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,500
It must not be a happy thing.

48
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,375
Let's go to a video appreciation store.

49
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,208
Excuse me,

50
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:39,417
we are from FREEDAY Weekly.
You are Mr. Max, right?

51
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,167
Have you seen this video?

52
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,667
HERO, NAKED FEMALE
You are the one being chased, right?

53
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,458
Yes.

54
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,000
Who is this lady?

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,208
She's my friend.

56
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,083
Really? Are you just ordinary friends?

57
00:05:55,083 --> 00:06:00,292
Yes, because…we drank together,
and she accidentally got drunk.

58
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:03,000
She's not underage, is she?

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, she's definitely not… I checked.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,750
Have you two had a physical relationship?

61
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,500
No, I can't say more.

62
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,750
That would be embarrassing for her.

63
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,292
Although I didn't do anything with her.

64
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,208
Then what is this lady's background?

65
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,083
What do you mean by that?

66
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,667
For example, her profession.

67
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,583
Uh… I think she told me that
she works in an office.

68
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,750
Sorry to startle you all,
but I have to go.

69
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,625
Wait, Mr. Max.

70
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,708
Can you comment on the
Republic Gamma's illegal occupation

71
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,875
of the northern part of the Kingdom,
led by Warrior Leo?

72
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,583
Let's go after him.

73
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,667
We must first confirm the exact address.

74
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:06,458
And clearly capture the moment
when that woman leaves his house.

75
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,667
Understood.

76
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,250
Where is he?

77
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,417
He must have turned this corner.

78
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,500
Why did he disappear?

79
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,042
We were completely shaken off.

80
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,667
Damn it.

81
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,708
Damn it.

82
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,083
My foot is soaked, how embarrassing.

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,917
I didn't expect what happened
that night to be caught on camera.

84
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:36,708
But it seems they didn't find out
Zenia is a demon.

85
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,667
Even going outside fills me with fear.

86
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,042
PASSERBY
It looks like that's where he lives.

87
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,208
It's so poignant.

88
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,417
A man who was once hailed as a hero

89
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:59,375
now can only live in
such a shabby apartment.

90
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's go.

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,042
Yes.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,042
Wet pants? What is wrong with you?
You're not a child.

93
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,542
None of your business.

94
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,083
I had no choice.

95
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,917
Alright, hurry up and get changed.

96
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,375
Did your underwear get wet too?

97
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,458
No, it didn't.

98
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,125
Stop it, don't take off my clothes.

99
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,750
But it must be uncomfortable
wearing wet underwear, right?

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,667
Take it off quickly.
I'll help you wash it.

101
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:26,250
Alright, alright, I'll take it off.
You turn over.

102
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,750
What are you talking about now?

103
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,625
Haven't you been wearing only one pair of
underwear since the day we met again?

104
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,250
Anyway, you're not allowed to look.

105
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,542
We have a visitor.

106
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,000
Alright, hurry up and change,
and then open the door.

107
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,875
You should go hide.

108
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,167
Hero, but…

109
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,750
Our visitor is not an ordinary person,
judging by the aura of magical power.

110
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,917
Don't worry about it.

111
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,458
If you're present,
things will only get more complicated.

112
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,750
Go hide quickly.

113
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,917
Alright.

114
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,375
Coming. I'll open the door right away.

115
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:11,875
You've appeared.

116
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,833
Fr-Fred.

117
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,833
Hi, long time no see.

118
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,667
I'm so glad to see you, Max.

119
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,833
What are your intentions?

120
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,667
What do you want?

121
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,125
What do you mean by what do I want?
You're so mean.

122
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,292
Aren't we good companions?

123
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,625
I just suddenly wanted to
see you and catch up.

124
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,208
You bring your subordinates to catch up?

125
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,333
I just happened to be passing by
on my way to work.

126
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,375
Anyway, I'm sorry for the intrusion,
let's go inside and talk.

127
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,750
Don't worry, I told my subordinates
to wait outside.

128
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,583
You are free to have a good time first.

129
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,875
Yes.

130
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,333
Is that alright now?

131
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,458
It's not bad once in a while.

132
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,958
I just wanted us to have a chat.

133
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,292
Who asked you to come without telling me?

134
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:10,000
I did not have time to get ready to
entertain you, Magic Bureau Chief.

135
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,375
I am not a cheif when I am with a friend.

136
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,917
Your place is pretty clean.

137
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:23,042
I remember your previous home
was much messier.

138
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,042
The Holy Sword Blaze Bringer.

139
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,917
Don't just throw it in the corner.

140
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:33,167
I don't need it anyway.

141
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,792
That is right, weapons like this
should never be used.

142
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,333
Do you want to put it in that cupboard?

143
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,500
The sword is too big to fit in there.

144
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,458
I see.

145
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,417
It's time to get to the point.
What are you really here for?

146
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,792
And how did you know I live here now?

147
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,583
It's so nostalgic.

148
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:03,125
It reminds me of the battle between us
and the demon clan ten years ago.

149
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,333
Can you answer my question?

150
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,542
Alright, listen to me.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Once we had to pass through
their defense net.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,917
At that time, we escaped
with my Invisible Barrier.

153
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,542
You remember, right?

154
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:20,958
That spell concealed
the barrier's interior.

155
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,708
I got it.

156
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,958
Let's stop talking about the past.

157
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,875
I want to talk about the Republic Gamma.

158
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,500
Republic Gamma.

159
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,875
The new nation founded three years ago

160
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,208
by the rebel warrior Leo.

161
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,542
WARRIOR LEO'S REBELLION FROM THE KINGDOM
DOCUMENTATION BY ZENIA

162
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:57,083
They pretended to be a republic,

163
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,083
but were actually a "terrorist group"
illegally occupying Kingdom territory.

164
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,375
That place is full of traitors and
sociopaths who follow that idiot.

165
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,958
And their military power
has increased significantly.

166
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,250
If this continues, the kingdom's peace
will undoubtedly be jeopardized.

167
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,417
Furthermore, Max, you are well aware of
Leo's bravery and skill in battle.

168
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,958
Do you intend to start a war?

169
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,083
Is he here to incite a fight between
his former comrades?

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,833
I'm not saying we will
start a war right away…

171
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,375
But conflict is inevitable
sooner or later.

172
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,375
We can't just sit and wait.

173
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,333
Yeah, if you're going to fight, good luck.

174
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,083
You should know…

175
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,750
What I'm trying to say, right?

176
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,833
Join us in the fight.

177
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,083
We can definitely stop Leo
with your present.

178
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,667
Please.

179
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,292
If you join the kingdom's army,

180
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,375
the war with the republic
will be over in no time.

181
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:08,458
Perhaps Leo will surrender
before the war breaks out.

182
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,417
In case the war turns into
a prolonged battle,

183
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,458
the casualties on both sides
will only increase.

184
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,875
I don't want to increase the death toll,

185
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,875
whether it's the kingdom's people
or the republic's people…

186
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,125
Please, lend us your strength.

187
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,292
I've already retired.

188
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:29,792
My combat abilities pale in comparison
to those of you in active service.

189
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,333
Lately, I often suffer from back pain.

190
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,417
I can't fight Leo.

191
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,792
Just let me off the hook.

192
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:38,417
It's precisely because you retired.

193
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,667
If you help the kingdom's army,
you can get a higher status.

194
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,708
This is a rare great opportunity for you.

195
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,750
You don't have much savings left, right?

196
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,792
Why are you, a person with so much power,
tying yourself up here?

197
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,208
You flatter me too much, Fred.

198
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,042
This is the limit of who I am.

199
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,125
I'm different from
those of you who stand out.

200
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,292
I'm sorry, but I don't plan to help you.

201
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,875
You should find someone more capable.

202
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:16,833
Does drawing a sword against your former
companion violate your righteousness?

203
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,458
Do I look like such a noble person?

204
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,042
I just don't like getting into trouble.

205
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:26,750
For the kingdom, for the republic,
for everyone.

206
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,333
It's utter nonsense.

207
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,083
I've had enough, just go back.

208
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,458
Is that so?

209
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,125
Max, it's truly a pity.

210
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,125
That's it then.

211
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,292
At least walk me to the door, Max.

212
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,625
Geez. He's finally leaving.

213
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,583
I was sweating bullets.

214
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,375
Speaking of which,

215
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,833
you've been pretty energetic lately.

216
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,333
What are you talking about?

217
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,458
Don't play dumb with me, I saw that video.

218
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,375
Weren't you playing hide and seek
with a naked girl?

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,375
How can this be?

220
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,833
If you want to play naked, keep in mind
that you should only do so at home.

221
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,667
Thanks for the advice.

222
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,750
From where did you meet that hot woman?

223
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,375
It does not matter.

224
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,292
No, this is a serious matter.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,250
Why are you so close to a demon woman?

226
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,917
Ordinary people may not notice it,
but you can't fool my eyes.

227
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,833
Am I right?

228
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,167
After all, we killed countless
demons ten years ago.

229
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,875
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't mind if you have
any ties to the demon clan.

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,833
If we can coexist, that's even better.

232
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,958
But what will the public think?

233
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,542
Most likely, it will be a much bigger
scandal than what has been said so far.

234
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,333
FREEDAY WEEKLY SPECIAL ISSUE
"Hero and the demon have an affair"

235
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,000
"Betraying humankind"

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,125
If it spreads,

237
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,917
you might end up being
labeled a traitor like Leo.

238
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:06,083
You mean that woman is a demon?

239
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,417
Then you've been mistaken.

240
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,042
Don't worry.

241
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,750
Only I'm aware of this.

242
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,833
Even my subordinates are unaware.

243
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,333
At least for now.

244
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,917
Think carefully about it.

245
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,708
Do you want to return as a hero,

246
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,208
or be a major criminal?

247
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,125
Do you have any evidence that

248
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,125
I privately conspired with the demons?

249
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,958
Don't just talk based on your intuition.

250
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,625
Max,

251
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,000
don't underestimate me.

252
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,042
I could tell that

253
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:42,875
this room has a "demonic" aura to it.

254
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:43,750
Moreover…

255
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,208
It is the demon that is
even more terrifying

256
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,458
than what I saw in the video…

257
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,292
Then I'm going to open it.

258
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,250
Fine.

259
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,750
Go ahead if you want to.

260
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,250
Fred, what's wrong?

261
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,500
Max, you…

262
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,375
Has anything strange happened
while living in this room?

263
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,792
Strange things?

264
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,625
What strange things?

265
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,125
How could nothing have happened?

266
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,292
Like this…

267
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,583
Why are you suddenly screaming?

268
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,583
Your face is extremely pale, are you okay?

269
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,375
I-I got to go.

270
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,375
Sorry.

271
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,083
Alright…

272
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,458
You don't have to see me off,
don't come closer.

273
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,292
What's wrong with you? You seem off.

274
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,250
It's you who's off, isn't it?

275
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,375
Goodbye.

276
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,917
No way, it's really too scary.

277
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,750
What's with that guy?

278
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,833
Anyway, am I saved… for now?

279
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,917
He's gone, that was a close call.

280
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,125
Did you do something to Fred?

281
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,292
I didn't do anything.

282
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,625
I just hid deep in the quilt.

283
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,208
It was my perfect hiding technique
that prevented a disaster.

284
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,000
Is that so?

285
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,875
Never mind.

286
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm exhausted.

287
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,625
Max, your companions…

288
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,958
Don't say it.

289
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,375
We have our own lives to live.

290
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,708
It's not like I can change
anything by interfering.

291
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,292
I see.

292
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,417
Maybe that's true.

293
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,208
Also… I'm sorry.

294
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,833
It's all because of me that
your position was almost threatened.

295
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,500
That's right, you're really good
at causing me trouble.

296
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,542
He left obediently today.

297
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:58,042
But someday, I'm afraid
I won't be able to stay in the kingdom.

298
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,000
When that time comes, come to my city.

299
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,083
That would be a complete
betrayal of humanity.

300
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,208
Chief Fred,

301
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,375
what's wrong? Are you okay?

302
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,750
I'm fine.

303
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,708
Were you attacked by the hero…?

304
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,625
No, it's not that.

305
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,958
Anyway, let's go. I want to go home.
I'm done working.

306
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,375
You can't.

307
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,167
There's a magic furnace
construction meeting later.

308
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,625
Damn it.

309
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,333
Max, I won't give up.

310
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,708
I'll definitely persuade you to join.

311
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,875
It's for your own good.

312
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,083
But I don't want to go to his house again.

313
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,458
Chief, can you walk on your own?

314
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,208
Is it all taken care of?

315
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:02,750
Be careful.

316
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,375
You're really quite skilled.

317
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,083
My name is Leo, nice to meet you.

318
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,708
Anyway, I'm just a fraudulent monk.

319
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,833
Selling this inferior product
for a high price.

320
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,625
Making money off of believers.

321
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,000
However, the lies have been revealed.

322
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,083
I can't stay in this town anymore.

323
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,875
But you were also protecting this place
in your own way, weren't you?

324
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,042
You managed to set up a barrier
around the entire town.

325
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,500
You're really something.

326
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,167
Did you do that too?

327
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,708
No way, you're super strong!

328
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,667
Do you want to join us?

329
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,167
I'm Max.

330
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,375
And you?

331
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,167
My name is Fred.

332
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,542
Your eyes show no deception, Fred.
