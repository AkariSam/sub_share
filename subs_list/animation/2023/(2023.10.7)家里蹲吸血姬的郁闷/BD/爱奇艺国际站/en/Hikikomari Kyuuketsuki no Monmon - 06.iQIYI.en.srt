1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,580
Now then

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,000
excluding first unit commander,

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,090
Petroz Kalamaria, who is out on
expedition, we are all here.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,220
Starting now,

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,890
I call to order this
council meeting of The Seven!

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,060
We have but one topic of discussion today.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,100
Which is,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,350
whether or not Terakomari Gandesblood

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,810
is worthy of being a Crimson Commander.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,320
Ever since she became one of The Seven,
she is undefeated in battle.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,990
Even in the recent Laperico War
she achieved 10 victories in a row.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,870
Terakomari Gandesblood's success
is a sight to behold.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,540
Whether it's abroad or at home,

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,080
on paper she has a convincing track record
receiving high praise.

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,380
But again,

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,630
it is all simply on paper!

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,340
Have any of you here actually
seen her fighting in battle?

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,050
No, I think not.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,390
Indeed, I have not heard of her fighting.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,100
The Seven stand as
a symbol of martial power.

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,099
It is our calling to destroy

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,150
our enemies with pure strength and muscle!

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,440
Do you understand that, Lord Gandesblood?

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,900
-Of c-course I understa--
-Yes, she understands!

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,490
It is you Lord Metal
who doesn't understand!

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,570
The truly strong do not fight the weak!

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,330
Lord Gandesblood understands
that better than anyone!

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,539
Hmph.

29
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:26,250
Let's get back on track.

30
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,710
As mentioned before,

31
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:32,250
Terakomari Gandesblood is
suspected of faking her abilities.

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,340
Ms. Gandesblood

33
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,300
do you have anything to say?

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,890
Y-Yes, I am the world's strongest.

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,850
That's not a counterargument.

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,479
I have solid evidence showing
she is not worthy of her title.

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,400
This is her student report card
from the Imperial Academy.

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,610
As you can see,

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,820
in both magic class and P.E.
she received the lowest score of 1.

40
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,700
Where did you get that?

41
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,410
It was easy to find using
the power of the Mascarella family.

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Either way you were
a hopeless underachiever.

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,000
You even dropped out of school, right?

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,840
Where were you
and what did you do for those 3 years?

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,180
Were you a shut-in?

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,510
All of that doesn't matter.

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,890
You abused your connections didn't you?

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,560
The noble Gandesbloods are
a Great House after all.

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,310
It wouldn't be hard for them to
have a daughter with

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
or record appointed as
a member of The Seven.

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,860
You just wanted to be popular, didn't you?

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,150
You wanted to be pampered, right?

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,570
After all you are making and selling
those hideous fan souvenirs.

54
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,160
You're not even
embarrassed about it, are you?

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,870
You're as brazen as a fox!

56
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,579
I wonder if all of that is really true?

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,870
L-Lady Karen...

58
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,090
Aside from the report card,

59
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,880
you've said Komari used
her connections to

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,420
become one of The Seven
and gain popularity.

61
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,590
Do you have any concrete evidence?

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,800
W-Well, that's...

63
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,050
You can't read people's minds right?

64
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,060
If you want to call a meeting of The Seven

65
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,890
and hold a trial, you have to

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,230
conduct a more thorough investigation.

67
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,810
There is certainly truth
to what Lady Karen says.

68
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,070
But it is beyond certain
that Terakomari Gandesblood

69
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,700
has not shown the ability
worthy of being one of The Seven!

70
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,320
In the first place,

71
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,829
it was I who made the final decision
to make Komari one The Seven.

72
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,829
-So what you are saying is
-Empress!

73
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,460
That's enough.

74
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,000
Bleat on as much as you like,
Frête Mascarella!

75
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,880
The cries of a runt
will never reach the ears of the strong.

76
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,890
Wa ha, I said it, I said it!

77
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,270
Ms. Gandesblood,

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,320
you must be kidding.

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,700
If you are that bold,

80
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,490
let us cross swords right here, right now!

81
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,580
Then it will all be laid bare!

82
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,790
We'll see if you are
really worth of The Seven!

83
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,000
I-I'd like nothing more!

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,040
Bring it on, Frête Mascarella!

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,960
With my incredible magic,
I'll transform you

86
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,670
into powder and create
a delicious omelet rice lunch with you!

87
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,050
...is what I would normally say.

88
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,180
But first I need to test

89
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,050
if you are even worthy of fighting me.

90
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,390
So my maid Villhaze will be your opponent!

91
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,520
It's up to you, Vill.

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,430
No.

93
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,690
It seems she isn't available.

94
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,020
Then we shall cross
swords at another time.

95
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,030
You are a mockery!

96
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,870
Now, we shall move on
to a majority vote by The Seven

97
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,409
deciding the fate of
Terakomari Gandesblood.

98
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,210
In light of the exchange we just had

99
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,920
no one would be foolish
enough to still think that

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,670
she is worth of being a Crimson Commander?

101
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,220
I am, right here!

102
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,300
Thank you Sakuna!

103
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,140
Your kindness touches my heart.

104
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,770
I also think that she is
worth of being one of The Seven!

105
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,480
With this,
Ms. Gandesblood's fate has been decided.

106
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,820
Only two people support you.

107
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,950
Do you understand what that means?

108
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,160
How unfortunate!

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,370
Terakomari Gandesblood is
no longer one of The Seven!

110
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,120
I object!

111
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,040
I have an objection!

112
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,460
The majority vote has not yet been cast.

113
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,970
What are you suddenly talking about?
You are a simple maid.

114
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,600
There are two votes for Terakomari
to remain one of The Seven.

115
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,100
We know this much.

116
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,310
However,

117
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,270
we still do not know
how many vote against.

118
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,310
That is self apparent!

119
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,940
It's three! Three people vote against!

120
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,440
Hm, it is true their hands
have not yet risen.

121
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,280
It's not clear there are three votes.

122
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,030
So I ask,

123
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,110
all those who think
Terakomari Gandesblood

124
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,910
is not fit for The Seven, raise your hand.

125
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,290
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

126
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,040
It is two votes against two.

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,920
Del, raise your hand!

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,340
You think Ms. Gandesblood
is annoying too right?

129
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,840
Del, you haven't fallen asleep have you?

130
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,930
Wait, Lord Mascarella!

131
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,220
Lord Delphyne, excuse me.

132
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,270
She's dead!

133
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,980
It's the devil!

134
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,110
How could this be!
This is the work of the devil!

135
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,909
The devil isn't real,
how can you believe that?

136
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,450
It's obvious this is
the work of the terrorist!

137
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,290
I don't think it was.

138
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,500
What do you know about it?

139
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,790
We must start by figuring out where,

140
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,040
when, and by whom she was killed.

141
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,550
What should we do, Vill?

142
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,380
This is turning into some
mystery novel story.

143
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,380
It is quite comical.

144
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,590
They don't know that it was actually me.

145
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,680
Huh?

146
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,640
Lord Delphyne was going to vote
for your dismissal Lady Komari.

147
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,100
So before the meeting I poisoned her

148
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,150
and set her body up in the chair.

149
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,020
There are no wounds on Lord Delphyne.

150
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,990
That must mean she was poisoned.

151
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,450
Who are you suggesting did this?

152
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,620
I figure Lord Gandesblood.

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,490
You would know best wouldn't you?

154
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,750
That's right!

155
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,420
You must have killed Del!

156
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,960
You have motive in
preventing the majority vote!

157
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,340
T-Then show me your evidence!

158
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,550
Without proof it's just conjecture!

159
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,050
Saying Komari is the culprit is
naught more than speculation.

160
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,390
Hmm...

161
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,260
Suppose Komari did kill Delphyne.

162
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,680
What would you intend to do?

163
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,900
I would do this.

164
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,270
Ms. Frête!

165
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,690
Private fights between
The Seven is prohibited.

166
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,940
This isn't a private fight.

167
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,650
This is a formal declaration of war!

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,700
War?

169
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,070
Lady Karen.

170
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,120
It is legal for generals
of the same kingdom

171
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,330
to go to war with each other is it not?

172
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,580
No problem with it at all.

173
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,500
There isn't?

174
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,590
If Ms. Gandesblood loses
she will quit being one of The Seven.

175
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,710
And if I lose...

176
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,960
Let's see...

177
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,549
I'll grant you a single request.

178
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,679
Oh my? You aren't going to
refuse my challenge are you?

179
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,679
O-Of course I won't refuse!

180
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,270
I am the strongest here!

181
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,900
It doesn't matter who my opponent is!

182
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,810
-I accept your ch--
-Wait!

183
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,030
We've convened a meeting of
The Seven and this is the conclusion?

184
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,860
You are too forgiving, Frête Mascarella!

185
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,410
To put not only Terakomari Gandesblood's,

186
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,830
but the newcomer
Sakuna Memoir's skills to the test,

187
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,540
I propose we hold a "Clash of The Seven!"

188
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,290
What was that?

189
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,590
Clash of The Seven?

190
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,090
Sounds interesting!

191
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Lady Karen?

192
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,390
Very well! I will allow
the clash to be held!

193
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,100
As you know a Clash of The Seven

194
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,060
is the greatest
entertaining event put on by The Seven.

195
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,980
To meet the public's expectations

196
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,980
you must fight to the death
and not hold back!

197
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,530
Fight to the death?

198
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,330
In the summer sky,

199
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,170
is that a Komari flower suddenly blooming?

200
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,920
Ha ha, it's good right?

201
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,880
It's a metaphor of me
as a firework, when I explode and die.

202
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,510
Lady Komari, please wake up.

203
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,300
Your supper is ready.

204
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,760
I've lost all emotion.

205
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,720
I'm a lost cause.

206
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,810
Today we are serving a
Demi-glace hamburger steak.

207
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,570
Do you think you can give it your all
in the Clash of The Seven?

208
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,160
Yeah, I'll do my best.

209
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,740
There's no way I can do that!

210
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,330
Why are things always so hard for me?

211
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,960
I didn't even want to be one of The Seven.

212
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,750
Then let me ask you,

213
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,460
what kind of work did you want to do?

214
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,710
I had no intention of working.

215
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
I wanted to be a novelist.

216
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,050
Speaking of which,
you started writing a new book, right?

217
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,680
Yes.

218
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,430
After the meeting yesterday
I wanted some feedback,

219
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,310
so I gave Sakuna a draft.

220
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,690
I told her it was written by a relative.

221
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,150
By the way,
do you use a pen name?

222
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,860
No, I put my real name for now.

223
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,780
Even on your new book?

224
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,110
Yeah, on the back of the
first page of the draft.

225
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,240
Then Lord Memoir knows that you wrote it.

226
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,000
T-That's...

227
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
That's?

228
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,960
That's no good!

229
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,120
Lady Komari!

230
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,840
Big Sister Komari was amazing!

231
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,470
She didn't back down at all to Ms. Frête!

232
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,470
Thank you for the meal.

233
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,440
See you later.
I'll come by again soon.

234
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,820
Father...

235
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
I'll do my best!

236
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,200
To protect my family.

237
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,990
Damn it!

238
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,040
She mustn't! She mustn't read it!

239
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,620
Wait Sakuna!

240
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,180
Farewell, Lord Gandesblood.

241
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm sure you will be happy
in the kingdom of God.

242
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,980
Ms. Terakomari?

243
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,900
Sorry for suddenly showing up.

244
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
About the book I gave you yesterday...

245
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,900
You're soaking wet!
Hurry let's get you changed!

246
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,570
We can't have you catching a cold!

247
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,530
Ah, but my room is a bit of a mess.

248
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,700
I'd appreciate it if you avoid

249
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,950
looking too much in the bedroom.

250
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,290
Seriously?

251
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,880
Sakuna, sorry but do you
have some different clothes?

252
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,920
I just can't wear something
with my own face on...

253
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,010
Huh?

254
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,350
I-It's not what you think!

255
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,730
I swear it isn't!

256
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,610
-Sakuna...
-Ha?

257
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,190
This room sure is something.

258
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,440
There's a lot of me.

259
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,030
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,870
I...I...

261
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,700
I love you Ms. Terakomari.

262
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,040
So that's why you made these souvenirs?

263
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,750
Yes!

264
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,670
I consider these 15
life-sized Terakomari dolls

265
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,920
to be a true masterpiece!

266
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,050
Everyday I greet them and talk to them.

267
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,180
I treat them as I would
the real you, Ms. Terakomari.

268
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,970
I-Is that right?

269
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,810
Well, everyone has their own hobbies.

270
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,350
I also have one or two secrets
I don't want people to know.

271
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,060
Are you talking about
how you write novels?

272
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,530
That's right. Did you see?

273
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,950
Yes, on the back of the
first page of the draft

274
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,320
it had your name.

275
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,620
But, I guess after seeing this room

276
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,830
I feel like it doesn't matter
if you know I write novels.

277
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,720
Ms. Terakomari, I'm worried.

278
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,680
About the Clash of The Seven?

279
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,840
Yes.

280
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,260
Everyone is very strong.

281
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,850
I worry a weakling vampire like myself

282
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,190
will be killed off very quickly.

283
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,150
On top of that,

284
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,980
I don't want to fight you.

285
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,610
Then we should have an alliance.

286
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,530
If you and I work together

287
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,620
we'll already have one less enemy

288
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,240
and we'll have one more partner!

289
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,290
Don't you think it's a great idea?

290
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,540
B-But...

291
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,750
Why are you being so kind to me?

292
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm like

293
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,670
your stalker, or something like that.

294
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,710
We're fr...

295
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,470
It's because we're friends.

296
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,430
Huh?

297
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,850
It's normal for friends
to work together right?

298
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,770
Friends?

299
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,230
Oh sorry. You wouldn't want to
be my friend, I understand.

300
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,730
No, I do!

301
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,110
I'd be honored to be your friend!

302
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,860
I accept our friendship!

303
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,780
Oh, well then.

304
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,990
I appreciate you accepting.

305
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,280
So we are friends...

306
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,910
My first friend.

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,040
That's right!

308
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,290
Let's get Herdeus to work with us too!

309
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Herdeus?

310
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,510
He's a little weird but we can trust him.

311
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,300
Come to think of it, you lived
at his orphanage, right?

312
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,340
Yes.

313
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,390
He took me in
after my whole family was murdered.

314
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,350
Ah, but I do have family.

315
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,690
You mean they were revived by Magic Cores?

316
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,810
If so why do you live by yourself?

317
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,780
They are my family.

318
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,950
My older sister, her name was Komari.

319
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,950
Oh really?
I already feel close to her.

320
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,080
Yes!

321
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,700
She had very beautiful memories

322
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,910
of someone born under Delphinus.

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,880
What do you mean?

324
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,800
I intuitively understand the
shape of people's spirits.

325
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,050
Are you cold? Your hands are freezing.

326
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,720
The Blue Jades do not have bodyheat.

327
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,430
We're called the frozen, iron-clad bodies.

328
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,900
Will you come look at the stars with me?

329
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,520
Sakuna, wait a second.

330
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,900
It's best to see
something beautiful in your last moments.

331
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,240
Her Excellency Terakomari
massacring The Seven...

332
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,830
I can't wait to see it!

333
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,660
Hey, you're part of the 7th unit right?

334
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,120
Yes, that's right.

335
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm a member of the 6th unit.

336
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,380
What do you think when you see that?

337
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,560
For Lady Sakuna!

338
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,680
Glory to Lady Sakuna!

339
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,270
Those men,

340
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,849
they fight to the death yelling

341
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,060
"Lady Sakuna!" from morning to night!

342
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,609
It's strange no matter how you look at it.

343
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,990
It could be that Sakuna Memoir
is just that popular.

344
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,700
There's no way that's true!

345
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,530
Not so long ago that young girl

346
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,490
was a nobody that no
one paid attention to!

347
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,700
It's just...

348
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,210
Sakuna Memoir seriously frightens me.

349
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,670
She's not just a Crimson Commander.

350
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,840
She's something much more sinister!

351
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,180
Looking at the stars like this
really calms you down.

352
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,970
Yeah, it does.

353
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,060
The constellations really are beautiful.

354
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,310
Your memories are organized

355
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,270
just as the constellations of stars.

356
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,900
Oh?

357
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,480
Ms. Terakomari...

358
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,740
Why do you think
the terrorist is killing people?

359
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,070
What?

360
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,870
I think it's likely because
they have to kill.

361
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,200
I guess that is right.

362
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,580
If, for example

363
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,500
a member of your family was
taken hostage by the terrorist

364
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,420
and they told you to kill someone...

365
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,510
what would you do?

366
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,800
I'd defeat the terrorist!

367
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,970
The terrorist holding family hostage
is the one at fault right?

368
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,560
If they're gone
then the problem is solved.

369
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,400
I knew you'd be strong.

370
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,940
If it were me I wouldn't...

371
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,690
What's wrong Sakuna?

372
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,940
Are you hurting?

373
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,360
-Hey.
-Look up at the stars please.

374
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,200
It will be over soon.

375
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,200
Lady Komari.

376
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,710
It is time to come home.

377
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,420
How long have you been there?
You're really a horror!

378
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,880
You work in the morning.

379
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,670
If you stay out late you
won't be able to wake up.

380
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,170
Later Sakuna!

381
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm counting on you for
the Clash of The Seven!

382
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,010
Yes!
Have a good night, Ms. Terakomari!

383
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,350
Yeah, goodnight!

384
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,240
What is wrong? That kind of hurt.

385
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,820
I apologize.

386
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,250
However, I feel that
Sakuna Memoir is dangerous.

387
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,750
For me I feel like
you are way more dangerous.

388
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,420
I felt her intent to kill.

389
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
If ever so slight.

390
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,920
It's just your imagination.

391
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,180
Why didn't you kill her, Sakuna Memoir?

392
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,810
You must do what you can when you can.

393
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,890
That is the motto of the Inverted Moons.

394
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,310
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,860
This calls for a punishment.

396
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,610
How many family members did you have?

397
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,860
I'm asking you how many there were!

398
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,280
There were three!

399
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,450
My father, mother, and my older sister.

400
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,700
Then I'll kill them all.

401
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,410
Every time you fail I will kill them

402
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,410
one by one with my Sacred Article.

403
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,620
If you do not want to lose your family

404
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,880
you must make sure to
kill all of The Seven.

405
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,090
At least one of The Seven knows
where the Magic Cores are.

406
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,220
Using your Rekkaku Liberation

407
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,430
peek into their memories and
find out where they are.

408
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,350
But...

409
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,600
Right, you can't beat
any of The Seven by yourself.

410
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,520
That's why I've prepared
a present for you.

411
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
Take a look at
your beloved Terakomari doll.

412
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,240
Cornelius' secret medicine.

413
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,070
I'm sure you've heard of it.

414
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,410
I have high expectations
for you, Sakuna Memoir.

415
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,540
Don't make the same mistakes
as Millicent Bluenight.

416
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,380
Yes, I understand.

417
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,300
I wish you good luck.

418
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,560
It's too hard and painful.

419
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,600
I want to die.

420
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,020
Why do all of these horrible
things happen to me?

421
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,690
Don't make the same mistakes
as Millicent Bluenight.

422
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,820
Millicent?

423
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,330
We are both vampires,

424
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,290
so we were compared a bit.

425
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
In the Inverted Moons

426
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,000
I didn't have much contact with her.

427
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,590
I wonder

428
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,600
what that blue colored girl is doing now?

429
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,650
What are you doing, Sakuna Memoir?

430
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,210
Have a seat.

431
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,010
You want to talk with me don't you?

432
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,980
