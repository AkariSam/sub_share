1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,120
It's done!

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,210
It's finally done!

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,050
A masterpiece that surpasses
the likes of strawberry milk!

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,840
Is it already this late?

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,170
Time to sleep.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,810
I warmed up the bed for
my tired Lady Komari.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,350
With my naked body.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,610
You pervert maid!

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,940
I'm definitely telling father about this!

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,870
#5: SAKUNA MEMOIR
AND THE RED CRIMSON SKIES

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,170
I can't believe the Empress.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,840
Does she have no decency?
Summoning me out of the blue.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,090
You are so outspoken against
our powerful Empress.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,800
So classic of your Excellency.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,640
I-I know right?

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,050
By the way Chaostel.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,270
Why are you here?

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,640
Yes well,

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,060
actually there is something
I very much wanted to give you.

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,440
Her Excellency's first merch,
Her Excellency's T-Shirt!

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,280
We haven't been able to
give one to you yet.

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,400
Huh?

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,660
Amazing, isn't it?

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,950
These are flying off the shelves.

25
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,120
Whaa?

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,660
Try it on your Excellency.

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,370
It would be weird if I wore it!

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,920
I'd have two heads!

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,630
Double the cuteness!

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,500
Are you stupid?

31
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,090
Even if it rained and I had
nothing else to wear, I wouldn't!

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,009
Come on Vill, say something!

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,759
I already bought 100.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,640
Stop wasting your paychecks!

35
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,020
Ah, is that General
Terakomari Gandesblood?

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,440
I've heard you're on a winning streak.

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,360
The progress of
the 7th Unit is unstoppable.

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,229
Huh?

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,990
However, you're only targeting small fries.

40
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,530
During the battle
you sit in your safe castle,

41
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,070
simple issuing random orders to your men.

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
You are...

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,750
You are a weakling, aren't you?

44
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,710
I'm sorry to ask a little late,
but who are you?

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,130
Who am I?

46
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,220
You really said to me, "Who are you?"

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,800
Excuse me, who might you be?

48
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,930
It's not a matter of how you say it!

49
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,480
You must know I am one of The Seven,

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,230
The "Black Flash" Frête Mascarella!

51
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,820
Another classic move Lady Komari!

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,030
Brashly starting a fight with the most

53
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,530
famous Crimson Commander!

54
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,950
I don't not like it.

55
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,120
You should have told me!
This person is one of The Seven?

56
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,579
It's not often someone tries to
make a fool of me.

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,460
-That's not what I was trying--
-Lady Mascarella.

58
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,960
Please excuse us.

59
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,460
Please take this as our apology.

60
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,130
Oh, "Bloody Manju". You have taste.

61
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,220
What on Earth is this?

62
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,470
Lady Komari is the strongest,

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
and the prettiest in the world.

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,430
Judging from the low-level
provocations

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,310
you just leveled at Lady Komari,

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,030
I figured you didn't know
those facts Lady Mascarella.

67
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,820
Enough already, shut up!

68
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,870
I understand fully Ms. Gandesblood.

69
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,030
It doesn't seem that
we can become friends.

70
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,120
That's not true!

71
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,290
If we cultivate our relationship--

72
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,040
That's impossible while you behave
in such an unpleasant manner.

73
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,420
Unbelievable.

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,380
Just because you're Lady Karen's pet
doesn't mean I'll be nice.

75
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,510
Lady Karen?

76
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,680
Now who is that?

77
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,470
Please don't act stupid!

78
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,850
I know you know the name of
her Majesty the Emperor.

79
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,480
The Emperor has such a cute name?

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Oh, how deplorable!

81
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,860
Is Lady Karen out of her mind?

82
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,820
Why does she favor a vampire like you
who only has a family name.

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,110
She never gives me a second glance!

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,820
What are you talking about?

85
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,410
You don't know about Sakuna Memoir?
You must be joking!

86
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,710
At any rate, I don't approve of you!

87
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,120
If you don't like it,

88
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,630
then show the strength worthy
of being one of The Seven.

89
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,880
I-I'll show you someday.

90
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,880
But not today.

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,680
If you keep putting things off
like that, you'll waste your life!

92
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,310
Gosh, that stings! I don't really
know what she means though.

93
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,600
Good day to you, Ms. Gandesblood.

94
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,390
Next time we meet

95
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,900
I do hope I get to see your true strength.

96
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,620
You're finally here Komari!

97
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,040
It's hot outside isn't it?
Cool off with some ice cream!

98
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,170
Tangerine flavored, it's so good!

99
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,720
Enough, hurry up and tell
me what you want, Empress!

100
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,140
You're so impatient.

101
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,720
By the way, how did that
forced indirect kiss taste?

102
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,850
Don't be so creepy!
I only tasted tangerine!

103
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,890
Wasn't it so nice, sweet and sour!

104
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,610
By the way, someone
beat your father to death last night.

105
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,860
I said hurry up and tell me...

106
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,650
WHAA?

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,950
Don't worry, the Magic Core
will revive him before tonight.

108
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,780
I know, but still...

109
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,620
On his way home from yesterday's
Imperial Council meeting,

110
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,540
they pierced his stomach with bare hands.

111
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,710
The problem isn't just Armand.

112
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,500
Five government officials were
killed this week as well.

113
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,840
And one of those was a Crimson Commander.

114
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,340
This is the act of a terrorist.

115
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,390
None of the vampires killed
knew that they had died.

116
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,770
Of course they also do not
remember the killer's face.

117
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,810
You mean they use some kind
of memory manipulating magic?

118
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,900
That is definitely possible.

119
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,860
I think this may not be magic
but instead Rekkaku Liberation.

120
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,740
Rekkaku Liberation...

121
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,530
That makes things difficult.

122
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,950
You're exactly right.

123
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,200
I've got a bad feeling about this.

124
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,750
For a long time it has been the role of

125
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,580
a Crimson Commander to solve
these types of issues.

126
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,170
Komari!

127
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,790
What?

128
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,590
I want you to kill the terrorist.

129
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,460
No, no, no!

130
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,340
-Lady Komari, please calm down.
-No, no, shut up!

131
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,760
All I do is work, I hate it!

132
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,300
You are one of The Seven, you must.

133
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,600
Just because I'm one of The Seven
I have to work with no break?

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,390
You are one of The Seven, so yes.

135
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,770
-I won't! I want a break!
-I'll give you a vacation then.

136
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,770
What do you mean?

137
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,730
I do feel a little sorry
for you after all.

138
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,780
If you can catch the terrorist,

139
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,860
I'll give you one week of vacation!

140
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,370
But there's no way I can
catch the terrorist.

141
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,159
Don't worry!

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm not giving you this
mission by yourself.

143
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,830
You don't need to be shy, Sakuna Memoir!

144
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,770
You're beautiful.

145
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,350
I-I'm sorry, it just slipped out.

146
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,320
You don't need to apologize.

147
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,690
I am the most beautiful girl
in the last 100 million years.

148
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,570
Ahem!

149
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,280
This terrorist is so skilled
they even killed one of The Seven.

150
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,659
So I want the two of you
to work together to carry out the mission.

151
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,290
Empress, I know it's not my
place but even if this girl--

152
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,210
No need to worry.

153
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,630
This girl has a strong urge to
take revenge on the terrorist.

154
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,090
Revenge?

155
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,930
Sakuna!

156
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,060
I'm Sakuna Memoir, one of The Seven.

157
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,730
I'm one of The Seven
but I was killed by the terrorist.

158
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,560
I must redeem my honor.

159
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,070
One of The Seven? This girl?

160
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,070
It's too embarrassing so
read it later please.

161
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,700
I'll be one my way now!

162
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,530
This is...

163
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,870
If other people saw this
they'd get the wrong idea.

164
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,130
To Terakomari Gandesblood.

165
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,970
Sorry for suddenly
handing you this letter.

166
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,010
It's just,

167
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,179
I didn't think I could tell you
all of this in person.

168
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,150
The only thing I could do
was write it all down.

169
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,860
My name is Sakuna Memoir.

170
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,740
My hobby is to read books.

171
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I'd love it if you felt free enough
to call me Sakuna.

172
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,040
I accidentally killed one of the
previous Crimson Commanders,

173
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,250
so that is why I was
promoted to the title.

174
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,960
That's how I took over the position.

175
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,800
As a member of The Seven
I know I am lacking.

176
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,550
Even if I want to quit, I cannot.

177
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,390
As you know, if you quit
being one of The Seven

178
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,100
you explode and permanently die.

179
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,640
Me being killed by a terrorist

180
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,430
has harmed the name of the Empire.

181
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,150
My fate of exploding is one step closer.

182
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,570
That's why I have to
capture the terrorist.

183
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,740
This is all I wanted to tell you.

184
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,870
This may not be something I should say to

185
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,950
someone as strong
and amazing as you, Ms. Terakomari.

186
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,160
But for some reason,

187
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,830
I felt like I needed to tell you this Ms.
Terakomari.

188
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,250
That's why I wrote this
letter, however weak it is.

189
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,130
I may be unworthy of
The Seven, and incompetent,

190
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,220
but I do hope we can be friends.

191
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,180
I will do my very best!

192
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,010
What's up with this girl?
She's too cute!

193
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,180
Lady Komari, these kind of
princesses are your taste?

194
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,600
My taste?
I guess I do like it.

195
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,030
Alright, I'm going to find Sakuna!

196
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,610
If you are going to meet Lord Memoir,

197
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,450
it must be for a proper meeting
concerning catching the terrorist.

198
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,000
But if you think about it there's
nothing I can really do for that.

199
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,750
It's a terrorist who has already
killed a bunch of people.

200
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,630
Then you should use your soldiers.

201
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,460
Lady Komari, you realize you have
500 brutal soldiers at your order?

202
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,010
Ah, but...

203
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
They seem so busy.

204
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,270
It will be okay.
Come now, give your order.

205
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,770
Men, do you have a second?

206
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,190
Lady Terakomari now has an order for you.

207
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,900
-Everyone open your ears!
-I won't miss a word!

208
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,740
-Who should we kill?
-Your Excellency.

209
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,580
Is this about the case of serial murders?

210
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,580
Yes...

211
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,450
I've actually received an
order from the Empress.

212
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,250
Apparently she wants me to catch
the terrorist culprit at fault.

213
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm sorry to request this
while you all are so busy,

214
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,260
but I want you men to help!

215
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,470
Stop it, you're going
to upset the neighbors!

216
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,810
Your Excellency, how about giving a prize

217
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,890
to the one who catches the terrorist?

218
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,560
Their morale will increase
one hundred fold!

219
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,060
A prize?

220
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,690
I've got it!

221
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,730
I'll give a special three day holiday

222
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
to the one who catches the terrorist!

223
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,950
Huh?

224
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,330
Your Excellency...

225
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm afraid that isn't a
prize for these men.

226
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,250
Huh? Why?

227
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,920
Their hobby is to kill.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,670
If you give them time off

229
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,130
then they aren't in the
battlefield and they feel lost.

230
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,170
Just look at them.

231
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,090
Look at the growing
expressions of despair!

232
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,970
That's no good.
They might start a mutiny!

233
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,350
It-It's not your normal holiday!

234
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,350
On the holiday

235
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,020
I'll be giving you these
tickets to the zoo!

236
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,030
Um, do you mean we can
go with your Excellency?

237
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,030
Well, if that's what you want.

238
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,700
-A date!
-It's a holiday date!

239
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,080
Lady Komari!

240
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,870
Don't you think that's going too far?

241
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,250
Huh? What do you mean?

242
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,210
-A date!
-Terrorists target government officials

243
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,840
we can just kill the
government officials first.

244
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,590
I'm going to be the one who goes

245
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,760
on a date with Her Excellency!

246
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,850
I think those guys are
the real terrorists.

247
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,850
-Excuse us!
-That's the worst impression possible!

248
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,230
Ms. Terakomari?

249
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,270
H-Hey Sakuna.
Sorry to drop by so suddenly.

250
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,900
I came for the meeting
about killing the terrorists.

251
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,280
Were you in the middle of something?

252
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,450
No, no, not a problem at all.

253
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,200
I was just leaving.

254
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,950
Well then Lord Memoir,
I look forward to your full cooperation.

255
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,410
Yes.

256
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,540
I'm very glad to make your
acquaintance, Lord Gandesblood.

257
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,750
By the way, do you believe in God?

258
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,590
Huh? Uh, well as much as the next guy.

259
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,590
Oh! Another person of faith!

260
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,560
Your great success is due to
you being a devout follower of God.

261
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,760
When you have some time

262
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,560
I would like to have a full discussion
about all of God's creations.

263
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,980
Until then!

264
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,530
May God keep you!

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,070
Sakuna, do you know that guy?

266
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,120
That man is Herdeus Heaven.

267
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,530
One of The Seven.

268
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,200
-He's a Crimson Commander too?
-Yes.

269
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,040
But he is also a Priest.

270
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,460
He runs a church and orphanage
on the capital's outskirts.

271
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,210
Lord Memoir is from
that orphanage as well.

272
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,420
Oh, I see.

273
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,380
It's noon?

274
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,390
Um, Sakuna if you'd like

275
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,970
shall we eat lunch together?

276
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,270
Yes, I'd love to
if you want to, Ms. Terakomari.

277
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,110
-It's Lord Gandesblood.
-In the flesh!

278
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,520
I can feel the aura of murder.

279
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,320
Maybe we shouldn't have
come to this restaurant.

280
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,950
Um, did you read the letter?

281
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,950
Yes, I like reading books too!

282
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,290
I think we're really similar, Sakuna.

283
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,750
Yes, I'm so glad!

284
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,380
But about the other stuff...

285
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,960
What do you think about the way
I became one of The Seven?

286
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,550
Right...

287
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,760
For reference, how exactly did it happen?

288
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,760
When I was practicing some of my magic

289
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,480
it accidentally hit a member of
The Seven passing by and he died.

290
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,850
O-Oh...

291
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,610
Then Mr. Herdeus
recommended me for The Seven.

292
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,440
He appealed to Her Majesty the Empress

293
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,820
and for some reason she accepted.

294
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,950
I see.

295
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,620
But the hard part is you have to
hide your true amount of power.

296
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,870
If your soldiers learn that
you are weak, they might mutiny.

297
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,790
That's not true for me.

298
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,920
All of my soldiers know
that I am not that strong.

299
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,470
But they support me so that I can continue

300
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,010
being one of The Seven.

301
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,720
That's why I want to stop

302
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,350
but I feel like I have to try my best.

303
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,770
What, I'm so jealous!

304
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,770
Ms. Terakomari, you're amazing.

305
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,110
Unlike me, you are
a really active member of The Seven.

306
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,570
It's like this is your calling!

307
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,700
Lady Komari.

308
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,120
I think you should start the work meeting.

309
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,540
T-That's right, umm...

310
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,290
It seems the criminal uses
Rekkaku Liberation to manipulate memory.

311
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,800
Lord Memoir, have you heard
of Rekkaku Liberation?

312
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,920
Yes, I've heard rumors.

313
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,680
Rekkaku Liberation differs from magic

314
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,680
as it’s an absolute supernatural ability.

315
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,220
If the terrorist really can
use a Rekkaku Liberation,

316
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,850
there is no such thing
as too much caution.

317
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,310
Um, I'm very weak.
Are you sure we'll be okay?

318
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,980
There's no need to worry.

319
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,570
I'll protect you, Sakuna.

320
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,070
Really? I'm so sorry.

321
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,870
I only have strength enough
to crush an apple in my hand.

322
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,790
I should be able to crush
a watermelon right?

323
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,080
Wasn't Sakuna originally
a human from around here?

324
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,840
Either way it's not good to waste food.

325
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,710
Oh, right!

326
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,720
Although the aims and means
of the terrorist are unknown,

327
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,010
they only take action at night.

328
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,430
They also only operate
in the Mulnite Palace.

329
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,810
That means we will need to
patrol the palace at night.

330
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,730
A night-time patrol?

331
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,230
You mean no work during the day?

332
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,020
We can sleep during the day?

333
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,150
What are you saying?

334
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,319
We work during the day
and during the night.

335
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,990
You must work from 9am to 8pm.

336
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,780
You must be joking!
There's no way I'm working that much!

337
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,700
Lady Komari.

338
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,579
What is it?

339
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,619
You're drawing attention to yourself.

340
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,290
That must disqualify her from The Seven?

341
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,839
It's possible it was just
a slip of the tongue.

342
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,670
Wouldn't that be even worse?

343
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,880
You must be joking!

344
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,510
There's no way I'm working so little!

345
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,350
Even kids are awake before 8am!

346
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,180
If we don't patrol even later,

347
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,810
then how can we expect to
catch the cunning terrorist?

348
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,060
I'm so impressed!

349
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,570
Well then, from today
onward we will be patrolling

350
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,070
together until 10pm everyday.

351
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,780
You don't have to, Lord Memoir.

352
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,370
It's okay! I'll learn from Ms. Terakomari
and do my best!

353
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,950
What was that?

354
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,160
It can't be!
The terrorists?

355
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,040
Belius! Chaostel!

356
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,920
What happened to you all?

357
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,300
I'm sorry Your Excellency, she...

358
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,590
Come on, Belius!

359
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,770
He's recovering? That's amazing Sakuna!

360
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,480
You think so?

361
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,650
Belius, are you okay?

362
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,030
Yes, I'll be fine.

363
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,660
Your Excellency, I apologize!
It was Frête Mascarella!

364
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,080
We all fell before her.

365
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,290
Woo!

366
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,590
Oh ho!

367
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,960
Hey Melakonsi!
What are you doing?

368
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,510
Yeeeaaah!

369
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,550
♪Frête's angry, on a rampage!♪

370
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,640
♪Shaking rage, more wrinkles with age♪

371
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,680
♪The Black Flash, get real!
I'll take you to hell for real!♪

372
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,100
Just speak normally!

373
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,900
She attacked us so I was fighting her.

374
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,190
You can talk normally?

375
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,980
Such terrible things to say.

376
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,610
All I was doing was fulfilling my duties.

377
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,740
Frête. What is happening?

378
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,450
Depending on your answer--

379
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,500
Oh?

380
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,000
So Ms. Memoir is the first to react?

381
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,760
I don't think you should
so suddenly attack like that.

382
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,640
My hand just slipped for a second.

383
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,050
I'm so sorry.

384
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,100
You could have easily blocked
such an attack Ms. Terakomari.

385
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,390
What? Oh yeah your right.

386
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,690
But you did save me just then,
thank you Sakuna.

387
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,770
Oh, such great praise!

388
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,650
How is this girl so cute?

389
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,740
What are you doing?

390
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,570
What are you saying my men did?

391
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,040
Damage to property, attempted murder...

392
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,460
All of your soldiers laying dead there

393
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,460
were rampaging recklessly
throughout the palace.

394
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,340
I simply stopped them!

395
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,800
Unbelievable!

396
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,840
Not only do you lack strength

397
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,510
but you have trouble
managing your own troops?

398
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,810
Never before has there been such
a worthless Crimson Commander.

399
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,770
I've made up my mind.
I will submit a motion of no confidence

400
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,610
in Terakomari Gandesblood
as a member of The Seven.

401
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,830
I look forward to what
their decision will be.

402
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,510
I see...

403
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,680
It seems she's finally
eaten the "Bloody Manju."

404
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,800
What do you mean?

405
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,930
My Rekkaku Liberation, "Pandora Poison"

406
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,770
allows me to see the future
of those who drink my blood.

407
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,980
Their future?

408
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,190
When I gave them to Lord Mascarella

409
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,610
I put some of my blood into them.

410
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,190
So, what happens?

411
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,860
Three days from now
when Lady Komari is denounced

412
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,280
at the Crimson Sky Council,
a vote will be called

413
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,950
and The Seven will decide.

414
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,200
As a result,

415
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,040
Lady Komari will explode.

416
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,710
No way!

417
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,580
It's true.

418
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,380
Tell me you're lying!

419
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,960
It will be okay!

420
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,550
If there is a vote I
will side with you, Ms. Terakomari!

421
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,470
Sakuna!

422
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,140
Sakuna, you are such a good girl!

423
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,680
Oh sorry, I didn't mean to.
Did that upset you?

424
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,020
I'm not upset. I was happy!

425
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,270
It's like I have a big sister.

426
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Ahh! I've also

427
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,610
always wanted a little
sister like you Sakuna!

428
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,650
Oh really?

429
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,490
Big Sister Komari!

430
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,500
-Keep calling me that!
-Big Sister Komari!

431
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,000
Lady Komari this isn't the time to flirt.

432
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,050
Even if Lord Memoir backs you,
there are five other Commanders.

433
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,470
The majority of which likely hold
grudges against you Lady Komari.

434
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,890
What should we do?

435
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,890
Leave it to me.

436
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,430
O-Oh, really?

437
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,060
I'm a good girl too.

438
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,270
Um, Ms. Terakomari.

439
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,810
Do you not like to fight?

440
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,980
Huh? W-W-Why do you ask?

441
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,240
I mean, a normal Crimson Commander

442
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,110
would solve this kind of
problem with more violence.

443
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,410
If someone like Ms. Frête came along

444
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,000
they'd silence them by
showing their strength.

445
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,500
O-Of course that is the
most effective method.

446
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,340
But I'm someone who
doesn't fight when it isn't necessary.

447
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,550
I would like to resolve things
through discussion if possible.

448
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,350
Oh, I thought so!

449
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,940
ROGUES AT THE ROUND TABLE
