1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,960
Sakuna Memoir.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,170
Yes!

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,970
Why are you wearing
that disgusting t-shirt?

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,140
Are you mocking me?

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,430
I would never mock you.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,180
I like these clothes very much.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,350
-I can give you some too, Millicent.
-I don't want it!

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,980
The people who worship Terakomari
are all simply idiots.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,070
So, what do you want?

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,360
Umm, actually...

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,660
Why are you here?

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,660
Shouldn't you be in prison?

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,660
I was until recently.

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,210
Now I'm allowed to go out.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,830
Allowed to?

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,250
Why is that?

17
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,590
There's a lot going on.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,800
So you want to leave
the Inverted Moons?

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,470
How did you...

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,600
I can tell by looking at you.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,270
And you have
no other reason to come see me.

22
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,150
Speaking of which,

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,110
your family is being held hostage
by the Inverted Moons, right?

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,870
Shouldn't you be
asking Terakomari for help?

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,539
You could put to work her insolent
sense of justice to help you.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,080
I can't let her get
involved with my problems.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,630
You don't have the courage
to do what it takes, do you?

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,850
If all else fails

29
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,180
have Terakomari drink some blood.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,400
-Hey, hey over here!
-Bring more drinks!

31
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,280
We thank you for your patience.

32
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,370
The Clash of The Seven will now commence!

33
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,670
As a special rule this time,

34
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,790
they will compete for control

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,170
of a ruby placed in the castle ruins.

36
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,050
The winner shall be the one in control

37
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,180
of the ruby at sunset, marking
the end of the clash.

38
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,970
Also this time around

39
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,720
the ranking of all six
members will be decided

40
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,350
by the number of points earned by the end.

41
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,190
One point for killing an enemy soldier.

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,320
But for killing a member of
The Seven, they get 50 points!

43
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,030
Whoever comes in last place

44
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,950
will resign from The Seven!

45
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,200
Each commander may lead
up to 100 soldiers!

46
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,120
Each general's military strength
and leadership will be tested!

47
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,750
The winner will receive a reward
from Her Majesty the Emperor!

48
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,750
Let's watch as they kill each other
to their hearts content!

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,839
Vill, I want to go home.

50
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,560
If so you'll be disqualified,
resign from The Seven and explode.

51
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,560
Aren't we missing some people?

52
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,860
There's only around 30 soldiers.

53
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,770
Did they oversleep?

54
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,110
-No.
-Then what?

55
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,200
They fought to the death to be selected

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,820
and out of 500 soldiers

57
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,950
470 ended up dying.

58
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,700
They're idiots!

59
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,370
Lady Komari.

60
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,670
How are you doing

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,670
Ms. Terakomari Gandesblood?

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,800
Frête?

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,090
I guess you deserve credit
for not running away.

64
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,300
But today is the day that I will

65
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,970
expose you for the
pathetic person you are.

66
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,140
Oh no, are you too scared to say anything?

67
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,690
If you cry and beg for your
life, I'll go easy on you.

68
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,900
At best you'll have to count
on your men to protect you.

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,320
Well, the savages of the 7th Corps would

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,860
be instantly killed by my elite 3rd Corps.

71
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,830
Your Excellency.

72
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,450
Do you mind if we attack?

73
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,790
Sure, do your best.

74
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,210
That little girl!

75
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,710
Lady Frête, what are you orders?

76
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,840
Advance all troops to the south!

77
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,180
Ms. Gandesblood is only thinking
about protecting herself.

78
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,520
She's obviously
going to fortify her position,

79
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,310
hiding behind her troops.

80
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,190
Lady Mascarella!
An urgent message.

81
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,440
The entire 7th Corps is marching
on us at breakneck speed!

82
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,610
Huh?

83
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,740
We're going to kill Frête Mascarella!

84
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,160
Isn't it strange for the whole army

85
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,460
to charge without their commander?

86
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,920
Ah, that's right.

87
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,510
You're the only one who stayed behind.

88
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,380
I'm relying on you, Bucephalus.

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,930
I want you to
prepare yourself, Bucephalus.

90
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,390
If you let Lady Komari die

91
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,220
I'll turn you into dinner stew.

92
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,390
You stop it!

93
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,140
It's a joke.

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,650
Anyway, we should be meeting up
with Sakuna's 6th Corps quickly.

95
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,030
To do so, we must break through

96
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,650
Lord Delphyne's forces in the southeast.

97
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,490
If we go at them from
the front, we'll die.

98
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,409
This is from our scout, Captain Melakonsi.

99
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,500
Herdeus and Odilon forces are
fighting on the west side.

100
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,670
If we go now, we'll die in the crossfire.

101
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,880
Then where are you saying we should go?

102
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,010
It's Delphyne's army.

103
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,430
They are coming straight this way.

104
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,140
Huh?

105
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,570
Without a doubt they want
to kill you Lady Komari.

106
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,110
I feel the desire for revenge.

107
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,780
Why?
What did I do?

108
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,570
At the meeting of The Seven

109
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,240
everyone thinks you were
the one who killed Lord Delphyne.

110
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,290
All false charges!

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,540
We need to go Lady Komari.
If we stay here we'll die.

112
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,460
I want to go home.

113
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,510
Lady Komari, you shouldn't touch me there.

114
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Just shut it!
Hurry up and go, you perverted maid!

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,890
Commander Terakomari has

116
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,180
sent her whole force at Commander Frête,

117
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,350
leaving her a single horse
against Delphyne's army.

118
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,070
Now, in the midst of the chaos,

119
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,230
the 6th Corps has yet to make a move.

120
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,700
We haven't yet seen a trace
of Commander Sakuna.

121
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,830
Um, what should I do?

122
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,160
You think I know?

123
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,790
Think for yourself,
you worthless commander!

124
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,330
Ah, that guy has a temper.

125
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,040
You bastard!
You think you can die--

126
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,510
Um, what was that call all about?

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,760
I thought we had an alliance

128
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,220
with Terakomari Gandesblood?

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
That's right.

130
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,600
But it doesn't matter, does it?

131
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,020
I have to save Ms. Terakomari.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,480
But to do that...

133
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,740
Our target is Frête Mascarella.

134
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,080
Capture her and present her before me.

135
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,670
Did you see that Armand?
That's a Rekkaku Liberation.

136
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,250
There's no mistaking it.

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,090
Without a doubt,
Sakuna Memoir is the culprit

138
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,210
murdering government officials.

139
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,430
-We'll capture he--
-Just hold on.

140
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,800
If we intervene now,
all we'll get is the lizard's tail.

141
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,520
Could it be, someone is
pulling the strings behind Sakuna Memoir?

142
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,020
That's exactly right.

143
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,400
That person is a part
of the Inverted Moons

144
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,650
and they're on that battlefield right now.

145
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,410
I'm done with this, let's go home Vill!

146
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,580
It's okay, let's keep heading west.

147
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,330
No, no, no, no!

148
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,160
Let's run out of the battlefield!

149
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,370
You want to explode?

150
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,630
I don't want to explode!

151
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,380
What is that?

152
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,050
You think you can get away?

153
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,070
This isn't good.

154
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,610
Gandesblood...

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,780
Are you the one who killed me?

156
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,660
No, you actually weren't killed...

157
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,080
It was probably food poisoning!

158
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,330
Stop lying.

159
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,710
It's not a lie!

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
Maybe you ate a potato that was sprouting?

161
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,380
All you say are lies.

162
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,510
Your words, your history

163
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,680
even your abilities are lies.

164
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,720
Lies, lies, all lies.

165
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,100
What do you think you're doing?

166
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,360
The blood...

167
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,950
Lady Komari...

168
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
Lady Komari!

169
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,910
You masked pervert!

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,170
How dare you touch Lady
Komari's soft skin!

171
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,260
Vill!

172
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,640
No...

173
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,890
Lady Komari, please run!

174
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,060
I can't leave you behind!

175
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,390
How dare you hurt Vill!

176
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,900
You're cheating with all your projectiles!

177
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,610
What's with the mask?
You some kind of pervert?

178
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,610
Isn't it cowardly to use blood to attack?

179
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,070
Your provocations do not work on me.

180
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,950
But it is outrageous for
you to call me a coward.

181
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,200
Prepare yourself.

182
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,960
You cocky little bitch!

183
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,930
Bucephalus!

184
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,260
You won't get away.

185
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,810
We're going to hit the wall!

186
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,310
Hold on tight Lady Komari!

187
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,110
Are you okay?

188
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,110
Aren't you overdoing it?

189
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,700
I'm okay.

190
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,370
The scales of the red dragon
can repel even iron swords.

191
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,170
You're amazing, Bucephalus!

192
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,210
It's a straight shot to the castle!

193
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,420
You're right!

194
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,050
-Suppose making the stew would be a shame.
-Of course you can't!

195
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,590
They're not human!

196
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,260
Lady Komari, I can see it.

197
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,350
Oh!

198
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,440
Isn't that Lord Gandesblood?

199
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,020
Gandesblood? Seize her!

200
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,980
Yeah!

201
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,860
Commander Terakomari

202
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,110
has brought Delphyne's forces to

203
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,030
the west of the castle ruins

204
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,990
where Herdeus' and
Odilon's forces are engaged!

205
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,000
What a bold strategy!

206
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,170
It's no good, we're going
to definitely die!

207
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,840
You can't lose hope, Lady Komari.

208
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,050
Leave it up to me.

209
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,350
Why?

210
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,230
Was that poison?

211
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,900
We're going to die too!

212
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,990
Don't worry, it's poison
gas that only kills men.

213
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,240
You can do that?

214
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,320
Let's quickly destroy the ruby.

215
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,280
That way they won't be able
to tell who won or lost.

216
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,120
Die, die, die!

217
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,040
You lying little bitch!

218
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,000
She's shaking off the furious pursuit

219
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,960
as Commander Terakomari
arrives at the castle!

220
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,000
Is victory close?

221
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,420
Like hell it is!

222
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,270
Vill, take a break!

223
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,810
I'll go on alone.

224
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,070
I'm not letting you escape.

225
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Damn it, what should I do?

226
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,660
I'll be okay.

227
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,070
-Please run Lady Komari.
-You idiot!

228
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,410
I don't need you to sacrifice yourself!

229
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,750
-You run away with me--
-I'm not letting that happen.

230
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,310
You sure are a stubborn bunch.

231
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,340
All right then.

232
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,800
I will erase you all into the darkness.

233
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,310
That magic power...

234
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,980
Her Excellency!

235
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,650
Komari! Komari! Komari!

236
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,630
What was that?

237
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,510
That's shimmering class magic!

238
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,300
"The Dawn Piercing Hell!"

239
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,810
I never thought I'd live to see this!

240
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,560
This isn't a laughing matter.

241
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,850
Komari's used
her Rekkaku Liberation again...

242
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,690
Come on, no need to worry.

243
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,700
Huh?

244
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,040
I was running from
Delphyne's attack...

245
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,710
Then, what happened?

246
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,380
That's right!
Vill!

247
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,970
Where are you?

248
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,010
Vill!

249
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,600
Good, she's still alive.

250
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,230
Thank you.

251
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,350
I'll send you to the
hospital, get some rest.

252
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,859
What is this?

253
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
A dream?

254
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,119
Wait, is this...?

255
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,579
Ms. Gandesblood...

256
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,839
How nice to see you.

257
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,380
Frête!

258
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,130
What happened to the others?

259
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,050
Are you alone?

260
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,600
Alone?

261
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,390
Yes, that's right!

262
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
You massacred everyone!

263
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,690
Huh?

264
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,270
Lord Heaven, Lord Metal,

265
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,270
Lord Memoir, and Delphyne!

266
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,020
What are you saying?

267
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,280
I don't understand!

268
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,110
You used a huge bomb, didn't you?

269
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,070
There's no way you're able to use

270
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
magic with such destructive power!

271
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm telling you...

272
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Is that the ruby?

273
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,750
You can't have!

274
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not what you think,
I didn't break it!

275
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,710
You've got to be kidding!

276
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,760
You only want to save yourself

277
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,470
so you break the ruby

278
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,590
and try to ruin the clash!

279
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,890
No, that's wrong!

280
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,390
By the time I came to it was destroyed!

281
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,640
You are a cancer to the empire!

282
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,770
I refuse to let you go around
doing as you please anymore!

283
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,650
I don't want to be killed!

284
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,820
Then fight back like a warrior would!

285
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,830
Dark Magic...

286
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,620
"Darkness Arma--"

287
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,120
Thank goodness.

288
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,740
I finally found you.

289
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,710
Y-Yeah.

290
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,370
I'm glad you're safe, Sakuna.

291
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,290
Though...

292
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,170
Sakuna, have you...

293
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,510
Have you always been that strong?

294
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,090
I'm not strong.

295
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,470
Ms. Frête let her guard down.

296
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,390
But Sakuna, you are a sorceress right?

297
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,480
You punched through her
with your bare hand.

298
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,390
You're able to do that?

299
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,310
Anyone can do that.

300
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,360
At least a normal vampire.

301
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,520
I-I see.

302
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Right.

303
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,610
Now almost all of The Seven have died.

304
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,130
Do you remember?

305
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,720
Huh?

306
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,300
The night we watched the stars together.

307
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,430
The question that I asked you.

308
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,890
That's when you said

309
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,070
you would defeat
the terrorist threatening you.

310
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,440
I thought that was amazing.

311
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,780
Sakuna...

312
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,240
Looking at everything,

313
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,740
I realize your words were
not pretentious or vain

314
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,410
but it was really you speaking the truth.

315
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,750
What are you saying?

316
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,590
But I can't be like you.

317
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,670
With my lack of strength

318
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm no match for the Inverted Moons.

319
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,970
No matter how hard I try,

320
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,140
no matter how loyal I am to them,

321
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,850
no matter how much I beg them to stop

322
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,270
they'll still kill the people that I love.

323
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,350
There was nothing that I could do.

324
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,980
Because I don't have strength or courage.

325
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,280
Because I don't want to be killed.

326
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,240
I only have one choice.

327
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,870
I always have and I always will

328
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,000
have to work hard as
one of the cogs of the Inverted Moons.

329
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,620
Ms. Frête also

330
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,130
doesn't know where the magic cores are.

331
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,180
Ms. Terakomari, I'm so sorry.

332
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,600
The terrorist...

333
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,770
was me all along.

334
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
Sakuna...

335
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,980
Are you crying?

336
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,520
Are you hurt somewhere?

337
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,690
Why are you worried about me?

338
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,820
I'm a terrorist of the Inverted Moons!

339
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,030
Stop joking around!

340
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,990
If you are crying then
let's go home together.

341
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,910
Even if I want to go home I can't.

342
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,540
I wanted you to
know the truth, Ms. Terakomari.

343
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,500
It would be unfortunate to
have to kill each other

344
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,550
without knowing.

345
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,920
Mental Magic

346
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,180
"Mind Refrain."

347
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,480
Rotating Asterism
