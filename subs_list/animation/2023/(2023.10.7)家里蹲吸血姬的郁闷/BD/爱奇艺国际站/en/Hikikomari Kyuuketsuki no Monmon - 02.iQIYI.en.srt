1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,470
Yes?

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,230
So what am I doing today?

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,960
Hereafter,

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,330
you will have a meeting

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,090
-with a bunch of executive-level thugs.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,250
Did you say thugs?

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,840
Don't you mean bugs?

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,390
Well then,

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,750
let's get you changed.

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,370
Hey! No!

11
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,560
Hey. Stop it!

12
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,520
Not my underwear!

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,640
So anyways,

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,610
let me ask you a question.

15
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,730
What do you gentlemen want to

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,680
do from now on?

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,410
Endless war.

18
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,650
LIEUTENANT BELIUS INNU CERBERUS
DEMOTED FOR MURDER

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,870
I would like to see
Your Excellency in action.

20
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,120
LIEUTENANT CHAOSTEL CONTE
DEMOTED ON SUSPICION OF KIDNAPPING A GIRL

21
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,380
A rap battle with Her Excellency.

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,330
CAPTAIN MELAKONSI
DEMOTED FOR ATTEMPTING TO BLOW UP THE PALACE

23
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,860
I, uh, I see.

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,840
Anyway, I want war.

25
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,660
That is correct.

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,390
Now then...

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,480
We'll move on to
the reward time with Lady Terakomari.

28
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,350
Huh?

29
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,980
Her Excellency appreciated
the effort you all made

30
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,230
in the recent battle against Laperico,

31
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,600
and has decided to reward you accordingly.

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,820
Your Excellency is the best model.

33
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,510
Though I still would like to do this,

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and increase the variety of outfits.

35
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,620
That's death penalty for you!

36
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,950
I think they'd look great on you, though.

37
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,070
You're still getting executed!

38
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,920
My request is

39
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,030
put on hold for now.

40
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:34,880
Yes.

41
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,229
Yeah!

42
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,930
Rap battle!

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,530

"#2 REBELLION ERUPTS"

57
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,780
The one called Terakomari Gandesblood

58
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,470
is one hell of a black box.

59
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,600
What's that?

60
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,920
It's a secret court document.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,590
Three years ago

62
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,960
the whole empire was in an uproar.

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,220
The 'Imperial Academy Attack'.

64
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,140
It holds the details of that.

65
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:00,990
Hey,

66
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,390
why do you have that?

67
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,470
The one responsible for that incident

68
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,320
was Her Excellency.

69
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,960
What?

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
According to this document,

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,350
Thirty people died on the academy's side,

72
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,070
and from the deployed
 Imperial Army's 3rd unit,

73
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,880
seventy deaths.

74
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,829
All were killed with just a pinky finger.

75
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,589
By the way, as a child

76
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,950
Lady Komari murdered
a hundred vampires with her pinky.

77
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,540
Hold it.

78
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,050
I'm pretty sure
the culprit in that case was someone else.

79
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,270
The culprit was switched.

80
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,120
Instead of being reported
as Terakomari Gandesblood,

81
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,409
it was reported under
the unrelated name Millicent Bluenight.

82
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,600
I don't get it.

83
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,800
I don't understand either.

84
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,480
But

85
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,650
her Excellency Terakomari

86
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,040
committed an unparalleled

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,340
massacre three years ago.

88
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,520
That's the fact.

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,720
Hey, you there, woman.

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,030
No outsiders can enter the palace

91
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,410
unless they want to get killed.

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,670
The palace is surprisingly well-guarded.

93
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,340
I thought I'd drop by the Empress' castle

94
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,670
and kill her,

95
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,860
but I couldn't get in
because of the barrier magic.

96
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,320
You!

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,270
Are you targeting the Empress?

98
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,220
I'll kill her eventually.

99
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,190
But now is not the time.

100
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,380
Oh?

101
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Then, why did you come?

102
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,130
It's nothing big.

103
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,170
I just came to check on something.

104
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,640
I read in the newspaper that

105
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,940
Terakomari Gandesblood became
one of the the Seven Crimson Skies.

106
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,130
Is that true?

107
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,850
That magic is too weak.

108
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,510
That's all you got?

109
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,950
Above you!

110
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,240
Where are you looking?

111
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,680
You guys can't stop me.

112
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,130
That's a good thing to have learned.

113
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,580
Send my regards to Terakomari.

114
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,840
See ya.

115
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,470
She's after Her Excellency

116
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,400
What do we do?

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,050
No need to ask that.

118
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,520
To receive the reward of

119
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,010
a ticket to lick Her Excellency's feet,

120
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,480
we'll take the initiative

121
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
and finish that woman off.

122
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,060
Hmph.

123
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,310
That's right.

124
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,230
Oh, so you're also
aiming for the feet licking ticket!

125
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,730
No! I was agreeing to take the initiative!

126
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,330
Good morning, Lady Komari.

127
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,230
Ah, Vill. 'Morning.

128
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,909
What's with that outfit? You're crazy!

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,100
How can you dress so embarrassingly?

130
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,420
Have you no sense of shame?

131
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,990
I do not.

132
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,170
Don't be so blunt!
Normally you'd be awkward about it!

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,410
As for today's tasks--

134
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,560
I don't care.

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,150
Tell the men I'm faking illness.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,730
Saying it's a fake illness
might be problematic,

137
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,220
but are you sure about that?

138
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,750
Today,

139
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,470
we have the important task of

140
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,370
selecting a mount for Lady Komari.

141
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,690
Eh?! A mount? That mount?

142
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,140
Well, well, well, Lady Gandesblood.

143
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,810
These are the stables of the cavalry.

144
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,270
Wow.

145
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,200
So many mounts!

146
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,190
I can't believe there is this many!

147
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,460
To be honest,

148
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,030
I've always been fascinated by cavaliers.

149
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,540
Oh?

150
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,190
Come here.

151
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,470
Ah, no! Lady Gandesblood!

152
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,860
-That one's...
-Oh!

153
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,390
There, there.

154
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,600
Excuse me.

155
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,010
What is that dragon?

156
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,310
It's a Jiaolong
from the Immortal Havens.

157
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,990
Of all the beasts we have,
it's the finest of the finest...

158
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,390
But it just...

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,320
has a bizarre taste for young girls.

160
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,450
It only opens its heart to young girls.

161
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,490
I see.

162
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,930
That's a very reasonable explanation.

163
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,170
Okay, I've decided.

164
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,020
I'll make this one my partner.

165
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,210
Let's go, Boukephalos.

166
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,390
Let's become the wind together.

167
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,220
Uh-oh.

168
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,020
Yo!

169
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,580
Even if it's a mock battle,
annihilate them all! YEAH!

170
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,990
Terakomari Gandesblood.

171
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,580
I'll get my revenge. I swear.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,180
Move, move, out of the way!

173
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,590
Stop!

174
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,510
Huh?

175
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,820
I'm flying?

176
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,810
Oh, dear, Lady Komari.

177
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,620
I always tell you not to
jump off so dramatically,

178
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,710
but you never listen...

179
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,940
Vill.

180
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,950
I'm not thanking you.

181
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,380
You seem to be stumbling on your words.

182
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,130
Sh...shut up.

183
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,040
Put me down now.

184
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,080
Don't be so hasty, just a bit longer.

185
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,580
She really controlled
the beast at that speed!

186
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,270
-If you fall off, you're dead!
-Amazing.

187
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,420
Her courage is unmatched.

188
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,530
Just put me down already.

189
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,690
Yes, Madam.

190
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,900
Would you look at that!

191
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,570
It's Her Excellency.

192
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,070
You seem to be in good spirits.

193
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,690
Chaostel.

194
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,320
How are you doing?

195
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,740
Thanks to you, I'm doing quite well.

196
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,770
Today, the Komari Corps is diligently

197
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,730
training as always.

198
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,830
Is that so?
That's good to hear.

199
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,780
Yes.

200
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,750
We would love to
have you join us, Your Excellency.

201
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,610
What are you saying?

202
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,550
If I joined, you'd all
be dead in five seconds.

203
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,760
Indeed, that fool over there

204
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,730
looks like he died before
even challenging.

205
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,680
Huh?

206
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,610
That piece of garbage

207
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,810
was hit and killed
by Lady Komari's mount.

208
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,320
-Long live the Commander
-Death to traitors!

209
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,440
-Purge the traitors!
-Hooray!

210
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,810
I ain't dead yet, you idiots!

211
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,520
Die, you little harlot!

212
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,610
Now, di...

213
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,150
You dodged it?

214
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,080
Huh?

215
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,170
What the-

216
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,380
Wow, what agility!

217
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,220
-As expected of her!
-Just like a matador!

218
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm feeling dizzy.

219
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,470
Damn it.

220
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,440
-Get out of the way!
-What?

221
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,270
My eyes! My eyes!

222
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,740
S-sorry...

223
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,840
Lady Komari.

224
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,600
Deliver the last blow now.

225
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,730
Hmph!

226
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,500
This is what happens when you defy me.

227
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,190
Next time, not just the eyeballs,

228
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,220
I'll gouge out your jewels as well.

229
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,420
Be prepared.

230
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,300
You!

231
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,560
You really did it this time.

232
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,320
I won't let you get away with this.

233
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,190
Terakomari Gandesblood.

234
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,720
I challenge you

235
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,420
to a duel!

236
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,180
A duel?

237
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,390
Komarin! Komarin!

238
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,380
Komarin!

239
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,590
Your excellency! Beat
the hell out of this Johan guy!

240
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,090
Ahh, Koma-tan, you're so cute.

241
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,870
Lady Komari, can you hear me?

242
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,760
How are you doing?

243
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,030
Terribly, obviously.

244
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,290
Hang in there.

245
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,230
This is the time to push through.

246
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,070
Hey, Vill.

247
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,110
Will I

248
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,710
come back alive?

249
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,130
Have you forgotten?

250
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,580
Just because you're killed

251
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,920
doesn't mean you'll die.

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,370
I know that.

253
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,190
But it'll hurt,
right? It'll be hot, right?

254
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,430
Don't worry.

255
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,820
As long as I'm here,

256
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,180
there's not a chance in a million

257
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,610
that Lady Komari would die in a duel.

258
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,120
Leave everything to me.

259
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,380
I will definitely bring

260
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,140
the glory of victory to Lady Komari.

261
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,460
Really?

262
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,190
-Wow.
-Woah.

263
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,590
Te-Te-Terakomari.

264
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,960
Today's the day...

265
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,540
y-you'll...

266
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,870
b-burn...

267
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,590
I poisoned his food.

268
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,990
You did this?

269
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,030
What's wrong, Madam?

270
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,830
Burn, burn, burn away.

271
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,530
I'll send you straight to the hospital.

272
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,890
You're the one who needs to
go to the hospital.

273
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,370
What was that!?

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,120
I'll kill you.

275
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,030
What are we going to do with this?

276
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,030
It's just like one of
those scary movies you can't show kids.

277
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,440
-Vil.
-Now, Lady. Komari.

278
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,880
-Use magic.
-What?

279
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,820
I could do that,
I wouldn't be struggling right now.

280
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,480
No, just pretend to use it.

281
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,140
When I give the signal,
snap your fingers

282
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,150
for everyone to see it.

283
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,910
What?

284
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,960
Ready?

285
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,600
Three.

286
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,330
Two.

287
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,670
One.

288
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,540
Now!

289
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,620
What was that magic?

290
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,190
From that position,
she made a hole under the enemy's feet.

291
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,990
That's the advanced magic,
 'Kingdom Collapse'.

292
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,920
Though I didn't feel
any trace of magical flow...

293
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,230
In other words, her Excellency.

294
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,970
can also use magic to hide magical energy.

295
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,800
That's right.

296
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,090
Advanced magic,

297
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,190
'Evanesce Cloak.'

298
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,860
What just happened?

299
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,220
I dug a pit last night.

300
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,840
Is that okay?!

301
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,680
By the way, in this arena,

302
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,570
I set up 52 pitfall traps.

303
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,750
Lady Komari, you must

304
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,720
absolutely not move, okay?

305
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,930
That was magic?

306
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,310
You've got to be kidding!

307
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,560
You crook!

308
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,730
Hey, Vill, where's the pitfall?

309
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,340
Unfortunately,

310
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,070
there are no pitfalls on the straight line

311
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,230
between Lieutenant Helders
and Lady Komari.

312
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,700
Why not?
You dug a lot, didn't you?

313
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,980
Suppose it's just bad luck.

314
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,400
-Burn!
-Time out! Time out!

315
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,420
Hey Vill, can't you do
something with that finger snap again?

316
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,030
No, it's too late.

317
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,340
Too late for what?

318
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,250
You're saying my life is over? Don't--

319
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,770
Landmines.

320
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,080
Huh?

321
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,450
Landmines?

322
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,010
I placed about 69 of them last night.

323
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,620
That's beyond being prepared!

324
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,920
Now the Lieutenant
is safe and soundly dead.

325
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,270
Lady Komari wins.

326
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,810
No, well, maybe.

327
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,820
How dare you?

328
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,010
I am going to get you.

329
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll burn your clothes.

330
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,410
I'll have you do a naked fire dance.

331
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,250
Huh? Did he die?

332
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,120
Lady Komari, declare your victory.

333
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,670
Oh, yes.

334
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,550
Sorry.

335
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,090
The rebel was defeated.

336
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,890
Oh! Oh yeah!

337
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,839
Komarin! Komarin!

338
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,450
Hey, Vill.

339
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,950
I feel like I'm fooling everyone.

340
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,829
It's not that you feel like it.

341
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,869
You are actually deceiving them.

342
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,819
I thought I was gonna die.

343
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,490
I guess I should thank her too.

344
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I'd prefer if you could
express it physically, not just with words.

345
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,610
Can I hug you right away?

346
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,120
-Stop it!
-Come on, Lady Komari.

347
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,440
-You perverted maid!
-Prepare yourself to bathe with me.

348
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,250
Don't touch me there!

349
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,500
You!

350
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,270
You're hurt.

351
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,030
They're just blisters.

352
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,450
By tomorrow,

353
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,250
magic will bring them back to normal.

354
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,240
Tell me how you got hurt.

355
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,990
I can't tell you.

356
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,250
I order you to tell me.

357
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,960
Those pitfalls to kill Johan Herders?

358
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,170
Yes.

359
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,890
I dug them all with a shovel.

360
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,170
You did it by hand?

361
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,980
The only magic I can use is for poison.

362
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,510
Oh, I see.

363
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,070
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,400
I embarrassed myself.

365
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,860
Not at all!

366
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,400
You worked hard for my sake.

367
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,380
If it weren't for you,

368
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,280
I think I'd be dead by now.

369
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,070
I owe you...

370
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,190
my gratitude.

371
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,840
So,

372
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,840
don't try to hide

373
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,280
the wounds you got for me.

374
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,310
I mean,

375
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,770
I feel like I should
share those wounds with you.

376
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,840
So,

377
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,570
what I want to say is

378
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,260
thank you.

379
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,630
That's what I'm saying.

380
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,500
Got it?

381
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,350
I understand.

382
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,980
Huh? You did?

383
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,690
I realized that Lady Komari loves me.

384
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,820
Well, it's fine.

385
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,280
Though

386
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,570
why are you so obsessed with me?

387
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,880
It's a little creepy.

388
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,290
Because you're a one-in-a-million beauty.

389
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,120
I know that.

390
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,880
That's not what I meant.

391
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,040
I feel like there's a more special reason.

392
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm curious.

393
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,410
I have...

394
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,460
commited a sin.

395
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,860
I know that too.

396
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,010
You've sexually harassed me plenty.

397
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,490
Damn it.

398
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,610
Damn Terakomari Gandesblood.

399
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,440
You hate her that much?

400
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,750
Huh?

401
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,870
That young girl.

402
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,350
You are

403
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,640
Lieutenant Johan Herders
of the Imperial Army, aren't you?

404
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,010
Who the hell are you?

405
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,550
I am Millicent.

406
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,140
A disciple of the noble 'Inverted Moon'.

407
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,590
Hey.

408
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,440
Would you like to

409
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,940
make a deal with me?

410
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,410
A party invitation from the
perverted Emperess?

411
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,920
Something like,

412
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,710
'In honor of Lady Komari's success'.

413
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,130
Shouldn't that be overtime pay

414
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,150
or compensatory holidays or something.

415
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,000
Your Excellency.

416
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,190
What does one

417
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,920
normally do at a party?

418
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,070
Are you also-- no,

419
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,300
are you bad with places like this?

420
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,450
Honestly, I am.

421
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,750
I've lived a life

422
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,550
unrelated to the upper class.

423
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,380
You don't have to be so humble

424
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,540
All the war achievements you've made

425
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,930
as a member of the Imperial Army
serves to prove your efforts.

426
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,970
You should be proud, Belius.

427
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,080
Your Excellency.

428
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,700
Oh, it's the beautiful Komari!

429
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,240
Are you having fun?

430
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,040
Easy, easy.

431
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,730
Today is a day without formalities.

432
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,170
Komari.

433
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,140
You can call me "Ren" if you'd like.

434
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,810
By the way, Komari.

435
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,710
How's the work of the Crimson Skies?

436
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,450
That's hard to say...

437
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,600
I guess I shouldn't ask.

438
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,590
In just a short time
after taking the position,

439
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,720
you defeated the four other nations
apart from Divine Paradise.

440
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,130
I've never seen a Commander like you.

441
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,200
No matter how I see it, I was just lucky.

442
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,660
Today's party is
in honor of your accomplishments.

443
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,770
Come on.

444
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,270
How about a 100% blood juice?

445
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,340
Oh.

446
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,040
That's right, you don't like blood.

447
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,280
Actually.

448
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,990
I am relieved.

449
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,960
You had been a shut-in
for the past three years

450
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,710
I thought you'd struggle
with rejoining society.

451
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,610
But it seems
your father's gamble paid off.

452
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,870
Gamble?

453
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,280
Yes.

454
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,820
The bet of forcibly
making you a Commander,

455
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,840
to bring you outside.

456
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,720
Eh?

457
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,630
Komari.

458
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,170
You are no longer alone.

459
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,940
With trusted subordinates

460
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,630
and Komarists throughout the empire,

461
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,730
a lot of people, like me, adore you.

462
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,390
So, don't ever let a mistake
bring you down

463
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,140
like it did three years ago.

464
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,680
Now, enjoy the party, okay!

465
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,610
Terakomari.

466
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,770
Could you

467
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,650
chat with me too?

468
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,990
