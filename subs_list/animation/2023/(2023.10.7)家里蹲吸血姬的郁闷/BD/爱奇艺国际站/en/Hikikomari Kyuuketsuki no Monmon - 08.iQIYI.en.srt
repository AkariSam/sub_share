1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,510
What is this?

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,050
Where are we?

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,720
This is the night sky where
my memories are scattered.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,350
Sakuna?

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,980
Each one of these stars
is a memory of mine.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,900
A planetarium of memories, so to speak.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,770
Wow, it's beautiful.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,110
No...

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,110
It's not beautiful at all.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,320
Please look.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,910
That's the beginning memory.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,090
She's my older sister.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,380
Komari Memoir.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,420
She was truly a kind person.

15
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,280
Those were peaceful days.

16
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,780
My family was really close.

17
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,790
On days off

18
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,920
we would all go star gazing.

19
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,000
I think that's why I liked stars so much.

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,970
However, looking back

21
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,220
those days may all have been just a dream.

22
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,850
Ms. Terakomari...

23
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,980
did you know in the world
there exists a "God-Killing Evil?"

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,480
What is that?

25
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,730
"God" is a reference to the Magic Core.

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,400
In modern times

27
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,950
the Magic Core is treated like a God.

28
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,200
The ones who want to kill the cores...

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,410
In other words, The Inverted Moons.

30
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,370
The Inverted Moons?

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,500
They will do

32
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,710
whatever it takes to
destroy the Magic Core.

33
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,270
They don't hesitate for a moment even when

34
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,570
slaughtering a peaceful family.

35
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,530
B-But...

36
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,240
They can be resurrected
with the Magic Core, right?

37
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,740
They can't.

38
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,450
My family...

39
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,990
was cut to pieces by a sacred tool

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,500
which nullifies the power
of the Magic Core.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,460
Why would they do that?

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,790
There was a single motive.

43
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,670
Their aim was to drive me to despair

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,459
and use me as a pawn.

45
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,220
It seems I was valuable to them.

46
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,430
Valuable?

47
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,970
My Rekkaku Liberation.

48
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Asterism Rotation

49
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,940
It manipulates the memories
of the person you kill.

50
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,900
It was the man who killed
my family that told me...

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,070
If you work hard as a member

52
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,150
of the Inverted Moons

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,370
I'll show you how to get your family back.

54
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,120
And that is how

55
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,710
I was forced to become a terrorist.

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,330
The mission I was given was simple.

57
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,470
Then, by manipulating
their memories, I was

58
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,430
to extract information
about the Magic Core.

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,270
That was it.

60
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,980
The person who killed my father

61
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,860
was you, Sakuna?

62
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,650
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,650
If I failed my mission

64
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,440
they said my family...

65
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,240
They said my precious family
would be gone forever.

66
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,780
Over and over again...

67
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,950
Every time I was going to quit
they'd say my family would die.

68
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,909
Over and over...

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,710
Ms. Terakomari...

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,880
I will kill you.

71
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
I don't know where the Magic Core is.

72
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,800
It'll be meaningless to kill me.

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,890
Come...

74
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,010
Let's kill each other.

75
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,320
I really don't want to.

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,950
I know compared to you I am nothing.

77
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,450
But I still have to fight on.

78
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,620
If I don't I'll lose my
family all over again.

79
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,290
Wait, I don't understand.

80
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,210
Your family is already gone, aren't they?

81
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,130
They're still right here.

82
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,090
You will become my sister

83
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,090
Ms. Terakomari.

84
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,800
Your sister?

85
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,970
That's how I've made my new family.

86
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,350
I'd find people with
a beautiful constellation to them

87
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,480
and rebuild their memory.

88
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,940
For example, my father...

89
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,400
Herdeus Heaven doesn't
look like my father at all

90
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,740
but he was born under the
beautiful Aquila constellation.

91
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,370
So without a doubt he is now my father.

92
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,870
I will adjust your memory too

93
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,870
Ms. Terakomari.

94
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,500
Please hold still.

95
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,920
I'll try to make sure it doesn't hurt.

96
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,010
I'll do it for you.

97
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,270
I'll be your older sister!

98
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,180
You will?

99
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,440
But, I don't want to be killed.

100
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,610
Listen up!

101
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,150
You only have one older
sister in this world!

102
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,320
But you changing people's memories

103
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,820
and trying to replace your sister

104
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,280
is disgracing the name of your sister!

105
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,909
I-I know...

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,909
I know I'm strange.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,750
Right, you are seriously strange.

108
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,630
But even though I know all
that it's just been so hard.

109
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,720
That's why I became so strange.

110
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,350
Thank you.

111
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,060
My real sister

112
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,400
would hold me like this too.

113
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,860
Really? She was really a kind sister then.

114
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,570
You're kind Ms. Terakomari.

115
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,780
I'm not kind.

116
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,450
I'm just weak.

117
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,530
You really are kind.

118
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,250
Ms. Terakomari...

119
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,750
Can I call you big sister?

120
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,750
Sure, indulge as much as you wish!

121
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,800
Big sister!

122
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,390
What are you doing Sakuna Memoir?

123
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,600
Odilon?

124
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,350
I called you didn't I?

125
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,230
I told you to kill Gandesblood.

126
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,980
-I know.
-You know?

127
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,940
You say you know?

128
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,900
Sakuna!

129
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,940
Then why is Gandesblood unharmed?

130
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,160
Why were you sitting and playing
with that spoiled brat?

131
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,530
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

132
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,370
How pathetic! Stop apologizing!

133
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,580
Are you listening Sakuna Memoir?

134
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,250
Hurry and stand up!

135
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,170
Stand up and kill that brat!

136
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,790
Stop it!

137
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,590
So it's you...

138
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,010
You're the one who pushed
Sakuna into the depths of hell!

139
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,720
Hmph!
Sakuna Memoir...

140
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,850
Wake up now and kill that little brat!

141
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,850
I told you to stop!

142
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,480
How sad.

143
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,610
There is nothing more unbearable to watch
than the resistance of the powerless.

144
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,650
S-Stop it!

145
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,870
L-Let me go!

146
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,040
You're too fragile Terakomari Gandesblood!

147
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,960
If you're this fragile

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,670
I don't even need Sakuna Memoir's powers.

149
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,590
Alright, I'll just torture you.

150
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,600
Get away from Ms. Terakomari!

151
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,930
Don't you do bad things to Ms. Terakomari!

152
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,900
What do you think you're
saying Sakuna Memoir?

153
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,230
I'm not going to do what you say anymore!

154
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,070
I'm leaving the Inverted Moons!

155
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,280
Don't be ridiculous!

156
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,610
You'll be my tool
for the rest of your life!

157
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,490
You're the ridiculous one!

158
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm never listening to you again!

159
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
You can't be serious!

160
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,870
The gift you sent me

161
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,660
"Cornelius' Secret Elixir."

162
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,470
Even if I die here

163
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,060
I will definitely take you down!

164
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,810
"Dust Tail's Comet!"

165
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,900
So arrogant for a simple tool!

166
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,740
You're the one, it was you!

167
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,330
Looks like you're starting to feel
the side effects of your drug!

168
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,970
Ms. Tera... Komari...

169
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,390
I'm sorry you had to go through
all this because of me.

171
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,230
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,350
It's all over now.

173
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,320
If all else fails have
Terakomari drink your blood.

174
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,990
Then she'll save you even if it kills her.

175
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,220
You're finally awake Gandesblood.

176
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,680
Until you cough up the
location of the Magic Core

177
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,890
I'll cut you to pieces with my
sacred tool, the "Taiho Sword!"

178
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,280
Ms. Terakomari...

179
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,650
I need more... blood.

180
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,320
No, stop.

181
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,750
You mongrel.

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,460
Looks like you had one hell
of an ace up your sleeve.

183
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,900
Until you apologize

184
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,610
I won't forgive you.

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,090
What is that?

186
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,760
Komari is white...

187
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,680
Depending on the race
of the blood she drinks

188
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,800
the quality of "The Mercy of
the Lonely Crimson" changes.

189
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,600
That means her Rekkaku Liberation

190
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,350
is the power than can truly
level the six nations.

191
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,190
Do you intend to force my daughter Komari

192
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,980
to do what Yulin could not accomplish?

193
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,410
In any case,

194
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,160
we finally got the identity of
the mastermind behind all this.

195
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,580
Come on, show us again, Komari.

196
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,380
You could be the one to
turn the world upside down.

197
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,890
This is ludicrous!

198
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,850
Cornelius' Secret Elixir was
refined by a sacred tool!

199
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,060
You cannot nullify it's effects...

200
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,270
It can't be!

201
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,400
Could this be magic independent
of the Magic Core?

202
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,990
Apologize to Sakuna.

203
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,450
Huh?

204
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,660
Apologize to Sakuna.

205
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,740
Why would I have to apologize to my tool?

206
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,290
This pathetic brat pledged her
allegiance to the Inverted Moon!

207
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,000
She is a loyal servant!

208
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,210
What's wrong with her owner
user her up as he pleases?

209
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,140
Where did you go, Terakomari Gandesblood?

210
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,020
Right here.

211
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,320
You pathetic little brat!

212
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,910
How can this be?

213
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,340
Damn it!

214
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm gonna kill you one day, I swear.

215
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,930
Terakomari Gandesblood!

216
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,510
Rekkaku Liberation...

217
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,470
Asterism Rotation...

218
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,060
Lord Metal...

219
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,230
Treat him quickly!

220
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,900
No, if we go to Mulnite,
we can use the Magic Core--

221
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,940
You fool!

222
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,990
Relying on the Magic Core makes you
unworthy of the Inverted Moon!

223
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,240
Amatsu, our plan failed.

224
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,870
All thanks to Terakomari Gandesblood!

225
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,870
I know...

226
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,250
The video was being
broadcast all over Mulnite.

227
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,050
Then that makes things easy.

228
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,090
We have to come up with a
plan to kill her right away!

229
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,090
Next time we'll destroy the
Magic Core without fail!

230
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,550
To accomplish this...

231
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,970
Lord Odilon...

232
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,180
What do you want?

233
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,140
I am not your tool.

234
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,859
-I am not your tool.
-I am not your tool.

235
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,569
-I am not your tool.
-I am not your tool.

236
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,910
-I am not your tool.
-I am not your tool.

237
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,160
Sakuna Memoir!

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,260
It serves you right.

239
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,010
They really got you, Odilon.

240
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,060
Sakuna Memoir regularly
returned to the hideout

241
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,770
killing your men one by one
and brainwashing them.

242
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,360
If you knew that why didn't you tell me?

243
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Damn it!

244
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,150
Not only did the mission fail
but all my tools are gone.

245
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,700
After failing so completely

246
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,700
I'll never get another chance!

247
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,330
Damn it! Damn it to hell!

248
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,080
It's all her fault! If
it weren't for her...

249
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,500
It's you!

250
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,380
Apologize.

251
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,760
Apologize to Sakuna.

252
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,180
I'll never apologize!

253
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,930
A foolish little girl like that
deserves to be used until she di--

254
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,770
Screw you.

255
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,780
The winner of The Clash of The Seven is

256
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,280
Terakomari Gandesblood!

257
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,450
Lady Komari, say ah!

258
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,160
It's okay, I can eat on my own.

259
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,830
I won't have it.

260
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,250
As a maid I'm obligated
to take care of my Lord.

261
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,300
You were wounded too though.

262
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,630
I can't be taken care by
someone who's injured.

263
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,380
Then make me say "aah."

264
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,010
Mouth to mouth is fine too.

265
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,760
You eat on your own and I will too!

266
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,980
Excuse me.

267
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,900
Sakuna! Are you feeling okay?

268
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,940
Yes, thanks to you.

269
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,190
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,150
I've caused so much trouble for you.

271
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,950
I won't talk about making
you my sister anymore.

272
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm really so sorry.

273
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,960
Okay, I wasn't actually bothered by it.

274
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,960
Hey, why are you crying?

275
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,510
Everyone is saying that.

276
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,300
I forgive ya.

277
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,770
Going forward I hope you will
work hard as one of The Seven.

278
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm sorry for killing you all.

279
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,860
Don't worry about it.

280
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,700
We all learned how strong
you are, that's enough.

281
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,620
My Rekkaku Liberation didn't work on you?

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,790
I thought I'd die when you killed me.

283
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,670
But I am a Commander, you know.

284
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,710
Such an inaccurate Rekkaku Liberation

285
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,050
can't control my soul.

286
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,260
Wait a second.

287
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,050
Then why didn't you turn me in?

288
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,800
You knew I was a member of
The Inverted Moons.

289
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,100
Why didn't you punish me?

290
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,350
It may not have been right
of me to overlook it.

291
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,560
Perhaps I should have
quickly killed Odilon Metal

292
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,940
and save you from them.

293
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,070
But it wasn't right to do.

294
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,530
Because from the beginning,
you intended to take revenge

295
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,620
on the Inverted Moon with your own hands.

296
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,040
God resides

297
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,210
in the heart that struggles
in the face of adversity.

298
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,040
That's why I thought at the very least

299
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,920
as your father I'd offer
some emotional support.

300
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,380
Why?

301
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,630
Why can you still smile?

302
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,890
I killed you...

303
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,640
It's too strange.

304
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,470
I guess so.

305
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,890
Growing up,
I was always told I was strange.

306
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,650
I thought I'd keep this a secret

307
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,990
but I was best friends with your father.

308
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,320
He was the only one who treated

309
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,030
an oddball like myself
with respect like equals.

310
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,870
I'm glad,

311
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,080
it seems you've also found a good friend.

312
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,130
Everyone is really so kind.

313
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,550
But...

314
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,090
I still feel like it isn't right.

315
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,760
Ms. Terakomari, would you
please give me my punishment?

316
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,600
I've got it!

317
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,270
Why don't you go out with me?

318
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,730
Wha...

319
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,190
What do you mean by the Ms. Komari?

320
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,320
Oh, sorry I didn't mean "go out with me."

321
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,080
As a reward for winning
the Clash of the Seven

322
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,120
I am about to go on a
two week long vacation.

323
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,710
Of course I plan on
spending it shut inside.

324
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,290
But every now and then
I'll want to hang out with someone.

325
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,510
So if I call you, then please come.

326
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,590
That's not a punishment at all.

327
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,260
Alright, then how about giving
me advice on my novel writing?

328
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,510
I still want to try a lot of topics.

329
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,480
It'll be pretty tedious,
if I do say so myself!

330
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,980
Prepare yourself!

331
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440
Okay!

332
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,440
I'll come as soon
as you call me, Ms. Terakomari!

333
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,860
You don't have to be so formal.

334
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,410
You and I are, um...

335
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,120
Friends...

336
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,000
So, what should I call you?

337
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,540
Call me Komari!

338
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,460
Thank you! Ms. Komari!

339
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,980
The Mercy of the Lonely Crimson
is no normal Rekkaku Liberation.

340
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,150
It's just as you say Lord Cornelius.

341
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,490
To underestimate Terakomari Gandesblood

342
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,450
would surely lead to folly.

343
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,070
However, it is not a problem.

344
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,120
I have you all here with me.

345
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,330
You have the full support
of The Inverted Moon.

346
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,790
Up to a point that is.

347
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,130
I know...

348
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,840
Until Guerra-Arca destroys
all the other Magic Cores

349
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,760
let's all get along why don't we?
