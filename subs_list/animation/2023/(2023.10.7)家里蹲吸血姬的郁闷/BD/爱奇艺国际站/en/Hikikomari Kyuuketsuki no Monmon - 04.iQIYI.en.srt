1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,000
Good, you came!

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,360
Terakomari.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,560
Vill!

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,750
Oh my, no need to get upset.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,940
She isn't dead yet.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,250
I will kill her eventually though.

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,530
Give me back Vill!

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,220
Come now, there's no need to rush.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,970
We finally have
this chance to talk in private.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,920
So, Terakomari.

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,340
Do you have any idea
how much pain I've been through

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,780
since that day?

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,560
That day? When was that?

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,810
Three years ago today.

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm talking about the day
I tried to take that pendant of yours.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,820
You must become strong.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,850
Stronger than anyone else.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,850
#4 CRIMSON RESENTMENT
Yes, father.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,380
My father's teachings were simple.

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,980
The Bluenights are
a family of politicians.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,200
In a vampire society
where force reigns supreme,

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,000
the fact is that weak
politicians are picked on and eaten.

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,539
The person over there who has come
all the way from Divine Paradise,

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,650
is Mr. Amatsu.

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,650
Starting today,
he will give you lessons in fighting.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,430
Do not bring us shame.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,530
My name is Kakumei Amatsu.

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,610
Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,539
N-Nice to meet--

30
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,520
Ah!

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,789
Your father hopes that
you have special powers within you.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,140
Special... powers?

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,470
It's a supernatural ability
called "Rekkaku Liberation."

34
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,630
Rekkaku Liberation.

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,410
A special ability that deviates
from all the laws of this world.

36
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,270
It is said that

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,860
once used,

38
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,590
it has the power to pierce
the Earth and move stars.

39
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,920
The likelihood that a person has
this ability innately is extremely low.

40
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,770
However, our research has revealed
that if you undergo special training,

41
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,480
you can acquire this power.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,350
What is the special training?

43
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,730
Cultivating a spirit of resilience
in the face of adversity

44
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,100
It seems that the state of one's mind is
deeply related to the Rekkaku Liberation.

45
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,720
And the quickest way to train your mind

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,570
is to threaten your life!

47
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,120
This is called a Sacred Article.

48
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,190
It is an item that can cause damage
which cannot be healed by Magic Cores.

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,090
By enduring
the pain of a wound that won't heal,

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,460
the mind can be trained.

51
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,810
Please train me, Mr. Amatsu.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,300
It's already been one month
since Mr. Amatsu arrived!

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,180
Why can't you use
the Rekkaku Liberation yet!?

54
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,900
The Gandesbloods will be laughing at us!

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,600
With such a mess of an heir!

56
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,920
Damn it!

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,930
You are a complete failure compared to
the daughter of the Gandesbloods!

58
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,700
F-Father...

59
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,370
Hey, you hear about the kid
in the class next door?

60
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,050
They say she can use magic
that others can't!

61
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,780
Are you talking about advanced magic?

62
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,440
That is cool, but...

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,540
No, no. Not that, it was retsu...

64
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,660
Rekkaku?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,260
Rekkaku Liberation!?

66
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,560
Oh yeah, that's it!

67
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,560
Can you tell me everything
you heard about her?

68
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,330
Whatever, hurry up and show me.

69
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,270
Please drink my blood.

70
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,710
Huh?

71
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,700
My Rekkaku Liberation allows me to see
the future of those who drink my blood.

72
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,210
Pandora Poison.

73
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,560
If it's about what's going to happen today,
my accuracy rate is 100%.

74
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,200
Oh?

75
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,460
I see your future.

76
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,590
What can you see?

77
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,220
This is...

78
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,790
Umm.

79
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,920
What is it?
Stop holding back and tell me!

80
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,900
Okay.

81
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,230
You are a pitiful person.

82
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,570
Huh!?

83
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,730
This one is no good, she's broken.

84
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,440
-It's no fun if she doesn't react.
-Should we kill her then?

85
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,070
Shall I blow your head off!?

86
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,540
Stop...

87
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,870
Stop it!

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,920
Ms. Gandesblood!

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,830
This is, umm...

90
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,270
Gandesblood!?

91
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,490
This brat

92
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,340
is the daughter of the Gandesbloods!?

93
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,750
We've come this far and now I'm sure.

94
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,060
It seems you do not have the
ability to evoke the Rekkaku Liberation.

95
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,690
That's not to say you don't show promise.

96
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,840
You have other talents
that anyone would be envious of.

97
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,490
What should I do then?

98
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,660
Act freely, my dear.

99
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,040
Admire the things you love
and kill the things you hate.

100
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,420
Is there someone you'd like to kill?

101
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,760
In that case,
do whatever it takes to kill them.

102
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,720
Come on, if you want this to stop
use your Rekkaku Liberation or something!

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,280
Let's see you put up a fight!

104
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,320
I pity you.

105
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,270
Huh, what was that?
I didn't hear you.

106
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,200
I pity you.

107
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,450
Is there something troubling you?

108
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,909
In order to force
Terakomari's spirit to submit to me,

109
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,700
I thoroughly investigated
her lineage and history.

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,500
I learned that the pendant was
a keepsake of Terakomari's mother.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,670
Hey, you mind if I borrow

112
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,500
that pendant?

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,260
After that I can't seem
to remember what happened.

114
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,880
Afterwards I learned that

115
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,960
I died after Terakomari evoked
her Rekkaku Liberation.

116
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,660
My life changed forever that day.

117
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,400
Your goddamn father

118
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,580
falsely accused my family
of treason and deported them.

119
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,409
Kicked out of the academy,
kicked out of the country,

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,960
my family was separated
and we had nowhere to go.

121
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,000
I finally ended up

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,800
part of the terrorist organization,
The Inverted Moons.

123
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,970
While you were enjoying
the elegant life of a shut-in,

124
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,900
I was experiencing my fill of malice
that the world has to offer.

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,230
There has been an unchanging conviction
in my heart for the past three years.

126
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,170
I will exact my revenge.

127
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,580
A conviction to kill you.

128
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,700
That is all.

129
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,860
Oh, so she is actually similar to me.

130
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,520
Someone who is lost,
cannot live in the moment

131
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,540
and can't escape from the trauma
of what happened three years ago.

132
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,130
What are you doing Terakomari!?

133
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,120
You! Why are you here?

134
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,810
It doesn't matter!

135
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,030
You need to run away!
She's crazy and she has a Sacred Article!

136
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,299
Just look at this wound on my stomach,

137
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,530
it hurts and it isn't healing.

138
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,270
I see.

139
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,870
I'm sorry I'm late.

140
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,950
I'm going to help, you stay right there.

141
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,470
Don't... don't be stupid.

142
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,180
I was helping her
so that we could kill you.

143
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,200
Despite that y--

144
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,330
Eh!?

145
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,950
Shut up you noisy gnat.

146
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,820
I'm about to fight
Terakomari to the death.

147
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,420
I'm sorry. If you die now
then you'll be safe by the time you revive.

148
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,160
A Magic Stone?

149
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,460
Well done, Terakomari.

150
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,670
I see you've actually
come prepared to fight.

151
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,150
Come now, how long will you be
hiding like a rat!? Come out and play!

152
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,080
You precious little
maid is going to get killed!

153
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,370
Okay, next is--

154
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,470
What are you doing?

155
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,400
It's no fun
if you die so quickly you know.

156
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,960
Vill!

157
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,610
Hmm? You can still stand?

158
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,280
Well done.

159
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,030
I won't lose!

160
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,230
You have more guts than I thought.

161
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,430
Where would you like to be shot next?

162
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,640
Your chest? Your stomach?

163
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,530
Or right in the face?

164
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,820
It'll be fun to ruin a beauty that comes
around only once in ten billion years.

165
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,990
You're wrong.

166
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,580
Huh?

167
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,600
It's not ten billion years.
It's a hundred million.

168
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,190
Your attempt at humility disgusts me.

169
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,730
I'm ten billion times
more disgusted with you!

170
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,310
Oho? A special attack!?
I think you've lost your mind!

171
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,030
Explode! Magic Stones!

172
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,150
What a petty attempt.

173
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,360
Shock Wave!

174
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,450
Get crushed! Millicent!

175
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,440
I did it.

176
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,240
Vill, are you okay!?

177
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,200
Vill!

178
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,700
You've done such a good job,

179
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,210
Terakomari!

180
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,640
Oh, little miss Terakomari
where do you think you're going!?

181
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,360
If you think you can kill me

182
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,610
with such a low-grade magic stone,
you're sadly mistaken.

183
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,160
Does it hurt? It hurts a lot doesn't it?

184
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,350
Just look at all the blood you're losing.

185
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,330
S-Stop...

186
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm not stopping you idiot!

187
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,200
You're three years too late to kill me.

188
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,160
Weaklings like you

189
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,600
are meant to be killed
like the insects you are

190
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,620
like you never existed in the first place.

191
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,690
Crying? I knew it,
you're a real worthless piece of trash.

192
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,860
You think crying will save you?

193
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,630
I'm telling you,
the world is not that easy.

194
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,760
Even if you cry
nobody is coming to save you.

195
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,300
You'll only ever be
able to rely on yourself.

196
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,260
Shut up! Shut up!

197
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,180
Don't get smart with me!

198
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,060
How about you just use
your Rekkaku Liberation now?

199
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,240
I don't know.

200
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,600
I don't know what you're talking about!

201
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,750
You really do seem to know nothing.

202
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,550
Didn't you come here thinking you could
beat me because of your Rekkaku Liberation?

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,450
I came for Vill--

204
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,360
I came all this way to save Vill.

205
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,640
I've always been short,
no physical talents,

206
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,830
unable to use any magic
and in general a bad vampire.

207
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,370
Coming here was really scary.

208
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,990
My legs were trembling and I thought of
turning back multiple times.

209
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,600
But

210
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,040
I can't stand to run away anymore!

211
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,280
I'm weak, I know that well enough.

212
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,480
But I have to try.

213
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,950
For the people who care about me.

214
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,960
I know I have to do my best!

215
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,210
I can't take this.
I really can't stand this. Alright then,

216
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,220
I'll just kill the maid first.

217
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,600
No, stop!

218
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,460
Watch closely Terakomari!

219
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,520
Your precious maid is
about to reduced to a heap of meat!

220
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,660
I won't let you lay a hand on Vill!

221
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,920
Shut up you vexing brat!

222
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,770
I can- I can still fight.

223
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,950
I said shut up!

224
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,060
There's no way...

225
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,730
There's no way
I'm leaving here without Vill!

226
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,390
Acting all righteous
but you're a simple shut-in!

227
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,460
I'm not a shut-in!

228
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,150
I'm going to defeat you
and turn over a new leaf!

229
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,540
If you think you can do it, then do it!!

230
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,500
So is this how I die?

231
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,780
Without being able to defeat
Millicent or save Vill?

232
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,780
As a helpless little shut-in?

233
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,480
That's, not what I want.

234
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,730
Lady Komari.

235
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,970
You are the strongest
and kindest person in the world.

236
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:28,630
But you lack confidence and always
end up with that anxious look on your face.

237
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,890
V-Vill.

238
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,240
So you're still alive!?

239
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,050
Forgive me Lady Komari.

240
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,350
I'm ready to receive
any punishment for you.

241
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,060
Lady Komari.

242
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,530
You will not lose.

243
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,260
Oh, this is so exciting!

244
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,490
Hurry up and show me, Terakomari.

245
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,190
The supreme Rekkaku Liberation,
unprecedented in the history of the Empire.

246
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,710
The full power of
"The Solitary Crimson Sky."

247
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,940
I'm killing you.

248
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,170
What is that!?

249
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,560
-Is this the Rekkaku Liber--
-I'm killing you.

250
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,830
What happened!?
Her magical power has suddenly grown!

251
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,360
That's right, just like back then.

252
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,630
This brat.

253
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,520
She drank my blood.

254
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,260
-Millicent.
-Eh?

255
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,960
You really are a pitiful person.

256
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,610
Wha?

257
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,110
You shitty little brat!

258
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,580
Your Excellency!

259
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,070
We're sorry Your Excellency!
Even against your orders we want to be of aid!

260
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,970
That's special grade magic,
"Annihilating Flame!"

261
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,430
Please run, Your Excellency!

262
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,440
I will destroy you!

263
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,570
♪ Running through this fate with you ♪

264
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
That was too intense YO!

265
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,710
Whoa!

266
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,470
Y-You!

267
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,650
You... you've gotta be....

268
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,110
You've gotta be kidding!?

269
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,940
It's all over.

270
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,350
That's right.

271
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,200
Just die, Terakomari!

272
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,480
Ah... Oh....

273
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,950
It seems that the state of one's mind is
deeply related to the Rekkaku Liberation.

274
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,650
I know I have to try my best
for the people who care about me!

275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,670
Ah, so that's why.

276
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,720
Prepare yourself.

277
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,550
The one who was weak

278
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,730
was me after all.

279
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,820
If only I had taken a different approach

280
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,360
I would have had a different future.

281
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,330
With this,

282
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,050
I give you peace.

283
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,640
Lady Komari.

284
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,380
Are you awake?

285
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,780
Vill!

286
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,010
Are you okay--

287
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,060
Owowowowow!

288
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
Please stay still.
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

289
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,350
Vill, is this Heaven?

290
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,350
No, this is reality.

291
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,350
You won, Lady Komari.

292
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,160
Huh? What did I win at?

293
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,140
The first time Komari evoked
the Rekkaku Liberation, she was three.

294
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,340
At dinner, she drank blood
for the first time,

295
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,870
and killed all of us who were in the room.

296
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,970
Immediately after that we hypnotized Komari
so that she would hate blood.

297
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,390
I don't want her to have a hard time.

298
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,700
If she doesn't remember the Rekkaku Liberation,
it's best to leave it that way.

299
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,060
Come on, what did I beat?

300
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,790
The past.

301
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,710
The past?

302
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,590
The Mulnite Empire detains
the woman from the “Inverted Moon.”

303
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,390
Someone came to help, I guess.

304
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,030
By the way, what will you do now?

305
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,670
Eh?

306
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,680
Everything from
three years ago is wrapped up.

307
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,930
-There's no need for you to stay my maid--
-No way!

308
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,330
Do you mean to say you're done with me?

309
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,550
No that's not--

310
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,680
I'll have no choice but to become a thief,
break in and steal your panties!

311
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,830
At least steal something valuable!
If you say that again, I'll really fire you!

312
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,630
Alright, alright.

313
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,450
You'll be my maid from now on too.

314
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,460
So always stay by my side okay?

315
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,610
I'm relying on you, Vill.

316
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,740
Huh? Was that a proposal!?

317
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,110
How could you possibly think that!?

318
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,000
#5 SAKUNA MEMOIR AND THE RED CRIMSON SKIES
