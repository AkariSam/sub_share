1
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,220
Full force, frontal assault!

2
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,560
Kill all of these inferior races!

3
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,560
You asked me to surrender.

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,690
I'll go ahead and ask
you the same exact thing.

5
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,700
You have no choice but to bow down

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,370
before a 5,000 man strong Paradise Corps.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,330
How silly.

8
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,410
What?

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,540
An army built on violence and fear is

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,000
a dime a dozen.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,380
No, there's no point in saying it.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,800
Anyway, I came here

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,010
to see your final moments.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,510
What a joke.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,180
Sounds like the howling of a loser to me.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,060
To the people of the
world, good afternoon!

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,350
This is Melka Tiano of
the Six Nations Newspaper!

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,730
This is my first time
attempting something like this

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,940
and I am nervous, but I have
something to share with you!

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,660
What I'm calling
〝The Darkness of Gera-Alka〞

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,280
will be easier to explain by
showing you rather than reporting.

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,660
Please look at all of these holding cells!

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,330
We are underneath
Gera-Alka's Dream Paradise.

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,420
It isn't only supporters of the
Alka royalty who are held here!

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,670
Various races from other countries
are also unjustly held

26
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,930
and subjected to
inhuman experimentation!

27
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,810
Ms. Melka let's go home!
We're going to get ourselves killed!

28
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,470
It doesn't matter if we're killed!

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,600
A soldier must die on the battlefield!

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,560
Can you please remember
you are a journalist, not a warrior?

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,479
This is clearly an act against humanity.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,200
President Madhart, who
oversaw these atrocities,

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,490
is planning to attack Fort Fall
with an army of 5,000!

34
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,290
Can the world continue
to allow evil to rule?

35
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,790
Of course it can't!

36
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,340
So this is Nelia's Rekkaku Liberation?

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,640
Yes!

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
Sword Flower of Extermination!

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,940
My sword will cut down all that is evil!

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,730
Everyone, we've come to save you.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,530
Hurry and go!

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,860
Stand with me to change Alka!

43
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,160
At last, Lady Nelia has taken a stand!

44
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,540
This'll be the end of Madhart!

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,920
No matter what

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,420
I am going to change Alka!

47
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,590
Lady Nelia, there's
no point in doing this.

48
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,420
Why?

49
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,590
Gertrude!

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,770
Lady Nelia...

51
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,730
You are my servant!

52
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,520
It's time I punished the
maid who betrayed her master!

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,730
You're wrong!

54
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,150
This was all done for you Lady Nelia!

55
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,120
Despite being my servant...

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,410
You dare to

57
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,079
BETRAY ME!

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,550
Huh? Oh...

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,730
What did you want me to do?

60
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,810
You cannot defeat Madhart.

61
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,690
That man is a hero in a real bad way.

62
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,070
That's why...

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
I didn't want you to be hurt

64
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,990
anymore than you already have Lady Nelia.

65
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,080
You are Rainsworth's little sister right?

66
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,830
I thought you didn't care about me at all.

67
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,580
You're wrong.

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,550
I have been abused by my brother.

69
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,680
He said if you're not strong,
you're not worthy of living.

70
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,600
But you always cared for me Lady Nelia.

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,140
You always worried
about me when I got hurt.

72
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,650
You even celebrated my birthday with me.

73
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,400
That's why I wanted you
to forget all the hard times

74
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,409
and live your life in peace.

75
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,990
My brother is a scumbag, but at least

76
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,670
he takes care of the
things that are 〝his.〞

77
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,290
I don't need peace that
comes with living as someone's pet.

78
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,340
Thank you for everything up to now.

80
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,140
Please just forget about me.

81
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,390
You were being rebellious.

82
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,100
I don't get all upset
when one of my servants

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,100
bites the hand that feeds.

84
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,440
Just tell me if there's
something upsetting you.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,900
It's not good to keep it bottled up.

86
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,650
Lady Nelia...

87
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,320
Yes maam.

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,660
I'm your best servant after all.

89
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,660
Ms. Komari, Ms. Cunningham...

90
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,700
Carla?

91
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,700
What?

92
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,540
I'm about to go after Rainsworth.

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,420
Our enemy seems to have a force of 5,000.

94
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,710
There's no way for you to win
by yourself, Ms. Cunningham.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,090
I'll fight even if there isn't a chance.

96
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,470
That's my role to play.

97
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,600
If you go on a suicide mission,
you'll just die in vain.

98
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,560
Can we not first think of a strategy?

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,430
But I thought you were

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,980
the Five Sword Emperor
who destroys the universe.

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,610
Um, that's right but

102
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,650
let's plan a strategy
to be on the safe side.

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,440
I don't understand you.

104
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,280
Anyway, you do have a point.

105
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,450
The enemy is too powerful for our forces.

106
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,960
We've exposed their evil, but it'll be
futile if we are defeated by their might.

107
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,340
To counter them,

108
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,710
the people of the world must
all join hands and stand together.

109
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,470
Komari, come here a second.

110
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,680
-What--
-Ms. Nelia!

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,810
We can't fully trust you yet.

112
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,180
Do not approach Ms. Komari!

113
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,230
No need to have your guard up.

114
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,650
Komari and I have already shared blood.

115
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,730
Eh?

116
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,480
It can't be!

117
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,110
You fed Lady Komari your blood?

118
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,490
No, Komari actually fed me her blood.

119
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,409
Oh! It can't be!

120
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,659
Huh?

121
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,920
What are you doing?

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,210
It's to thank you.

123
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,840
I'll feed you my blood.

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,630
Blood?

125
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,010
No, wait! You don't need to do that!

126
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,130
I've received your blood

127
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,930
so if you won't suck
my blood I'll feel sad.

128
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,430
The thought is enough, really.

129
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,680
I'll drink some tomato juice instead.

130
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,060
I won't have it.

131
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,350
Komari.

132
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,570
You have an amazing power
and if you drink my blood, you'll see it.

133
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,610
Even if you say so...

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,740
My teacher was your mother.

135
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,990
That makes us sisters of a sort.

136
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,200
Could you just try to trust what
your big sister is telling you?

137
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,500
But...

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,630
I want to change the world with you.

139
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,790
I feel like now we will be able to.

140
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,720
I cannot forgive those
who cause other's pain.

141
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,640
The world isn't just for Madhart.

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,600
It's for everyone!

143
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,440
That's right.

144
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,810
I don't know what I can do about it.

145
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
But I want to fight by your side!

146
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,020
Huh?

147
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,770
What is that?

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,990
Look at that, people of the world!

149
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,740
At last Terakomari Gandesblood
is giving us her all!

150
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,620
She is going to save the world!

151
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,120
Komari, Komari!

152
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,040
Komari, Komari!

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,040
Komari, Komari!

154
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,590
Your Excellency Gandesblood!

155
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,710
Please share your thoughts!

156
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,470
I will destroy Gera-Alka!

157
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,660
At least we bought time

158
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,490
for the townspeople to escape.

159
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,160
I can't believe it.

160
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,250
I can't face Lady Karen looking like this.

161
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,430
Millicent Blueknight?

162
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,020
You poor things.

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
I'll kill them for you.

164
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,230
With a low level spell like that?

165
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,240
Now go forth 5th Corps.

166
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,540
Go take the burden from them.

167
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,920
I see.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,210
You've been given the 5th Corps
to take over?

169
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,760
Yes, and it's a pain in the ass.

170
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,520
Who are you?

171
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,480
They told me I had to atone
for my sins by earning my keep.

172
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,650
But it looks like she's
decided to join the fight.

173
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,730
Looks like I won't get any credit.

174
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,200
What are you saying? Who is 〝she?〞

175
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,780
A little brat who I hate.

176
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,660
I could kill you if you want.

177
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,250
But I guess it would be
more effective to let her do it.

178
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,170
I'll let you take over for the day

179
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,670
Terakomari!

180
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,710
Hey! Wait right there!

181
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,520
Rainsworth!

182
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,690
It's time to pay the piper!

183
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,070
Don't be ridiculous!

184
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,780
You should just obey my commands!

185
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,650
If you do, I promise you eternal happiness!

186
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,990
Yeah, no thanks.

187
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,740
I'm happy enough
fighting alongside Komari.

188
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,790
Same for you too, right Komari?

189
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,210
Don't you dare look at me

190
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,000
like that!

191
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,890
Ludicrous...

192
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,850
This is ludicrous!

193
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,940
To all across the world who now
hold a grudge against Gera-Alka!

194
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,440
Now is the time to stand up!
I am now taking a stand!

195
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,610
Change back to Alka!

196
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,530
Now's the time to take a stand!

197
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,040
Terakomari Gandesblood...

198
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,580
You're sensing it too, aren't you?

199
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,120
That girl

200
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,540
is a vampire who can lead
people's hearts and minds.

201
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,470
Dance there and dance here! Da dadaaaa!

202
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,970
The brilliance of a true champion!

203
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,560
Her Excellency is truly the most
powerful vampire meant to rule this world.

204
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,740
I have a message from Lord Oomikami.

205
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,990
He wants us to
knock out the Paradise Corps.

206
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,950
Our mission is still ongoing?

207
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,710
Fair enough. Honored brother Kakumei

208
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,550
just might be watching my
battle somewhere out there.

209
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,800
What?

210
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,260
The opportunists at Immortal Haven

211
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,640
have declared war on Gera-Alka?

212
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,310
So then Gera-Alka is my only enemy?

213
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,560
I like the simplicity!

214
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,650
Come, my dear soldiers!

215
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,740
Go forth and leave our enemies in shreds!

216
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,110
Nelia!

217
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,950
You are way out of line!

218
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,870
This won't help you at all!

219
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,250
Come back by my side!

220
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,370
I've come back right now.

221
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,840
To defeat you that is!

222
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,470
What is this?

223
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,350
Wait Komari!

224
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,770
He's mine to put an end to.

225
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,770
You paltry Ji-Lius! Seize Nelia!

226
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,240
Get out of my way!

227
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,240
Rekkaku Liberation, Swift Varja!

228
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,540
A Rekkaku Liberation?

229
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,500
Die!

230
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,460
Terakomari Gandesblood!

231
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,790
That'll be as good as confetti

232
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,010
facing the body of Varja!

233
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,980
This can't be...

234
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
It is.

235
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,700
You inferior species dare to

236
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,870
rise against me!?

237
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,990
Give up.

238
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,250
You are wrong.

239
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,170
I'm never wrong!

240
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,100
Gera-Alka will be destroyed.

241
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,820
Nelia...

242
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,780
My hometown was sold to another country

243
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,750
by King Alka, who always
advocated for pacifism.

244
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,370
I struggled to endure the discrimination

245
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,630
while protecting my young sister.

246
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,130
As I endured it, I burned
with a desire for revenge.

247
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,590
A desire for revenge
against the other races

248
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,390
who bullied us and against
the slow-witted King Alka.

249
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,890
In order to take revenge, I
needed to become stronger.

250
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,860
I needed strength to
get everything I lost back.

251
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,320
You've really got guts.

252
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,410
You could be a good pawn
to help me conquer the world.

253
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,050
I always...

254
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,550
Thought of you...

255
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,590
In your own way

256
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,550
you may have been trying to do
your best for Alka and the Ji-Liu.

257
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,180
But you were working
in the wrong direction.

258
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,270
Nelia, move aside.

259
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,900
Reflect on your mistakes.

260
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,569
Looks like the fight's over.

261
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,410
It's not fair!

262
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,540
How could I fight against such power?

263
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,750
There's no strategy
or plan that would work!

264
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,210
You have been mocking Gera-Alka
from the very beginning!

265
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,720
With the power of Terakomari Gandesblood

266
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,260
you knew the Ji-Liu didn't stand a chance!

267
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,970
So Madhart,

268
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,020
I am aiming to conquer the world.

269
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,770
However, I don't intend to

270
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,860
monopolize the world
by force like you did.

271
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,280
I will make an ideal world
where people help one another.

272
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,030
That is the goal of the Mulnite Empire.

273
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,830
How frivolous. That's impossible!

274
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,370
People are animals that
only think of themselves!

275
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,290
Komari is different.

276
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,000
Guiding people's hearts
in the right direction is

277
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,460
that girl's role.

278
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,510
You can't be serious!

279
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,760
In fact, that 〝Princess Getto〞
was saved by Komari.

280
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,680
People inspired by Komari

281
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,350
forget the foolish idea of
〝subjugating others with force.''

282
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,060
If we can increase those kinds of people

283
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,190
I suspect we'll realize
my nation's ideal world.

284
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,270
I suppose.

285
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,940
All with just a simple girl?

286
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,950
It's about time the curtains close.

287
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,820
Eh?

288
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,290
T-This is--

289
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,710
Happening right now! Give it up!

290
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,130
Mr. President.

291
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,830
After the Great War of the Six Nations,

292
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,330
with the disappearance
of President Madhart,

293
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,340
the Republic of Gera-Alka

294
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,630
will be holding a new
presidential election!

295
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,510
What happened?

296
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,890
Talk to big sis why don't ya?

297
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,390
Lord Ohii is angry with me.

298
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,110
Did you know, Amatsu?

299
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,820
The Inverted Moon has
no mercy for those who fail.

300
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,820
It'll be your head! Your head!

301
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,280
No, our strategy was a big success.

302
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,240
Hey, wait! Don't eat my Taiyaki.

303
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,580
Our strategy succeeded?

304
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,790
Our goal was to destroy Gera-Alka.

305
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,260
First time I'm hearing about it...

306
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,130
Lord Ohii could not forgive Madhart.

307
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,850
They were conducting
cruel human experiments

308
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,510
using the magic core's ability
to infinitely regenerate.

309
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,060
These vicious acts are only
possible because the cores exist.

310
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,110
Lord Ohii would be angry at that.

311
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,860
So we seduced Madhart
with the Sacred Articles

312
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,650
and led him into a war he couldn't win.

313
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,910
Hm?

314
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,030
Then why is Lord Ohii angry with you?

315
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,710
I was told to take care of my family.

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,510
It's been a while since I've come here.

317
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,680
Lady Nelia, I'm sorry for being late.

318
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,510
You are late...

319
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,560
You're the one who called
me here in the first place.

320
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,610
Father?

321
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,690
Nelia!

322
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,990
Father! You're okay!

323
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,950
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

324
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,040
No, you did an amazing job.

325
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,580
You are a much better
Ji-Liu than I ever was.

326
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,460
Father!

327
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,690
DIE!

328
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,280
You Gera-Alka rust buckets!

329
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,030
I'm going to be the one
who gets the free head pat

330
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,030
from Her Excellency!

331
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,280
Hey you! That one was mine!

332
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,490
You're full of it!

333
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,740
I found him first!

334
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,000
I can't abide a thief!

335
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,420
Die!

336
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,380
Rejoice Lady Komari.

337
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,760
-Things are going south for the enemy.
-How could I rejoice at this?

338
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,600
How did it get like this?

339
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,100
Nelia and I were supposed
to have been friends.

340
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,520
I assume she wants to
defeat Lady Komari to grow her popularity

341
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,610
in order to collect votes in the
upcoming presidential election?

342
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,610
I've finally gotten to you.

343
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,740
Komari...

344
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,950
Become my servant!

345
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,620
I'd never do that!

346
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,210
If you want to resist, go for it.

347
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,880
But you are destined to walk beside me.

348
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,050
We both aim to create world peace.

349
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,680
If we combine our power
nobody in the world stands a chance!

350
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,470
Drinking Lady Komari's blood
seems to have gotten to your head.

351
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,980
I envy you.

352
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,480
I'm going to twist your
whole body like a rag

353
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,020
to squeeze Lady Komari's blood out of you.

354
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,360
Stop being scary Vill!

355
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,980
Ms. Villhaze is right!

356
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,110
If I kill her

357
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,120
there'll be nobody in the world
who has tasted Lady Komari's blood!

358
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Now you're saying scary things Sakuna!

359
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,580

360
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,290

Lady Komari!

I knew it.

00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,220
