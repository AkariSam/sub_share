1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,600
Having won the Clash of The Seven

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,530
as a reward I was given
a two week vacation!

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,700
It was given to me, but...

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,690
They didn't tell me I'd be
spending my break at the ocean.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,470
Ms. Komari...

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,860
Your swimsuit looks good on you.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,750
Y-You think so?

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,760
Sakuna, who was a spy of the Inverted Moon,

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,520
and committed a series of
murders of government officials,

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,390
received her punishment from the Empress.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,850
She is being made to lead
her 6th Corps all across

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,530
the land and wage war
against other countries.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,120
According to Sakuna

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,580
she's fought five times this past week

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,820
and won three times.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,010
Ms. Komari!

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,360
The ocean feels great!

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,600
That means she's died twice.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,030
Lady Komari...

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,550
Why are you won over
so easily by Lord Memoir?

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,080
I-I'm not being won over.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,230
I'm just hanging out with Sakuna.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,950
Whatever you say.

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,710
I'm just glad you are interested
in doing something, Lady Komari.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,570
So, come play with me too!

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,250
What've I gotten roped into?

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,320
Terakomari... Gandesblood.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,729
So we finally get to meet.

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,240
To become a writer

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,720
you must experience many things.

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,820
That's why this is

32
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,329
an investment in my future.

33
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,260
I'm definitely not
letting it get me giddy.

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,730
I shouldn't be getting swept up...

35
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,570
Huh?

36
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,680
This is actually kind of fun.

37
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,310
Lady Komari.

38
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,920
Playtime is over.

39
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,280
Oh, why? Come on, let's play some more!

40
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,790
Captain Melakonsi contacted me
during reconnaissance.

41
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,340
It appears Nelia Cunningham

42
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,000
has finished preparing to meet you.

43
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,820
Huh? Nelia?

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,460
What was that?

45
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,170
Lady Komari.

46
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,020
Have you forgotten the reason

47
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,290
we came to this resort in Gera-Alka?

48
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,230
Oh!

49
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,709
It all started when

50
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,430
I received a letter of invitation
from Nelia Cunningham,

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,310
one of the eight honored
generals of this republic

52
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,760
who has a grandiose nickname

53
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,240
like "Princess Moon Peach" or something.

54
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,020
The invitation

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,080
began with a completely
unprovoked accusation that

56
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:38,270
my fighting in the territory of Gera-Alka
constituted an act of aggression.

57
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,810
Then it ended with saying that
they want to invite me to a tea party

58
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,250
to ease tensions between our
countries, which is definitely a trap.

59
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,130
Ha ha ha ha!

60
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,330
Okay Komari, take her up on the offer

61
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,650
and take stock of the
enemy's capabilities!

62
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,770
And with that order from the Empress

63
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,740
it was full steam ahead
into the trap for us.

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,570
But at least my men are here escorting me.

65
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,380
Wait.

66
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,020
I thought they also came to the beach?

67
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,780
Oh, if you're wondering about them...

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,640
They wagered a swimsuit
two-shot photo with you

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,900
competing not in Beach
Flags, but in Beach Towers.

70
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,130
By the way,

71
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,540
the winner is the first one to touch the
"Yumeso Rakuen" where we will be staying.

72
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,910
Why did they start that
without permission?

73
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,750
What should we do, Vill?

74
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,490
I'm not ready to go to
a tea party in enemy territory.

75
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,520
Don't you worry.

76
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,650
I still have my Pandora Poison.

77
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,490
Lord Memoir.

78
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,130
Please suck my blood.

79
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,730
Eh? Ms. Villhaze?

80
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,070
What is there to be embarrassed about?

81
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,070
This is simply for work.

82
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,620
For Lady Komari.

83
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,150
I know but...

84
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,800
Go ahead.

85
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,790
Well then, here I go.

86
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,990
You took too much.

87
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,340
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,720
No, it's okay.

89
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,060
You were quite good.

90
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,090
Thanks...

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,780
It tasted good too.

92
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,940
What is this?

93
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,340
What was I just party to?

94
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,860
I've seen it.

95
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,880
Lord Memoir's future.

96
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,180
Don't worry, you will not die.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,220
Hey, Vill.

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,810
Gera-Alka is the land of
the Senryu species, right?

99
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,640
What are they like?

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,460
To put it simply, they use blades.

101
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,060
I've also heard rumor
part of their bodies are made of metal.

102
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,640
Welcome to the Senryu Tea Party.

103
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,110
Ms. Terakomari Gandesblood.

104
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,580
Good day, I am Nelia.

105
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,870
I would like to express my deepest
gratitude to you for coming all this way.

106
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,140
Okay Gertrude.

107
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,860
Go and prepare a nice cup
of tea for these girls!

108
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,590
As you command, Lady Nelia.

109
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,020
Whoa!

110
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,720
Sorry for the commotion.

111
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,650
She's always been quite clumsy.

112
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,130
Let me greet you once more.

113
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,340
Welcome to the Senryu Tea Party.

114
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,930
By the way, I don't know if
it's proper to ask this but,

115
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,490
why did you send me an invitation?

116
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,690
We've never met, have we?

117
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,860
We have met before.

118
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,840
Oh?

119
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,630
As expected...

120
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,260
I was thinking you
wouldn't remember, Komari.

121
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,970
Oh, may I call you Komari?

122
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,580
You can call me Nelia as well.

123
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,540
Sure, I don't mind.

124
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,890
Thank you.

125
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,500
I feel like we're already closer.

126
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,030
So then...

127
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,890
The rising star Crimson Commander
known throughout the six kingdoms

128
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,159
Terakomari Gandesblood...

129
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,140
The reason I called you here today is

130
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,520
that I wanted to see the essence and power
of such a glorious military presence.

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,070
Oh, I gotcha.

132
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,940
Well, I guess there's no vampire
as easy to understand as me.

133
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,730
Everyone calls me
"The Master of Slaughter" or

134
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,800
many other things like
"The Strongest Vampire."

135
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,000
No matter how I hide it, it's all true!

136
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,210
That's absolutely incredible, Komari!

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,450
There is dignity in every word you say!

138
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,820
A dignity befitting
The Master of Slaughter!

139
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,330
Y-You think so?

140
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,370
Did you notice? I was trying to hide it.

141
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,830
It's so obvious!

142
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,100
You can just tell, you have
the face of a true killer!

143
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,980
I-I have a face like that you think?

144
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,740
So Komari,

145
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,850
how many people have you killed?

146
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,050
Um, around 5,000 I guess?

147
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,110
What a coincidence! Me too!

148
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,540
Someone call the police!

149
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,160
She's a major criminal
who killed 5,000 people!

150
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,010
If you've killed that much, you've passed.

151
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,580
I thought I'd invite you along in the
event your nature met my expectations.

152
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,720
Invite me where?

153
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,710
As part of my plan for world domination.

154
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,100
World... domination?

155
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,090
Yes!

156
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,060
If you and I teamed up we'd be invincible!

157
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,910
The whole world would be our omelet!

158
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,570
I know this is your true hearts desire!

159
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,020
H-Hold on.

160
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,820
What is your plan for world domination?

161
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,530
First we destroy Divine Paradise
who's been annoying me recently.

162
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,330
Next, we'll destroy the cocky
Blue Jade Federation.

163
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,050
Then we destroy the Immortal Haven
who pretend to be neutral.

164
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,800
And while we're at it, we'll
destroy the Kingdom of La Perico.

165
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,590
The perfect plan!

166
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,950
It's perfectly full of holes.

167
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,070
I think world domination isn't right!

168
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,140
Sakuna...

169
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,280
Oh, Sakuna Memoir.

170
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,640
Are you trying to interfere
with Komari's and my ambitions?

171
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,860
Ms. Komari is a person who negotiates
to resolve things whenever possible.

172
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,440
We cannot cooperate with your ambitions.

173
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,510
That's right, Lord Cunningham.

174
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,950
Lady Komari will dominate
the world on her own.

175
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,180
We don't need to go out of our way to
work with a no-name General like yourself.

176
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,750
T-This isn't good.

177
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,380
If you anger a murdering machine
who's killed 5,000 people...

178
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,640
Are you saying you don't need my power?

179
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,890
That's so disappointing!
It's really offensive!

180
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,810
Look, I'll just tell you the truth.

181
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,230
Even if I had the power
to dominate the world

182
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,030
I wouldn't use it recklessly.

183
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,400
That's because I am a pacifist.

184
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,470
You see,

185
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,150
power is not something to
use to subjugate others.

186
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,620
It should be used to
seek peace for the world.

187
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,840
Komari.

188
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,820
-I want to change--
-Your Excellency!

189
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,640
I apologize for interrupting!

190
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440
I have an urgent message for you.

191
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,220
What happened Belius?

192
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,020
The 7th Corps, who was competing for
a swimsuit photo with your Excellency,

193
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,480
encountered Gera-Alka forces stationed
in front of the target hotel.

194
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,120
The 7th Corps charge was
mistaken for an attack

195
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,240
and a battle broke out.

196
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
For some reason the enemy was weak

197
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,390
and we wiped them out in no time.

198
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,460
Weak you say?

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,550
My 1st Corps is the strongest
elite force in Gera-Alka.

200
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,140
Oh, you annihilated Nelia's troops?

201
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
What was that?

202
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,150
Belius, is that...

203
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,960
That'd be Melakonsi.

204
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,510
His hobby is blowing up tall buildings.

205
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,300
Komari.

206
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,640
You've really done it!

207
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,600
Um, I'm sorry...

208
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,600
You think you can make
this okay with an apology?

209
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,690
Alright, the escape route is
already secured, let's fly!

210
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,570
Wait right--

211
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,630
Where are you Komari?

212
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,630
You sure are well prepared!

213
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,170
I did see this future coming.

214
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,090
Then shouldn't there have been
a better way to solve that?

215
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,380
On behalf of Her Excellency Terakomari

216
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,720
I, her maid, Vill conveys this message.

217
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,610
All personnel evacuate, leave the
area immediately, and return to Mulnite.

218
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,100
Gera-Alka has become an enemy nation.

219
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,060
I wonder if everyone can get away.

220
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,020
This is "core territory."

221
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,260
We are within the effective range
of Mulnite's magic cores.

222
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,320
Even if they die they can be resurrected.

223
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,080
Even so, I don't want them to die.

224
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,530
Your Excellency...

225
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,460
Hey there Komari, are you
enjoying the resort?

226
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,940
I wish I could have
been there with you, but alas!

227
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,910
So, Komari.

228
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,640
When you're back, why don't we put
on sun cream by the palace pool?

229
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,840
Really lather it on.

230
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,500
I'd never do that!

231
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,260
I'm hanging up if that's all!

232
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,350
I'm joking!

233
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,620
Actually,

234
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,360
a messenger has come from Divine Paradise

235
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,240
wanting to discuss the
fate of the six nations.

236
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,230
The messenger, named Carla Amatsu

237
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,080
really wants to meet with you, Komari.

238
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,910
I can smell it.

239
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,910
I can smell the scoops on this one.

240
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,320
Ms. Melka, let's not do this anymore.

241
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,790
If they catch us it's the death penalty.

242
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,170
Tio, how's the camera?

243
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,130
Yeah, it's working pretty good.

244
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,390
I took some pictures of a butterfly.

245
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,080
Pictures of a butterfly
isn't going to feed us!

246
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,760
What you need to shoot is a scoop for us!

247
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,490
If you can get a shot of Amatsu Carla

248
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,740
I'll massage your ears
and tail for a week.

249
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,940
Amatsu?

250
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,190
Amatsu...

251
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,610
Carla!

252
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,310
I got a tip that Amatsu Carla,
one of the 5 Sword Emperors

253
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,970
of Divine Paradise has
come to Mulnite incognito!

254
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,590
Let me get straight to the point.

255
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,970
My goal for visiting this country

256
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,200
is for an alliance.

257
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,310
An alliance?

258
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,630
As Her Majesty the Empress likely knows

259
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,150
Divine Paradise and Gera-Alka
are like cats and dogs.

260
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,580
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

261
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,190
I think our interests and
the Mulnite Empire's

262
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,120
are aligned at this point.

263
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,540
They very much are.

264
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,690
Ever since they changed from the Kingdom
of Alka to the Republic of Gera-Alka

265
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,900
competition for territory
has become the norm.

266
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,950
I can't believe Divine Paradise
is offering an alliance.

267
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,090
This is a gigantic scoop!

268
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,450
Um, so Gera-Alka was a kingdom?

269
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,520
Up until five years ago.

270
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,000
The current president Madhart
started a revolution

271
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,200
and transitioned it to a republic.

272
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,310
So you're proposing that

273
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,880
we join hands with Divine Paradise
and face our common enemy?

274
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,710
No.

275
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,180
To speak honestly,
there's no need to face them together.

276
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,410
Our country's policy is
not to engage in useless conflicts.

277
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,610
Rather,

278
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,190
conflict itself is futile.

279
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,940
It is barbaric and vulgar
for people to hurt each other.

280
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,600
It is the height of tactlessness.

281
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,740
I know right!

282
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,120
Oh no...

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,470
I got excited because I've never
met someone who'd understand...

284
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,900
Back to the matter at hand.

285
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,030
If we join hands

286
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,170
Gera-Alka will soon be
unable to touch either nation.

287
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,610
Ms. Gandesblood.

288
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,180
The reason I called you
to this meeting today

289
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,310
is because I need your power.

290
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,790
You have absolute power.

291
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,480
An absolute power
similar to that of mine.

292
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,700
You're that strong, Carla?

293
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,849
We're suddenly on a first name basis?

294
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,730
Oh, sorry.

295
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,369
It's okay I guess.

296
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,290
I am strong.

297
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,290
Not as a pretense or an exaggeration,
but as an objective fact.

298
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,869
I have a world-wide reputation for
being stronger than anyone else.

299
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,420
That's right.

300
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,180
I'm also the strongest.

301
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,859
However, I am actually the strongest.

302
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,050
In any case, I'll ask again.

303
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,150
Would you make
the world a peaceful place with me?

304
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,140
Tell me Carla,

305
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,760
do you want get rid of all conflict?

306
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,610
Of course I do!

307
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,360
It's not an idea
that many people understand, though.

308
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,530
I understand.

309
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,130
No matter how I try to hide it,
I am also a pacifist.

310
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,690
How about we do our best together?

311
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,080
Your Excellency!

312
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,700
A letter has arrived
from Nelia Cunningham to the 7th Corps.

313
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,290
Nelia?

314
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,790
You know one of
the 8 generals of Gera-Alca?

315
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,630
Well, actually

316
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,950
Nelia and I correspond with each other,

317
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,030
and I enjoyed a tea party
with her the other day.

318
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,720
Dear Komari, I'll never forgive you.

319
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,560
I knew it'd say that!

320
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,440
What did you do to her?

321
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880
Vill...

322
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,410
Can't you think of
a good explanation for this?

323
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,930
A good one!

324
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:35,650
The other day, Lady Komari attacked Nelia
Cunningham's forces and destroyed them.

325
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,240
Why couldn't you explain that better?

326
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,430
What is the meaning of this?

327
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,750
Was all that talk about
being a pacifist a lie?

328
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,280
It wasn't a lie, I was...

329
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,350
I cannot understand
the heart of a peace lover.

330
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,550
I'm all for murdering!

331
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,450
You were plotting against me!

332
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,900
It is clear to me now Mulnite
is a nation of barbarians.

333
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,260
I could never work alongside
vampires like you

334
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,110
who rush forward without forethought.

335
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,680
I take back my offer of alliance!

336
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,320
I cannot ignore this.

337
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,240
You suddenly offer us an alliance

338
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,540
then when things break down
you treat us as a barbaric nation?

339
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,960
You've been
behaving quite selfishly, haven't you?

340
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,810
Komari,

341
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,590
kill that fool who insulted Mulnite.

342
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,450
Huh?

343
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,840
No, no, isn't that a little overboard?

344
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,170
Yes Your Excellency, you can do it!

345
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,970
Alright, let's do this!
Prepare yourself Carla!

346
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,870
Just so you know

347
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,290
I was the winner of the
National Murder Competition!

348
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,990
I can kill 5,000 people in 5 seconds!

349
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,230
S-So what!

350
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,830
After killing 5,000 people in 5 seconds

351
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,900
I can kill an additional
50,000 people after that!

352
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,480
Then I can also

353
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,710
kill 50 million people as a bonus
by activating ultimate magic

354
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,850
incidentally turning Mulnite
into scorched earth.

355
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,340
Then I can also--

356
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,820
Ouch...

357
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,650
Don't come near me!

358
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,080
Trying to suddenly kill me, so arrogant!

359
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,150
Listen up Amatsu Carla!

360
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,280
If you don't want to be killed
then ally yourself with Mulnite.

361
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,660
I guess I have no choice.

362
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,920
Wars should not be fought

363
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,420
but at times are unavoidable.

364
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,530
Also, I just remembered

365
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,270
even if there was a war with
Gera-Alka it wouldn't matter.

366
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,350
Because I am the strongest there is.

367
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,220
So, which will it be?

368
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,320
I understand.

369
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,590
I will cooperate in the Mulnite Empire's
fight against Divine Paradise.

370
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,010
Well, I'll just be glad nobody had to die.

371
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,530
Seriously... Why did this happen?

372
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,550
Cunningham.

373
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,050
Looks like you failed to kill Gandesblood.

374
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,570
You got a problem with that?

375
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,530
Of course I do!

376
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,250
Frankly, it's a blunder that
makes me embarrassed for you.

377
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,420
You have no understanding of
the interests of the state.

378
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,350
Your mission was to kill or capture her.

379
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,220
I apologize.

380
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,780
Please try to be at least
a little helpful for me.

381
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,740
You don't want to end up
like your father, do you?

382
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,690
He's so annoying!

383
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,160
-That crusty old man!
-Don't get mad Lady Nelia!

384
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,160
I will change Alka.

385
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,730
Because that is

386
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,190
my duty!

387
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,310
Lady Nelia...

388
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,120
Gertrude.

389
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,590
I will make Komari my servant as well.

390
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,920
She's necessary for my plan.

391
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,250
That vampire

392
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,170
could turn this world upside-down!

393
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,020
THE PRINCESS OF ALKA NATION
