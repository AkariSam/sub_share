1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,170
Uh...

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,840
Who are you?

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,050
I'm someone of great nobility,
just passing through.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,090
Is that a problem?

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,470
It's not, I guess.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,600
Yes, well, then...

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,440
Shall we have a nice chat together?

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,810
Come now, no need to be shy now.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,150
Tonight we all drink as equals!

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,360
That's so funny!

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,150
It's hilarious.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,620
Just as the rumors said,
you behave so freely and recklessly.

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,619
I wonder now!

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
You give free
discretionary power to your underlings,

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,750
so can you really win a war?

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,830
Well, those guys are stupid as hell
and easily excited.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,800
Even if I leave them be,
they'll kill enemies for me.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,170
Even though you do nothing?

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,420
Uh

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,220
Well!

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,510
I mean, it is clear as day
that if I were to get involved

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,060
we'd instantly be victorious so...

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,430
Truly... If you were to get involved

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,350
I'm sure a brilliant, thrilling,

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,350
and one-sided massacre show would begin.

26
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,570
But wouldn't that be boring?

27
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,860
Yeah, yeah...

28
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,360
That's my predicament you see...

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,070
That's exactly correct!

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,620
It's not a battle to kill your enemy.

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,410
It's a battle to the death
to show off your nation's power.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It can only be seen
as an insult to what true war is.

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,590
Y-Yeah...

34
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,380
I guess you could think of it like that.

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,510
That's right. And the one

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,050
who insults war the most

37
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,020
is you, Terakomari.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,350
Huh?

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,900
I'm unable to stomach your way of life.

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,020
After what you have done,

41
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,070
how can you so nonchalantly be
a Crimson Commander?

42
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,740
Why are you able to walk under the sun!?

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,660
Is it that fun to be pampered
like a little baby?

44
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,240
If it weren't for you...

45
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,790
if it weren't for you!

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,870
If it weren't for you, now I'd...

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,580
Ah... Uh...

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,210
Oh, I apologize.

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,380
My name is

50
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,470
Millicent Bluenight!

51
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,480
I've come to pay you back

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,140
a three year old debt.

53
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,370
Your Excellency!

54
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,510
Your... Excellen...

55
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,550
Belius!

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,890
That's unfortunate.

57
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,970
It seems I missed.

58
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,850
It's an intruder!

59
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,940
What are the guards doing!?

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,190
Someone, grab her!

61
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,440
Lady Komari!

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,480
Please get down!

63
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,490
Ooh, that was scary!

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,620
If that hit me I'd be dead!

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,170
I promise you the next ones won't miss.

66
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,710
That's impossible.

67
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,090
You realize don't you?

68
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,470
You must know I'm stronger than you.

69
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,260
What is this?

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,720
What...

71
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,720
is happening?

72
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,190
Was I almost killed?

73
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,730
Belius jumped in to protect me.

74
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,570
You there, clown!

75
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,190
Ruining the emperor's party

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,070
is so bold I am completely entranced.

77
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,370
Are you prepared to die?

78
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,120
I didn't intend to ruin the party at all.

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,080
If I kill you...

80
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,710
and kill Arman Gandesblood,

81
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,830
then

82
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,960
kill little trembling Terakomari
over there

83
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,300
I'd be content with that.

84
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,590
An idiot that can't be reasoned with
must simply be killed.

85
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,640
Now die.

86
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,440
Lady Komari!

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,110
So boring.

88
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,820
I wanted a deathmatch with the real you.

89
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,910
Wha...

90
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,740
What do you mean?

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,450
How could you possibly
understand how I feel?

92
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,460
I don't care about that.

93
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,130
I'm satisfied with how things turned out.

94
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,760
Being chased out of the country
and joining the 'Inverted Moon'

95
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,630
is my destiny.

96
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,840
You're an Inverted Moon?

97
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,260
Yes, what is it to you?

98
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,180
They proclaim things like
"Death is the Essence of Life"

99
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,600
as they plan to destroy
the Magic Cores of each country.

100
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,400
Don't worry, Terakomari.
I'll kill you next.

101
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,980
Without your Magic Core

102
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,150
you can't be revived.

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,610
I'll make you taste true death!

104
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,030
I won't let you escape you savage!

105
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,500
Tsk...

106
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,830
Lady Komari!

107
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,080
Are you injured?

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,210
Why?

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,920
Why did she come here?

110
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,470
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-Lady Komari.

111
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,930
Why...?

112
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,850
Why...

113
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,680
Why is she here

114
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,890
to bully me again?

115
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
ONE WEEK LATER

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,820
We must destroy the Inverted Moon!

117
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,860
Now!

118
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,610
If you lose your cool,

119
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,030
you will just face retaliation.

120
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,530
Have you forgotten?

121
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,990
The attacker used sacred articles.

122
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,830
A wound made by a sacred article
as strong as a Magic Core

123
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,210
cannot be healed by
the power of the actual Magic Cores.

124
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,540
Worst case scenario...

125
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,300
The victim will meet a genuine death.

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,590
What exactly
is the imperial court doing about it?

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,470
The court is
in a meeting from dawn to dusk.

128
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,890
Why is that?

129
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,890
There may be agents still lurking about.

130
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,430
Agents?

131
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,520
Apparently a teleportation gate
was built at the party venue.

132
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,570
Teleportation can't be done

133
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,940
unless two gates are created in advance.

134
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,240
That means

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,200
someone snuck into the venue

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,580
and created the gate.

137
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,290
I see.

138
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,830
I'll gather our team members
and start taking action!

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,750
Lady Komari said

140
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,880
she would wait until I return.

141
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,840
So where is Her Excellency now then?

142
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,550
I hear she is inspecting enemy movements.

143
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,010
Even a close adviser like me
wasn't told the exact location.

144
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,390
Wait a second!

145
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,309
Lieutenant Villhaze...

146
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,390
I cannot overlook this.

147
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,690
The closest advisor

148
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,900
is me.

149
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,730
Hmph...

150
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,650
Do you know
the color of Lady Komari's underwear?

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,650
You don't do you?

152
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,950
You see, I am the closest.

153
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,570
Anyway...

154
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,120
Until we receive word from Lady Komari

155
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,330
we must not make a move.

156
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,170
I think the trigger was something trivial.

157
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,050
It was a seemingly innocuous thing

158
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,800
that brought Millicent's wrath.

159
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,760
And by the time I realized it

160
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,640
there was no way it could be taken back.

161
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,060
Even so...

162
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,400
I never gave in to their bullying.

163
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,150
These kids

164
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,780
were only able to feel happiness
when hurting others.

165
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,110
I actually felt bad for them.

166
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,070
That's how I was able to endure it.

167
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,580
Until...

168
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,540
Hey, that pendant...

169
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,290
Can I borrow it?

170
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,170
It was my mother's keepsake pendant...

171
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,510
I completely lost it.

172
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,180
You did such a great job!

173
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,600
Take a look!

174
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,430
Her nose is bleeding.

175
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,400
That's right.

176
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,860
We can forgive you
but we'll have to take a pinky.

177
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,370
I don't remember what happened after that.

178
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,210
When I woke up I was in tatters,

179
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,460
lying in my bed.

180
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,170
I'm not actually
cut out for the Seven Crimson Skies.

181
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,380
I'm shy no matter where I go.

182
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,180
I'm just a simple shut-in.

183
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,800
That's why...

184
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,800
That's why...

185
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,390
I'm not going outside...

186
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,020
Ever again.

187
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,400
Excuse me.

188
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,190
Lady Komari.

189
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,650
How are you doing?

190
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,490
Vill...

191
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,360
Omelet rice is on the menu for supper.

192
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,820
Your favorite right?

193
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,330
There's no other way out of this.

194
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,670
Her Excellency's hair.

195
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,220
The ultimate gem I was finally able to get.

196
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,970
With this,
I can use my magic to find her location!

197
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,310
But at the same time
it will turn to magic and disappear!

198
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,350
Gah!

199
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,730
Net of Attraction!

200
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,950
I found you!

201
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,330
Vill, why are you so worried about me?

202
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,580
Isn't it obvious?

203
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,290
Because I love Milady

204
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,330
more than anything else.

205
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,090
I don't understand.

206
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,170
Are you my long-lost sister or something?

207
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,380
No...

208
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,470
We aren't sisters or anything like that.

209
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,930
Then why?

210
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,730
Oh?

211
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,730
All of my feelings are written in here.

212
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,360
When you have some time, read it.

213
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,400
If...

214
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,570
I feel like it.

215
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,820
Lady Komari...

216
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,450
There are many people
who are worried for you.

217
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,000
People, who don't care

218
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,290
about things like

219
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,880
your abilities as a general,
or intelligence.

220
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,540
They just worry for you.

221
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,340
There are more of us than you--

222
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,300
Huh?

223
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,060
Good afternoon...

224
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,230
Terakomari.

225
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,020
Lady Komari...

226
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,870
Don’t worry.

227
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,750
This knife isn't sacred.

228
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,750
She'll recover if left on her own.

229
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,960
Why are you here?

230
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,590
Didn't I tell you?

231
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,340
I said I'd see you again.

232
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,430
Vill!

233
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,890
If you scream I'll kill you!

234
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,810
If you struggle I'll kill you.

235
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,980
Stand right there

236
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,110
and listen to what I have to say.

237
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,110
Good, such a good girl.

238
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,780
Alright, I'll get right down to it.

239
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,500
I didn't come here to kill you.

240
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,290
I came in preparation to play out

241
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,080
an even more tragic murder.

242
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,460
In preparation?

243
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,090
There are a lot of things here
that can get in the way.

244
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,550
That's why...

245
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,220
I'd like for you
to go to the place I'll direct you to now.

246
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,850
You're not quite ready
to come along so suddenly right?

247
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,230
I had expected as much.

248
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,940
You've always been such a trash crybaby

249
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,650
and so indecisive.

250
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,190
Only your silly sense of justice
is second to none.

251
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,740
That's why I'll do this...

252
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,320
Just like three years ago...

253
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,790
I'll take this one.

254
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,750
To get it back, exactly by midnight,

255
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,210
come to
the "Abandoned Castle of Rue La Nerient.''

256
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,790
Be even one second late,

257
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,960
and I will kill Villhaze.

258
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,340
Oh, and of course come by yourself.

259
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,180
If you tell anyone about this...

260
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,510
You know what happens.

261
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,890
Alright, it's a promise.

262
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,250
That's it...

263
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,670
I'm going to stay shut-in forever.

264
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,510
It shouldn't matter to me...

265
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,630
what happens to that perverted maid.

266
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,180
It shouldn't matter to me...

267
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,180
It shouldn't...

268
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,980
But...

269
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,310
Vill would never

270
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,690
abandon me.

271
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Dear Lady Komari.

272
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,880
The season of the hidden moon has passed.

273
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,920
Now, we begin to hear
the footsteps of full-fledged summer...

274
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,130
and I hope you're well.

275
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,800
Now, without any unnecessary preamble,

276
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,810
I'll get to the point.

277
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,390
I met you Lady Komari

278
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,230
three years ago.

279
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,770
Surprising, isn't it?

280
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,230
At the time,

281
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,610
I was a hopelessly horrible student

282
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,740
attending the Imperial Academy.

283
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,490
It was the law of nature

284
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,780
that someone so weak would suffer.

285
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,990
I was such a person.

286
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,750
Kids in my class bullied me.

287
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,000
The leader of the bullies

288
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,540
was Millicent Bluenight.

289
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,090
Hey Villy!

290
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,050
This one is no good, she's broken.

291
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,640
It's no fun if she doesn't react.

292
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,470
Should we just kill her then?

293
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,520
-Huh?
-What?

294
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,730
I'll blow your head off!

295
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,990
S... Stop...

296
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,030
Stop it!

297
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,990
Oh!

298
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,250
Among the days of

299
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,040
dark and cold despair that befell me

300
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,750
appeared you, Lady Komari.

301
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,460
A ray of saving light.

302
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,010
However...

303
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,760
After that,

304
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,930
things took a horrible turn.

305
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,060
Even though I saw you
being treated cruelly by Millicent...

306
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,070
I couldn't step forward

307
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,780
like you did for me in the past.

308
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,650
This is the sin

309
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,780
that I am guilty of.

310
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,700
I was a coward.

311
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,700
You saved me
but I didn't return the favor.

312
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,500
All I could do was tremble,

313
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,170
hiding in the shadows until the day

314
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,920
Milady became a shut-in

315
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,300
and Millicent eventually disappeared.

316
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,130
That is why.

317
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,470
I decided to atone.

318
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,890
It was so strange that

319
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,350
the life of someone so kind
would be ruined

320
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,470
by someone so insolent.

321
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,810
It wasn't right.

322
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,350
So as soon as I graduated from the academy

323
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,310
my wish was granted

324
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,730
and I was hired as a maid.

325
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,490
When the topic of your appointment came up

326
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,200
I asked to be nominated to support you.

327
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,740
I've been writing for a while now

328
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,540
but what I want to tell you isn't long.

329
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,660
You are an amazing person Lady Komari.

330
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,000
You are stronger than everyone,

331
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,000
kinder than everyone,

332
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,250
and shine brighter than everyone.

333
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,720
Like Millicent,

334
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,430
if someone
returns to your life to spite you,

335
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,430
just ignore it.

336
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,390
If things get hard,
then please rely on me.

337
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,480
I once betrayed you, Lady Komari.

338
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,860
I will never make such a mistake again.

339
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,030
If you say you do not wish to move forward,

340
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,860
I will not make you.

341
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,950
I'll stay by your side regardless.

342
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,070
My atonement and my wish is

343
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,080
to make you happy, Lady Komari.

344
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Vill...

345
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,170
Why didn't I remember her?

346
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,170
Something's wrong with me for forgetting.

347
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,420
Damn it!

348
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,600
Ah, Your Excellency!

349
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,930
I've finally found you!

350
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,560
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,480
I shut myself in.

352
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,650
You must be joking!

353
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,940
Is it not finally time for our revenge

354
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,190
upon the Inverted Moons?

355
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,940
The squad members

356
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,570
have been waiting for this moment as well.

357
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh!

358
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,580
-Belius!
-I am unworthy.

359
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,750
Belius Innu Cerberus...

360
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,880
I will follow Her Excellency
wherever she goes!

361
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Chaostel Konte will also follow.

362
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,960
Yeeeah!

363
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,630
Thank you.

364
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,180
Thanks to you all I feel ready!

365
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,600
So, I'm going

366
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,600
to go and settle the deal
with these terrorists.

367
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
So

368
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,900
you know where the enemy is?

369
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,020
Yes. However,

370
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,360
I cannot allow you to join.

371
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,610
No way!

372
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,190
Your Excellency, why?

373
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,740
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,950
This is my battle to fight.

375
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,990
Wait at the Seven Crimson Court,

376
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,200
and pray for your great general's success.

377
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,750
If you can do that for me...

378
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,790
That's all I'll need

379
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,670
to give me courage.

380
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,630
Hey!

381
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,800
What is that?

382
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,430
You can't tell?

383
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,510
That is Villhaze.

384
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,510
She's the Gandesblood's maid.

385
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,680
I know...

386
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm trying to ask
why the hell she is here!

387
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,520
As a hostage of course.

388
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,730
I guess she's a terrorist after all.

389
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,530
I shouldn't have been helping her.

390
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,200
Hey...

391
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,780
If you're able to kill Terakomari,

392
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,040
I'll--

393
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,040
What are you doing!?

394
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
You know that knife is sacred!

395
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,580
She'll really die!

396
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,170
"Really die?"

397
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,630
You're speaking nonsense now...

398
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,180
You lack the awareness

399
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,760
needed to support the Inverted Moons.

400
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,220
Let me ask you something.

401
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,350
What meaning is there
in a killing without death?

402
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,640
Go ahead, answer.

403
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,570
F-For things like war it stands to--

404
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,320
You know that saying stupid things

405
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,780
causes me to kill you.

406
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,590
You came!

407
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,380
Terakomari.

408
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,150
