1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,700
Damn it. Magic again!

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,050
Blasted Vampires!

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,930
Bash them before they use magic--

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,810
Argh!

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,440
Flame, oh, flame.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,270
Ice, oh, ice.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,700
I have a message.

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,330
Laperico's army have been defeated.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,250
We, the Komari Corps, are
the undisputed victors!

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,460
Take that, lowly brutes.

11
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,420
Let's celebrate victory as
we drink the blood of the beasts!

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,300
Don't get carried away.

13
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,310
It's still not a clear victory.

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,430
You never know if
the enemy has a secret weapon.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,730
You're celebrating already?

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,530
How pathetic you are.

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,270
Be ashamed of yourselves.

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,070
This war is

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,360
the Mulnite's Empire

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,250
We must not be defeated.

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,870
Isn't that right?

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,500
Her Excellency Terakomari.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,170
Yes, Kaostel is right.

24
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,720
Listen, everybody!

25
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,020
I am the one and only
Terakomari Gandesblood!

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,940
3rd year professional shut-in.

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,950
THE VEXATIONS OF
A SHUT-IN VAMPIRE PRINCESS

28
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:05,600
#1: SHUT-IN VAMPIRE, OUT AND ABOUT

29
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,040
I've always thought the world
is an unreasonable place.

30
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,920
15 years ago,

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,670
I was born
a highly respected aristocrat,

32
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,670
part of the Gandesblood family.

33
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,340
For 1000 years, the Gandesblood family

34
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,640
has been a prestigious house
of Mulnite Commanders.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,770
And so, there were expectations of me,

36
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,060
that I tried to meet,

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,310
but I failed.

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,500
Every possible talent, I lacked.

39
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,000
Number one, I cannot use magic.

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,130
Number two, I suck at physical activities.

41
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,800
Number three, I am short.

42
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,630
The reason I struggle with
these three issues

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,630
is obvious.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,430
I am a vampire, but I can't drink blood.

45
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,520
They say I have to do it or I won't grow,

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,100
but I just can't.

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,770
Why not, you ask?

48
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,480
I can't stand anything about blood.

49
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,150
With all that said, my life has been

50
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,030
nothing but bitter memories.

51
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,820
In a society
where power is everything…

52
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,530
I swore to be
a righteous and peaceful vampire,

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,040
so I decided to become a shut-in.

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,590
It's so itchy!

55
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,550
Huh?

56
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,510
The Mulnite national emblem?

57
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,300
Why?

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,560
Good morning, Lady Terakomari.

59
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,880
Who the hell are you?

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,930
Why are you in my room?

61
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,940
I'm late in introducing myself.

62
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,480
My name is Villhaze.

63
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,360
I belong to the Mulnite Imperial Army,

64
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,310
as a Junior Third Class
Special Lieutenant.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,860
As of today, I will be

66
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,620
Miss Terakomari's personal maid.

67
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,620
Even so…

68
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,660
Pardon my directness,

69
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,250
but your room is a bit of a mess.

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,959
What do you want? Is it money?

71
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,630
Please do not be so frightened.

72
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,300
I am an ally of the Lady Terakomari.

73
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,510
Hey. Villhaze or whatever,

74
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,310
wait here for a minute.

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,020
We have no time for that.

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,190
We must depart for the Court right away.

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,610
Get off me! I have to pee!

78
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,409
This is not the time to urinate.

79
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,030
Please listen to me.

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,990
Do you want me to pee myself?

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,620
Listen while you pee.

82
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,950
Isn't that perverse?

83
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,330
We're in a hurry, so please obide.

84
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,710
No! You'll just kidnap me!

85
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,290
Because I am a one-in-a-million beauty!

86
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,300
You're saying that yourself?

87
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,590
Let her go, Vill.

88
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,720
Oh! Komari!

89
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,970
Are you hurt?

90
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,850
It hurts. I'm dying.

91
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,650
More importantly, Dad!

92
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,310
What the hell is this girl?

93
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,360
This is Vill,

94
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,740
your new personal maid.

95
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,360
I don't need a maid.

96
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,370
Especially such a scary one…

97
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,790
Even so,

98
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,120
this was the Empress' decision.

99
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,210
The Emperess? What do you mean?

100
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Let me explain that to you.

101
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,090
Lady Terakomari.

102
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,670
Do you know the Crimson Sky Seven?

103
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,170
What's with that, out of the blue…

104
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,630
No, I know, but…

105
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,470
The Crimson Sky Commanders

106
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,180
lead the Mulnite Army.

107
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,850
Those seven are
the fiercest of all vampires.

108
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,020
You have now become one of them.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,900
Huh?

110
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,070
The other day,

111
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,190
I asked if you would start working soon.

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,610
And you said,

113
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,030
If I could be an empress,
I wouldn't mind working.

114
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,950
I was so moved!

115
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,580
So I said to Her Majesty,

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,380
'Let Komari take over the throne!'

117
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,130
Are you insane?

118
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,420
I did my best for you.

119
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,420
The Majesty was furious,

120
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,260
but I insisted that you are

121
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,390
an absolute genius

122
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,680
and a one-in-a-million beauty!

123
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,180
Then her Majesty said it was funny.

124
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,890
It ain't funny!

125
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,400
So Her Majesty made a contract with you,

126
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,820
and appointed you
to the Seven Crimson Skies.

127
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,780
I don't remember
signing anything like that.

128
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,990
She snuck in last night.

129
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,990
Who did?

130
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,740
Her Majesty.

131
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,659
Huh?

132
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,700
While Milady was sleeping,

133
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,659
you kissed, then signed it.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,290
WHAT?!

135
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,920
Oh, oh, oh!

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,630
Well done, Komari!

137
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,050
You're as sweet as ever!

138
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm happy to see you, my dear!

139
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,840
I'm honored, but…

140
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,470
Your Majesty…

141
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,890
You're very close.

142
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,230
Ah, I want to touch your boobs!

143
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,640
Can I please?

144
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,150
Your Majesty, please, don't be silly.

145
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,190
She will cry.

146
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,900
I'm just joking!

147
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,950
I am the type to value your feelings!

148
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,360
I won't touch them until you're ready.

149
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,240
Didn't you kiss me?

150
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,250
That is hilarious!

151
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,370
Politeness doesn't suit you.

152
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,750
I'll have you treat me

153
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,300
like an old friend.

154
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,470
I ain't never had a single friend.

155
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,260
Well.

156
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,100
Terakomari Gandesblood.

157
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,220
The reason I summoned you here.

158
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,900
'Things to know
as a Crimson Commander!'

159
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,980
'Explanation Segment! Whew whoo!'

160
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,690
What is that picture?

161
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,950
The Seven have
only one condition they must meet.

162
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,570
They must wage
and win a war every three months.

163
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,910
If they win 100 wars,

164
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,910
one can become
a candidate to be the next monarch!

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,750
That's way too hard though.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,540
But if you keep getting defeated…

167
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,750
I'll get sacked?

168
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,090
Yep, you'll explode and lose your head.

169
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,179
You've got to be joking! Give me a chance!

170
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,470
Do not worry.

171
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,179
You'll have the 500 men
in the Seventh Corps under you.

172
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,470
Though all of them are the kind to

173
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,020
try to kill you if they think you're weak.

174
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,360
They're no better than the enemy then!

175
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,230
I'll feel so unsafe!

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,280
They're vampires,

177
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,200
so all of them are
as power-hungry as the next.

178
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,840
Komari….

179
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,950
You're actually weak, aren't you?

180
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,210
Yeah, I'm super weak!

181
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,840
Dying hurts like hell, right?

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,510
It hurts more than
stubbing your little toe!

183
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,090
You don't want to die?

184
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,800
Nobody wants to die!

185
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,260
Then we'll keep it a secret.

186
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,180
No matter what,

187
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,770
you must act strong in front of your men.

188
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,890
Your maid there will help you with that.

189
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,650
Let me help you, Milady.

190
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,400
I'll make sure the men overestimate you.

191
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,280
This all worries me.

192
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,160
You won't undermine me, will you?

193
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,950
Of course not.

194
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,330
Because I love Milady
more than anything else.

195
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,210
That's definitely a lie.

196
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,830
We literally just met.

197
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,210
It suits you well, Lady Komari.

198
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,220
You think so?

199
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,100
Well, I am
a one-in-a-million beauty after all!

200
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,430
I guess everything suits me!

201
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,810
It's great. It's super cute.

202
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,440
When we get back,

203
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,690
let's do a Lady Komari Fashion show!

204
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,400
Absolutely not.

205
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,530
Come on, Lady Komari.

206
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,740
Your new subordinates are waiting.

207
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,370
Right…

208
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,050
This definitely weighs more

209
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,500
than a million tons.

210
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,550
There's no way that's true.

211
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,970
Any normal vampire can open it.

212
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,760
Too bad I'm an abnormal weakling!

213
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,010
Do your best, Milady.

214
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,140
You…! Don't just stand there.

215
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,430
Help me!

216
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,270
Oh, it open--

217
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,440
I'll kill you,

218
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,150
Honorable High Commander!

219
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,080
Lady Komari, are you okay?

220
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,250
I-I -I-I…

221
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,160
I'm-I'm-I'm….

222
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,670
There, there. Good girl.

223
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,000
What do I do?

224
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,130
They probably found out I'm super weak.

225
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,760
Don't worry, Madam.

226
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,550
You happened to beat the insolent rebel.

227
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,140
Vill, that…

228
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,360
- He is dead
- He's dead!?

229
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,810
Oh my God, how'd this happen…

230
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,030
Should we put flowers?

231
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,230
A fool like him you can just spit at.

232
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,070
We'd better get going.

233
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,820
Your men await.

234
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,830
They welcomed me with mutiny.

235
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,880
Can I really make it back

236
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,330
alive?

237
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,110
Your Excellency, I am impressed.

238
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,080
With one single blow, you killed

239
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,950
THE REMAINS OF JOHAN

240
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,910
Johan Herders,

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,370
despite how bloodthirsty he was!

242
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,460
Pffh!

243
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,380
I can take out someone like him
with just my little finger.

244
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,010
No way…

245
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,300
-Wow.
-The new Commander is something.

246
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,970
By the way, as a child

247
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,390
Lady Komari murdered
a hundred vampires with her pinky.

248
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,600
If she decides to get serious,

249
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,270
she can kill all of you in five seconds.

250
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,930
Don't say that stuff!

251
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,650
Anyone can tell those are lies.

252
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,530
Quit the thumbs-up.

253
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,410
Your additions were not nice!

254
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,490
Ahem.

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,280
Anyway, how about I introduce myself?

256
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,420
Of course, Milady!

257
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,250
The Seventh Unit's… No.

258
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,160
The Komari Corps members are

259
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,180
sincerely looking forward
to your self-introduction!

260
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,560
Everyone!

261
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,060
I am the new Crimson Sky Commander

262
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,380
Terakomari Gandesblood!

263
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,940
Now that I am your commander,

264
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,440
you are done with

265
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,790
the sweet and…

266
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,750
Lady Komari's nerves made her halt.

267
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,500
How was it? Cute right?

268
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,710
No, come on! Support me properly!

269
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,760
You are done with the sweet and easy life!

270
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,930
Never again!

271
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,090
From now on, it's war every day!

272
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,100
Bloodshed will be constant!

273
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,470
It is a daily carnage!

274
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,980
But rest assured.

275
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,270
You guys just shut up and follow me!

276
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,270
Don't you dare think of
silly things like succession!

277
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,190
All you must do is follow

278
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,490
Terakomari Gandesblood

279
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,160
as beautiful, smart, and strong as I am!

280
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,620
I promise you!

281
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,910
Do as I say and wage war,

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,710
and you can enjoy
endless days of pleasure!

283
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,320
Our first enemies
the Kingdom of Laperico is led by monkeys!

284
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,970
It is a piece of cake!

285
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,720
We must do more than win!

286
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,970
Let the world know!

287
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,510
That I

288
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,100
Terakomari Gandesblood

289
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,980
will be the the ruler of the world!

290
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,270
Urgent report!

291
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,850
Lieutenant Bilius
took out the enemy general!

292
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,360
Our army has won!

293
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,660
Had I gone onto the battlefield

294
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,620
I could've shredded him
in all but three seconds.

295
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,610
Three seconds?

296
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,870
No, that's wrong!

297
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,280
One second! Just one!

298
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,290
Each one of them killed in a second!

299
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,290
Whoa!!

300
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,790
Komarin! Komarin!

301
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,040
Komarin! Komarin!

302
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,050
Well done, everybody!

303
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,550
But not all our enemies are beasts!

304
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,550
The Ji-Liu's Gera-Alka and the Blue Jade!

305
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,350
They shall know my power!

306
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,890
And then there's, um…

307
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,100
Divine Paradise and Immortal Haven.

308
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,980
Right!

309
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,100
Divine Paradise and Immortal Haven!

310
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,730
We'll beat them to pulps!

311
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,610
That's right!

312
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,740
You all just follow the powerful me!

313
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,620
Be honest and obedient at all times!

314
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,620
Never rebel! Don't even think about it!

315
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,500
You'll just trust and shield me!

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,340
Come, conquer, dear soldiers!

317
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,510
There is glory
in the vivid color of blood.

318
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,510
Komarin! Komarin!

319
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,270
How did this happen?

320
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,020
May I have a moment?

321
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,440
I am Melca Tiano from Six Nation News.

322
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,910
Lady Terakomari Gandesblood,

323
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,860
May I please have an interview?

324
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,700
Okay, okay! Ask whatever you want.

325
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,830
But first,

326
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,580
can you step back a little?

327
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,830
Thank you!

328
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,830
How did you become
a Commander of the Crimson skies?

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,330
What's your relationship with the Empress?

330
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,460
What's your favorite food?

331
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,960
Did you really kill a hundred vampires
with just your pinky?

332
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,090
Do you have a lover?
When was your first kiss?

333
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,920
Step back!

334
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,340
The strong do not speak with words.

335
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,470
I reckon that's a problem for you,

336
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,350
so I'll offer you a few words.

337
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,060
What I will do

338
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,099
is a simple conquest!

339
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,230
I, Terakomari Gandesblood,

340
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,700
will wipe out the commanders
of the other five nations

341
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,319
and spread the glory of Mulnite
throughout the world!

342
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,329
Got it?

343
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,490
Amazing.

344
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,170
By the way,
my favorite food is Omelette rice!

345
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,000
That's all!

346
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,790
Ah… this is a Crimson Sky Seven.

347
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,630
An amazing vampire!

348
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,010
I thank the gods

349
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,890
that I live in
the same time as Her Excellency.

350
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,600
Please look this way! Amazing!

351
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,890
She's weird.

352
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,160
Been a while since I last died…

353
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,410
Dying really is tough.

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,630
In this world

355
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,960
there is no such thing
as a war of life and death.

356
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,170
The six nations of this world

357
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,970
each possesses

358
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,550
a supreme divine tool
with infinite magical power.

359
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,060
They're "Magic Cores."

360
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,310
And within the range of the Magic Core,

361
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,560
no matter how deep the wound,

362
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,610
or how brutal the manner of death,

363
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,950
after some time, you will recover fully.

364
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,450
With that being said,

365
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,240
the place I stand now is the Core Region.

366
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,450
It's a special area where
the six Magic Cores overlap,

367
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,460
and wars between nations
primarily take place here.

368
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,210
How do you like it, Lady Komari?

369
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,840
This is what we call
an entertainment war.

370
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,590
How can it be

371
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,470
such absurdity exists?

372
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,570
Good morning, Lady Komari.

373
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,040
What are you doing here?

374
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,290
Why are you naked?

375
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,670
Put some clothes on!

376
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,800
Lady Komari, please see today's paper.

377
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,390
Yesterdays pictures are in there.

378
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,970
Seriously?

379
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,060
You want me to read right now?

380
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,480
'The new Crimson Sky Commander

381
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,820
will turn the world into omelettes.'

382
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,320
'I love omelette rice.

383
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,450
I will wipe out
the Commanders of the other nations,

384
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,910
and like one carelessly pours ketchup,

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,870
I'll gut them like
an inside-out omelette.'

386
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,590
This is nothing but fake news!

387
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,510
This will definitely provoke the others.

388
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,380
It will.

389
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,470
Looking at that,

390
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,890
that chimpanzee from yesterday

391
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,350
will never be forgiven.

392
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,600
I will put her through
absolute humiliation

393
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,100
for making criminal threats
in a national newspaper.

394
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,440
No!

395
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,780
Don't worry Madam.

396
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,150
I will protect your virtues.

397
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,160
I trust you the least!

398
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,990
Milady, your schedule for today…

399
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,490
I can't hear you!

400
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,080
I'm taking today off!

401
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,540
If you intend to stay
under the covers forever,

402
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,330
I have an idea.

403
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,920
If you come even one step closer…

404
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,340
I'll start wailing.

405
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,590
The Strawberry Milk Equation.

406
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,350
'I wanted a love like strawberry milk.

407
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,850
Sweet and mellow.

408
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,980
Not a single sting to tease the tongue,

409
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,360
but warm and gentle to the end.

410
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,360
a love like a sunny spot.'

411
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,900
Stop it!

412
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,070
I found it in your trash bin.

413
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,700
I didn't expect to find a romance novel.

414
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,170
If you continue playing hooky,

415
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,630
I will distribute this to the court.

416
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,460
With your name on it.

417
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,590
Huh?

418
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,340
Are you listening?

419
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,470
I'll do whatever you say.

420
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,890
Just, please.

421
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,810
Don't tell it to anyone.

422
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,360
Do not worry.

423
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,070
I would never do that.

424
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,700
Th-thank you, Vill.

425
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,740
You smell amazing!

426
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,200
The real thing is

427
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,040
so much better than a pillow!

428
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,290
I want to be embraced by
this strawberry milk scent

429
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,170
and ascend to Heaven!

430
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,920
I've never been so repulsed!

431
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,140
I'm so tired…

432
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,060
I don't remember the last time

433
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,150
I talked that much with someone.

434
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,490
Resist just a little, won't you?

435
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,450
Stop…

436
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,750
It hurts…

437
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,960
No…

438
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,980
I'll never allow that.

439
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,000
