1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,420
Become a kind person, Nelia.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,090
Kinder than anyone else.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,260
I want to be the strongest in the world!

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,810
Madhart said that Arca is the strongest

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,100
nation in the world!

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,230
The Jiu-Liu are the strongest race!

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,110
The world is meant to be
monopolized by the Jiu-Liu!

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,610
-Yeah!
-That's right!

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,940
This is the in-home instructor

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,740
Yurin Gandesblood,
Her Excellency one of The Seven.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,990
Say hello to her.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,580
Little Nelia, nice to meet you.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,660
Hmph!

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,670
You mustn't make enemies
unnecessarily, my dear.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,550
When you are in trouble

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,420
nobody will come to your aid.

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,340
At that time I didn't

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,350
even try to understand her words.

19
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,440
Why did this happen?

20
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,070
If we ally ourselves with the Mulnites,

21
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,950
Divine Paradise will be swept up in a war and I'll die.

22
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,990
Terakomari Gandesblood!

23
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,040
She was a murderer
just like her reputation.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,500
She had me fooled thinking
she was a pacifist like me.

25
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,170
Terakomari has an
incredible Rekkaku Liberation.

26
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,720
She isn't a worthless worm
 like you, Lady Carla.

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,590
I know, you don't have to tell me!

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,060
I'm just an ankle-biter forcing herself

29
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,020
to act the role of a powerful general.

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,020
What will you do? Die?

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,350
I may not be good at fighting

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,610
but I always have this!

33
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,400
A nice echo... empty.

34
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,410
An empty sky is full of possibility.

35
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,570
My mind keeps

36
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,490
coming up with strategies
to keep Divine Paradise away

37
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,079
from the flames of war.

38
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,750
If Mulnite requests
our reinforcements we can

39
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,630
just say we're busy and ignore them.

40
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,090
Lady Carla, it really is empty up there.

41
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,260
Pacifists make every
effort to avoid combat!

42
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,640
But we must defeat Gera-Alka.

43
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,310
I know that Koharu.

44
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,270
The Dream Paradise is suspicious.

45
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,810
The people of Divine Paradise who
disappeared along the border

46
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,060
must have ended up there.

47
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,070
The Mulnite Empire and Divine Paradise

48
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,740
have joined hands and
intend to destroy our Dream Paradise.

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,660
This can't end with
a simple expression of regret.

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,830
Don't you think so, gentlemen?

51
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,800
Mr. President, please give me
 a chance to clear my name.

52
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,380
-This time I will--
-It was you who

53
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,430
failed to capture
her in the first place

54
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,140
allowing damage to Dream Paradise.

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,770
Now you are asking for a chance
after not taking responsibility?

56
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,110
As expected of the "princess" of Alka.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,610
-She must have a hero complex.
-Why is this girl playing at hero?

58
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,610
She's part of the royalty
that oppressed her people.

59
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,659
Nelia Cunningham.

60
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,870
Unlike for your father, I
will forgo incarceration.

61
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,580
However, you are stripped
of all rights as royalty.

62
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,470
Nelia, that was a terrible blunder.

63
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,800
It has nothing to do with you.

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,220
Would you not touch
me with your dirty hands?

65
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,230
You are definitely cuter
when you try to be scary.

66
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,940
It's time to give up on
restoring the kingdom.

67
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,320
Stop trying to be a general
and come live in peace under me.

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,570
I would...

69
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,200
I would never bow to
such a corrupt person.

70
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,910
I'll make sure to expose your evil

71
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,660
and change Alka!

72
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,910
I will blow away Madhart!

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,370
The next president is going to be me!

74
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,590
Good luck with that, "princess."

75
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,470
Lady Nelia...

76
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,140
I'm okay Gertrude.

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,020
Teacher...

78
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,650
Lady Komari, wake up.

79
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,160
There's work to do.

80
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,030
Work?

81
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,240
An emergency task force meeting.

82
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,170
The Empress and the Crimson Commanders
 are waiting for you.

83
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,500
Tell them I overslept.

84
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,170
There's no need.

85
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,920
They are all right here.

86
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,090
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,110
Huh? Is this a dream?

88
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,020
You wouldn't wake up Lady Komari

89
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,690
so I brought your bed to the meeting.

90
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,990
What were you thinking?

91
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,280
That's what we are
wondering Ms. Gandesblood!

92
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,830
Sleeping on the emergency
meeting table is outrageous!

93
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,700
You are right.

94
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,040
Good morning Komari.

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,540
Go ahead and take your seat.

96
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,090
Eh? Ah...

97
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,840
Lady Komari, right here.

98
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,720
Hey, Vill...

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,180
This is the Mulnite Palace right?

100
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,930
No, it is the Fort City Fall.

101
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,600
You brought me all the way
here while I was sleeping?

102
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,020
So, what's this meeting about?

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,270
A statement was received from Gera-Alka

104
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,730
and this meeting is to address it.

105
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,150
From the President of Gera-Alka,

106
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,950
a notification for Terakomari Gandesblood,

107
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,370
part of the Mulnite Alliance.

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,540
We have determined that the outrage of

109
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,500
your alliance and the actions of
General Terakomari Gandesblood

110
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,000
are a threat to the Six Nations.

111
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,710
Therefore, our country declares war

112
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,130
against the Mulnite Alliance.

113
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,170
This means war?

114
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,420
That's correct.

115
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,260
And this is all my fault?

116
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,640
You just pulled the trigger.

117
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,220
This war was just a matter of time.

118
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,310
Why am I singled out as the leader?

119
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,810
This picture has been floating around.

120
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,230
What?

121
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,060
What is that?

122
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,690
What should the leader even do?

123
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,570
Go on a massacre.

124
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,150
You know I don't want to!

125
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,410
I was hoping to sneak
away to the pool today!

126
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,120
I would love to join you but...

127
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,950
Lady Komari.

128
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
Huh?

129
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,660
Everyone is watching you.

130
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,130
Today I was secretly
thinking of making a pool

131
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,130
out of my enemy's blood and playing in it.

132
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,930
You see!

133
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,140
It seems our leader is intent
on crushing the enemy army!

134
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,100
-I can't see.
-This is hardly the usual war for sport.

135
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,850
According to our scout's information

136
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,020
pretty much all eight generals
of Gera-Alka are active.

137
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,400
The enemy is aiming for here

138
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
the Fort City Fall, correct?

139
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,870
If this place were occupied the
Mulnite Empire and part of Divine Paradise

140
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,910
could easily be captured.

141
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,410
Huh?

142
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,120
Our strategic goals are twofold.

143
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,330
Destroying the enemies that marches here.

144
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,000
And the other is destroying
the enemy's military bases.

145
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,590
Carla Amatsu...

146
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,390
The resort area Gera-Alka
made in the nuclear region,

147
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,300
Dream Paradise...

148
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,470
According to information
gathered by my nation's ninja

149
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,560
There is evidence a
large amount of illegal

150
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,980
Sacred Tools were
brought to this area.

151
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,980
Once we have that evidence
and expose it to the Six Nations

152
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,740
President Madhart will no
longer be able to wage war.

153
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,070
This time, if the enemy is
going to use Sacred Tools

154
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,950
we must take it seriously.

155
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,740
If they lost a large amount
of Sacred Tools in battle

156
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,960
then they would put themselves in danger.

157
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,500
The likelihood they'd use them is zero.

158
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,330
I see...

159
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,420
However, I think to underestimate
them would mean death.

160
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,220
In any case,
of the eight generals here

161
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,890
I think we should split into offensive

162
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,310
and defensive teams.

163
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,810
You don't have to include
Petrose in the count.

164
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,600
Petrose is one of The Seven right?

165
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,190
Where are they?

166
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,650
Lord Calamaria

167
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,900
is already out fighting
of their own initiative.

168
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,490
We live in such different worlds.

169
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,660
Ms. Komari!

170
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,340
Oof!

171
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,470
Is that?

172
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,800
The 4th Corps of Gera-Alka?

173
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,010
There's the 1st Corps!
They keep popping up!

174
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,390
The city is surrounded, this isn't good.

175
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,440
Of course, they've declared war on them.

176
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,690
Okay, what will you do Mulnite Alliance?

177
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,580
You sure have done it.

178
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,970
Good day to you, Your
Majesty the Emperor of Mulnite.

179
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,510
President Madhart I presume?

180
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,600
What is your goal?
Hurry and spit it out.

181
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,020
Our goal is to conquer the Mulnite Empire.

182
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,650
Is what I'd like to say
but I'm not that devilish.

183
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,740
If you tell us the truth
about your magical cores

184
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,910
we will withdraw.

185
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,490
We have allied ourselves with
the Blue Jade Federation and the

186
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,960
Kingdom of Lapelico for
peace among the six nations.

187
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,790
Sooner or later the Enchanted Lands will agree too.

188
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,000
Even the great Mulnites cannot take on

189
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,420
four nations at once.

190
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,470
-You should surrender--
-There's no point in talking.

191
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,840
What?

192
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,180
It makes me laugh that you think
you have us cornered with that.

193
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,680
No need to bluff--

194
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,230
You're in the presidential
palace at the capital right?

195
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,940
What of it?

196
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,730
I've given you two options.

197
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,690
Petrose, bombs away.

198
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,740
Bombs? What are you saying?
You--

199
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,780
Alright gents, it's war!

200
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,580
Killing those that underestimate us

201
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,660
is the Mulnite Empire's way!

202
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,790
Come now, come now.

203
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,590
They smashed through all the magical

204
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,130
barriers in the
presidential palace.

205
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,630
Calamaria Petrose is sure amazing.

206
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,340
Very much so.

207
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,090
The Mulnite Empire

208
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,260
seems they are serious about this war.

209
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,110
Damn it! The whole city is being destroyed!

210
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,150
Let's hurry and meet with the 7th Corps.

211
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,490
Oh no! Oh no!

212
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,080
Frete?

213
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,920
You're an eyesore, so get out of my sight!

214
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,920
I can't believe it.
Why am I on the defensive team?

215
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,220
What a petulant attack.

216
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,480
Oh, not too bad.

217
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,520
As expected of one of The Seven.

218
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,650
Good day to all you idiots!

219
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,120
I am the strongest chief of
the Blue Jade Federation!

220
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,950
Her Excellency Prokheliya Ztaszewski!

221
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,660
Go forward my dear sapphires!

222
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,130
Tear those pigs to shreds,
make it a bloodbath!

223
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,380
Here they come!

224
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,800
Ah!

225
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,970
We're going to die!
I want to go home!

226
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,230
Ouch!

227
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,270
Stop screaming and take pictures!

228
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,400
Ms. Melka, that wasn't nice.

229
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,190
That smell!

230
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,450
The army of Lieutenant General
Dokkilin McKillin of the 2nd Corps

231
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,410
of the Kingdom of Lapelico, who destroy

232
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,500
all in their way with their
necks until they break!

233
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,080
What is that?

234
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,790
I'll never be able to
go to a zoo ever again!

235
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,170
Die!

236
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,270
Lady Komari, try pressing this button.

237
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,270
What is this?

238
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,900
Just try pressing it.

239
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,850
Okay.

240
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,950
What was that?

241
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,950
Landmines.

242
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,990
Why are there landmines?

243
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,370
I buried them there.

244
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,370
Our men were in the blast too!

245
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,790
A small issue.

246
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,170
Ms. Komari!

247
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,790
Sakuna!

248
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,210
Sorry for the wait.

249
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,010
With our forces that escaped

250
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,760
a large force is moving to Dream Paradise.

251
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
Let us prepare.

252
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,810
Kill Terakomari Gandesblood!

253
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,440
The rusty bastards.

254
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,060
We need to join in too!

255
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,260
Terakomari Gandesblood!

256
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,720
Lady Komari, that's an explosive.

257
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,640
Are you okay?

258
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,520
Yeah...

259
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,730
Komari, we finally meet again!

260
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,610
Nelia?

261
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,080
Where...?

262
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,620
Nelia!

263
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,420
Hey, where are we?

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,010
We should have been close to Dream Paradise.

265
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,510
But because Madhart's
idiots broke the transition gate

266
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,510
I don't know exactly where we were sent.

267
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,970
Don't be so alarmed, Komari.

268
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,850
I'd like you to hear me out.

269
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,680
Hear you out?

270
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,850
You two really are alike.

271
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,770
Just like my teacher.

272
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,359
Your teacher?

273
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,400
Who are they?

274
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,650
Your mother.

275
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:09,990
Huh?

276
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,910
My teacher taught me so many things.

277
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,200
How to care for others and how to fight.

278
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,420
Mother...

279
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,290
You said you don't remember, Komari

280
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,800
but I remember.

281
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,090
The social part of the Mulnite Empire
and Alka Kingdom.

282
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,760
I met you there.

283
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,060
That's when I changed.

284
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,230
Your mom is amazing Komari.

285
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,110
She's a great general
famous across the Six Nations.

286
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,910
Is she really amazing?

287
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,070
I'm not so sure.

288
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,910
She is!

289
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,580
You're going to be
general too right Komari?

290
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,790
No...

291
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,380
I don't really like fighting.

292
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,170
But you can't conquer
the world if you don't fight?

293
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,340
Conquer the world?

294
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,510
No, you can conquer
the world without fighting.

295
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,890
How?

296
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,270
If everyone becomes
friends there will be peace.

297
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,060
That's kind of conquering the world right?

298
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,480
That's why I want to
become friends with you.

299
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,740
Really?

300
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,490
But, do you not...

301
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,280
like me or something?

302
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,910
No, not at all.

303
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,120
I like you.

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,910
Oh, that's great.

305
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,500
I feel like I can really
be friends with you.

306
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,880
Yeah, me too!

307
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,380
Ouch!

308
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,300
Oh?

309
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,930
Hey, what are you doing?

310
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,430
Your Highness Nelia.

311
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,270
Don't get too comfortable
with vampires and the like.

312
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,270
Get comfortable?
I was just--

313
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,400
I am asking you to be aware
that you are the best of the best.

314
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,240
That's...

315
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,070
This is a party to make friends isn't it?

316
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,370
You're already here so why
shouldn't we be comfortable?

317
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,830
It is all about moderation.

318
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,960
There's always been a
rift between the two sides.

319
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,540
You're the one who made
the rift, right old man?

320
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,710
Hm?

321
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,800
Let's be friends old man.

322
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,470
I'll give you my pudding
if you aren't having fun.

323
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,850
Pudding?

324
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,610
I remember!

325
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,240
You're the one I ate pudding with.

326
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,410
A short time after that

327
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,240
I lost contact with my teacher.

328
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,040
A coup d'etat happened in The Alka Kingdom

329
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,630
And Madhart who used to be a general
became the president.

330
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,090
And now they are

331
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,300
trying to capture the opposition one by one

332
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,300
and start a war involving all six nations.

333
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,300
I am no longer part of a royal family, however

334
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,100
I am so close.

335
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,520
I will expose Madhart's wrongdoings
and transform Alka.

336
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,940
I will become president!

337
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,520
President?

338
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,280
To do that I need your power.

339
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,490
Komari.

340
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,780
Come conquer the world with me.

341
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,410
Please do not let her
fool you Lady Komari.

342
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,290
Vill...

343
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,960
Nelia is a student of my mother's.

344
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,080
Lady Komari.

345
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,540
I think it's okay to trust her.

346
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,090
For once, will you please follow me?

347
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,800
As you wish.

348
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,970
If you say so Lady Komari.

349
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,050
-Nelia, I accept your--
-Thank you!

350
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,520
Eh?

351
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,270
Nooooo!

352
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,270
Lady Komari!

353
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,740
That's the way we greet friends in Alka.

354
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,910
O-Oh I see.

355
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,910
Cultural differences right?

356
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,540
Lady Nelia, we don't
greet each other like that in Alka?

357
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,960
Refrain from touching Lady Komari!

358
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,830
You'll tarnish her.

359
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,090
You're too rough!

360
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,290
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,550
By the way, shall I
try the Alka greeting as well?

362
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,380
You don't need to greet me!

363
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,390
It really is fun being with you Komari!

364
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,270
An Alka and Mulnite alliance
to destroy Gera-Alka.

365
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,140
Will you all take this opportunity
to become my servants?

366
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,100
You know they'd never!

367
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,650
Huh?

368
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,270
Where am I?

369
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,990
What was I doing?

370
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,530
I can't remember.

371
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,450
So Nelia stabbed us in the back?

372
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,000
Lord Leinsworth, shall we enter the fort?

373
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,580
No, we will go after
Terakomari Gandesblood.

374
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,750
Nelia, be doomed and despair at your fate!

375
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,390
That's when you will become mine!

376
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,060
The Paradise of Shattered Dreams.
