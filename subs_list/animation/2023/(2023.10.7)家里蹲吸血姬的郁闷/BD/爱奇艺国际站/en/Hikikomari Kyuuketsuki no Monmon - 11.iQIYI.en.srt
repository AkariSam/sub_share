1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,140
Whoa!

2
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,030
Frête Mascarella!

3
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,240
Let us meet again on the battlefield!

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,870
Lady Karen...

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,090
We've somehow made it through.

6
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,880
An imperial command from Her Majesty.

7
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,890
We are to search for Terakomari

8
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,890
on the way to Dream Paradise.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,310
I'm worried for Ms. Komari.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,060
-Let us depart quickly Sir Delphyne--
-Wait!

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,600
Do you know where Terakomari is?

12
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,650
Yes!

13
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,860
I've attached a transmitter to Ms. Komari!

14
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,450
You're very well prepared.

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,870
I normally have one attached to her.

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,370
I see...

17
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, let's get our situation straight.

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,630
We've arrived at the
borders of Dream Paradise.

19
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,300
Honestly speaking,

20
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,970
it's a pure stroke of luck we haven't
been attacked by enemies yet.

21
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,380
Lady Nelia

22
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,890
What should we do when
we arrive at Dream Paradise?

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,850
We'll of course expose their secrets.

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,850
The darkness of Gera-Alka
is concentrated there.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,729
What kind of 〝darkness?〞

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,860
Madhart is imprisoning
supporters of the Alka royal family

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,690
and conducting outrageous
human experiments on them.

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,450
Hey Vill!

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,910
Can I get whatever I want?

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Human experimentation?

31
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,090
I've conducted
reconnaissance multiple times...

32
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,840
And I heard it.

33
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,390
The cries of people coming
from below Dream Paradise.

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,980
There are also rumors of sacred
articles being gathered there.

35
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,980
I remember hearing that in rare cases,
those who have been hurt by a sacred tool

36
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,150
may have their spirit evolve and
acquire a 〝Rekkaku Liberation.〞

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,950
They gain the power to pierce the earth
and move the stars just be activating it.

38
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,660
A Rekkaku Liberation.

39
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,370
That sounds like something Madhart would
think up trying to dominate the world.

40
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,750
Mushroom omelet rice is good,
but the patty version is tempting too.

41
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,380
In any case

42
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,420
We can't let Madhart get away with this.

43
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,880
We will expose
the secrets of Dream Paradise--

44
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,760
I've decided!

45
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,010
I'll order the mushroom omelet rice
and seafood omelet rice!

46
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,560
Hey Komari, did you hear a word I said?

47
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,900
Oh, sorry I was concentrated
on the omelet rice.

48
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,730
You sure are honest!

49
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,480
I do love that about you!

50
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,240
At least you were listening Carla!
You were, right?

51
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,659
You nincompoop!

52
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,780
Wh-What was that for?

53
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,030
Is it morning already?

54
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,450
Sorry guys, but I've gotta order.

55
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,909
It's still night!
Were you listening at all?

56
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
We're done for.

57
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,840
Hm...

58
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,300
That was a petulant thing to do.

59
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,090
Can you hear me, Rainsworth?

60
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,470
Mr. President, are you unharmed?

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,760
No problems here.

62
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,100
More importantly I have an order for you.

63
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,230
I want you to continue the
pursuit of Nelia Cunningham

64
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,980
and Terakomari Gandesblood.

65
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,020
Yes sir!

66
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,860
Along with that, I have a favor to ask.

67
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,610
I want you to activate the 〝Paradise Corps.〞

68
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,500
After they've gathered at Dream Paradise
they will be under your command.

69
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,210
You've got a lot of spunk
for having just woken up!

70
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,430
What are we going to do?
How do they know where we are?

71
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,560
It is odd they were able
to find us so quickly.

72
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,770
It's all over now Nelia!

73
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,270
You've betrayed your country
and now there isn't a soul

74
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,900
who would stand by your side!

75
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,490
Lady Nelia!

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,860
We need to retreat!

77
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,290
What is this?

78
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,790
It's the vampire maid's poison gas
that only kills men.

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,250
Lady Nelia now's our chance!

80
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,210
Yes!

81
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,010
Okay, it's time we go Lady Komari.
Let's follow Lord Cunningham.

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,640
Wait a second, we
can't leave Carla behind.

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,310
She's dead we have to leave her.

84
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,980
Are you sure she's dead?

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Vill!

86
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,909
There's no way you inferior species
can compete with the Jiu Liu!

87
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,740
Once we gain control of Mulnite

88
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,620
every single vampire will
be the slaves of the Jiu Liu!

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,210
I'll make you mine.

90
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,710
At least you look like
a first-class product!

91
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,170
I can show you off to
the other Eight Generals!

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,220
Shut up, you prick.

93
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,340
You are first up.

94
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,510
Stop!

95
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
What is this?

96
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,020
You bunch of rusty punks.

97
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,070
I can no longer allow you free reign.

98
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,490
Delphyne!

99
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
Die!

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,909
You maggot!

101
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,460
Boom, boom chika boom...

102
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,750
Oh yeah!

103
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,790
Oh, oh yeah!

104
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,130
Your Excellency! Are you unharmed?

105
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,010
Guys!

106
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,260
Ms. Komari are you okay?

107
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,010
Sakuna?
Why are you here?

108
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,220
I hurried to come find you!

109
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,220
Delphyne and I are in the offense group!

110
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,310
Thank you!

111
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,560
Um, Ms. Komari...

112
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,270
-Sakunaaa!
-Lady Komari...

113
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,570
Isn't there something that
you would like to say to me?

114
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,780
That's right! Vill, is your leg okay?

115
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,240
It's okay, I was healed by the magic core.

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,490
More importantly

117
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,240
Don't you think you should
reward your maid with a hug as well?

118
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,580
I-I guess I have to...

119
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,130
Ms. Komari I don't think
this is the time for that.

120
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,420
That's right!

121
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,800
You have somewhere you
need to be, right Ms. Komari?

122
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,929
Please leave this to us and go on ahead.

123
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,309
I've always wanted to
say that at least once!

124
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,230
Isn't that what the person
who dies always says?

125
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,020
Let's go Lady Komari.

126
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,140
Okay.

127
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,860
That's right.

128
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,530
I have to go along with Nelia.

129
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,110
The resort area where
Gera-Alka's darkness swirls.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,910
To Dream Paradise!

131
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,840
It's barbaric!

132
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,710
There is no need for a futile war!

133
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,590
Step down Madhart!

134
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,470
Give us back our
Kingdom that lived in peace!

135
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,930
It's spectacular!

136
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,100
This could really be the moment
we get to see Gera-Alka's demise!

137
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,230
Um, Ms. Melka...

138
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,940
Why are we here in Gera-Alka?

139
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,770
This isn't what our Mulnite
news branch normally does.

140
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,280
We're here of course to get the scoop
that will plunge the world into chaos!

141
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,450
That's impossible.

142
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,240
The Six Nation's Newspaper is
treated by people as fake news.

143
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,490
Don't you worry.

144
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,450
The truth will be reflected in the lens!

145
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,540
The video you are taking right now

146
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,130
is real-time fact that's being
broadcast live all over the world!

147
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,920
So then!

148
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,590
Let's go get the scoop of the century
Gera-Alka is hiding!

149
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,360
They're really putting up
a fight, damn vampires.

150
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,030
What is Nelia Cunningham doing?

151
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,360
She will soon arrive at Dream Paradise.

152
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,450
I'll be there soon.

153
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,370
I won't let you go to Ms. Komari...

154
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,460
There is no hope for you all.

155
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,750
Gandesblood will soon be killed.

156
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,260
Abercrombie's unit is
waiting for her at Dream Paradise.

157
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,220
Abercrombie?

158
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,220
I remember that name.

159
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,140
Huh?

160
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,270
She was really strong.

161
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,390
What are you saying?

162
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,480
In the end...

163
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,610
I beat her.

164
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,110
Hey, what is this?

165
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,780
Abercrombie?

166
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,080
This must be the work of Lord Memoir.

167
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,660
Sakuna came here?

168
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,460
No...

169
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,290
Lord Memoir has been waging wars
at the behest of The Empress.

170
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,090
That's when she killed Abercrombie

171
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,800
and by using her Rekkaku
Liberation, Asterism Rotation

172
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,600
she became able to
take control of her at any time.

173
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,060
Then she made her fight her troops
as they all waited to ambush us.

174
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,560
That's brutal.

175
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,650
Anyway, this is our lucky day.

176
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,400
We can enter Dream Paradise
without a fight at all!

177
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,200
There's someone here.

178
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,410
So this is Madhart's Dream Paradise?

179
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,090
Restraints and bloody sacred articles...

180
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,380
It seems they were conducting
human experiments here

181
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,300
using sacred articles.

182
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,260
At any rate, let's find the keys.

183
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,600
We have to save them.

184
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,720
Lady Nelia!

185
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,930
The keys are right here.

186
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Oh?

187
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,020
How'd you find those?

188
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,810
They were on the ground at the entrance.

189
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,980
That's great!

190
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,730
We can save them with this!

191
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,650
Do you think we need to save them?

192
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,990
What are you saying? Of course!

193
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,990
Anyway, pass the key--

194
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,530
They are fools who defied the President.

195
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,700
Huh?

196
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,700
Besides, these keys

197
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,000
are for imprisoning you Lady Nelia.

198
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,470
My name is Gertrude.

199
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,020
Captain of the Eighth corps.

200
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,520
Gertrude Rainsworth.

201
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,610
Nelia!

202
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,610
Lady Komari!

203
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,280
Vill!

204
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,960
How unfortunate Nelia!

205
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,550
Rainsworth!

206
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,380
What is going on?
Is this...

207
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,720
She's my little sister.

208
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,260
She's been watching you this whole time.

209
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,220
It can't be.

210
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,810
You are my friend!

211
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,690
Aren't you Gertrude?

212
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,560
Yes, I am your friend Lady Nelia.

213
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,230
You aren't though, are you Gertrude?

214
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,530
Oh, I misspoke.

215
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,990
I am Lady Nelia's friend...

216
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,160
But right now I'm her enemy.

217
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,790
Gertrude...

218
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,120
Why?

219
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,790
As I stood by your side
watching I thought...

220
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,920
The people around you
always spoke behind your back.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,590
No matter how hard you
tried you were never rewarded.

222
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,840
Every day spent just
shuddering with frustration.

223
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,680
If this continues on you will
eventually break, Lady Nelia.

224
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,310
That's why I think you should give up on
your impossible ambitions of peace.

225
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,020
President Madhart is
trying to create world peace.

226
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,820
It's the same exact thing that you want.

227
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,030
No it's not!

228
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,860
I know there's another way!

229
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,990
That's right.

230
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,080
My teacher said that if everyone

231
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,250
cared for others the
world would be at peace.

232
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,590
There's no need for
such difficult thoughts.

233
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,710
I will free you from all of your pain.

234
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,550
Throw away your intangible dreams

235
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,300
and become mine.

236
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,060
This isn't the end of Nelia's dreams!

237
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,560
Huh?

238
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,900
You won't let
a bunch of idiots like you ruin them!

239
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,440
Insolent child...

240
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,950
You say the funniest things.

241
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,110
Who are you calling an idiot, huh?

242
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,530
I'm calling YOU an idiot!

243
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,240
My mother always said

244
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,290
those who only treat others as tools
have no future!

245
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,040
Nelia is strong!

246
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,960
She would never give in to you!

247
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,170
Now say sorry to Nelia and get lost!

248
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,460
You misunderstanding bastard!

249
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,300
You...

250
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,180
insolent brat!

251
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,260
Come on!
You...

252
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,060
inferior vampire!

253
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,810
What happened...
to all your big talk?

254
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,980
Where did it go?

255
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,490
What are you doing?

256
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,240
You...

257
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,700
You survived?

258
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,920
Ms. Komari is hurt isn't she?

259
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,210
Who did this?

260
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,750
Was it you over the Jiu-Liu?
You weren't satisfied with just us,

261
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,510
so you hurt Ms. Komari as well?

262
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,300
Brother! There are
more than this Blue Jade wannabe!

263
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,640
We're under attack!

264
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,600
Sakuna Memoir!

265
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,310
What have you done?

266
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,980
It seems we all got here
chasing down Ms. Komari.

267
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,360
Carla Amatsu and
the newspaper journalists.

268
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,530
We can no longer let you do as you like!

269
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,080
I will take on
this Blue Jade wannabe and Carla Amatsu.

270
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,710
You go and command
the Rakuen Corps brother!

271
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,380
Okay.

272
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,340
The Paradise Corps?

273
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,180
An elite force of 5,000 men,
secretly formed by President Madhart.

274
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,510
Fort Fall is as good as fallen.

275
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,310
Nelia, wait quietly for me until I return.

276
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,150
Comet Dust Tail!

277
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,819
Jiu-Liu Droplets!

278
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,569
I'm impressed you found this place.

279
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,030
Actually...

280
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,040
How did you get in
here in the first place?

281
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,750
That doesn't matter.

282
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,000
I have come all the way here
to advise you to surrender.

283
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,970
There is no future for
Mulnite and Divine Paradise.

284
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,470
You will do what I ask of you.

285
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,430
Tell you where the magic cores are?

286
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,730
Don't make me repeat myself.
There's no way I'd tell you.

287
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,600
That makes me sad, Empress.

288
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,820
In the end, vampires
are just a lesser race.

289
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,610
There is no way you are a match
for the mighty Jiu-Liu led by me.

290
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
The Jiu-Liu are mighty?

291
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,160
For being that mighty
you seem to be losing a lot.

292
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,330
We have a special
hidden ace up our sleeve.

293
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,790
Each one with the
power befit of a general.

294
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,800
5,000 elite soldiers.

295
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,510
The Paradise Corps.

296
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,520
N-Nelia...

297
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,230
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,440
Could you lend me your shoulder?

299
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,660
What would you do with my shoulder?

300
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,200
Go after Rainsworth.

301
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,040
At this rate everyone is in danger.

302
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,790
Why?

303
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,380
Why are you able to not
give up in a situation like this?

304
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,250
I don't want to keep trying.

305
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,260
But I have to.

306
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,050
It hurts...

307
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,090
And it is hard...

308
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,100
but I am one of the Crimson Generals.

309
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,690
I cannot give up.

310
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,310
It's impossible.

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,560
We're against 5,000 elite soldiers.

312
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,780
We won't know if we can win or not

313
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,900
until we give it a try.

314
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,860
That's right, but...

315
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,030
I just can't do it.

316
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,580
I've been degraded by so many people

317
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,700
without producing any results.

318
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,420
I've realized my ideals
are simply a bunch of hollow wishes.

319
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,960
What do you mean hollow?

320
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,930
At first I thought you were a fool.

321
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,850
Only a crazy person
would suddenly

322
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,010
invite someone to
conquer the world.

323
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,310
But after meeting you
again and talking to you...

324
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,140
The way I saw you changed.

325
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,940
It might partially be because
you were my mother's student.

326
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,690
But I really liked the way that you think.

327
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,950
It's just a beautiful wish.

328
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,450
A world where everyone
lives for one another.

329
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,370
But, I still like it.

330
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,540
The stuff you talk about.

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,290
Even if you say you like it,

332
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,710
there's no meaning if
I can't make it a reality.

333
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,760
It's up to you to decide if
your ideals are hollow wishes.

334
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,720
I love your beautiful heart!

335
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,770
Suck my blood.

336
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,350
Eh?

337
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,940
I heard that vampires give each
other blood as a sign of trust.

338
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,360
If you're worried about not
being accepted by anyone,

339
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,160
I'll accept you.

340
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,660
I've never done anything
like this for anyone before.

341
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,870
But you are a kindred spirit Nelia!

342
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,000
If it's with you I think we
can aim to take on the world!

343
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,380
So hurry up and drink!

344
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,920
S-Sorry, I got a little worked up.

345
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,300
Blood is pretty gross isn't it.

346
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,010
No...

347
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,850
I will accept your trust.

348
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,840
I have four children.

349
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,090
But the third one is
the real troublemaker.

350
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,130
She's just a mess.

351
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,550
But I think one day

352
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,390
that kid will become
someone to lead Mulnite.

353
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,480
No, not just Mulnite...

354
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,270
She just might make the world
a more fun and interesting place.

355
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,820
Sword Flower of Extermination!

356
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,830
Nelia?

357
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,790
Thank you Komari!

358
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,910
I think I'm onto something.

359
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,080
First, we must achieve our original goal.

360
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,590
