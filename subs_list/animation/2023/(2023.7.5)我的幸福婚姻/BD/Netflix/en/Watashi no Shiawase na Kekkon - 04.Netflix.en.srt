1
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,676
Mo... ther.

2
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:15,764
Wait.

3
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,685
Please wait, Shinichi.
You have it wrong.

4
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:22,438
What am I wrong about, Sumi?

5
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,772
About Miyo...

6
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,190
No supernatural abilities.

7
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:28,152
She's not showing
any signs of them at all.

8
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:31,071
Please don't give up on Miyo.

9
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,616
If we were a mediocre family without
supernatural abilities,

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,077
perhaps I could have loved Miyo.

11
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,417
I'm sorry, Miyo.

12
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:49,590
{\an8}Since I don't have much time left,
I will not be able to protect you.

13
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:53,052
{\an8}But I have no doubt you'll be all right.

14
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:56,638
{\an8}Once you grow up a little bit more, then...

15
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:03,437
Mother...

16
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:25,542
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

17
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:48,959
EPISODE 4
THE GIFT

18
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,131
Ms. Yurie.

19
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,676
Is anything the matter, Ms. Miyo?

20
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,014
Um, may I ask you something, Ms. Yurie?

21
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:03,473
Certainly.

22
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:07,227
Actually, I wanted to give a gift

23
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:09,730
to my husband-to-be.

24
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,481
Oh my!

25
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,777
Um, shouldn't I do the dishes?

26
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:18,363
Don't worry about that now.

27
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:21,742
{\an8}It's more important to think about
what to give to the Young Master.

28
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,661
I only have a very small budget.

29
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:28,874
I don't know if I can buy
a gift he would like.

30
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:33,921
You won't need to buy anything expensive
if you can make him something by hand.

31
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:34,963
Something by hand?

32
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:35,881
Yes.

33
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:40,385
<i>How about something he uses daily?</i>

34
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,016
He would surely love anything
you make by hand, Ms. Miyo.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,477
Do you... think so?

36
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,895
Yes.

37
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:52,356
Me making something by hand...

38
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,115
That's a nice <i>kumihimo</i> cord.

39
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,909
It's pretty.

40
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:12,417
I think... I'd like to make this.

41
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,046
Um, sir?

42
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,172
What is it?

43
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:21,677
Would it be alright if I went out
for a while today?

44
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,011
Why?

45
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,806
Well, there's something I want to buy.

46
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,849
Are you going alone?

47
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,018
No, with Ms. Yurie.

48
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:33,021
I could accompany you on another day.

49
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,066
No, there's no need for that.

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,026
I see.

51
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,487
Be careful when you go out.

52
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:44,074
Don't follow strangers.

53
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:45,826
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,328
Also,

55
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:50,789
take this with you when you go out.

56
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,792
What's this?

57
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,918
It's an amulet.

58
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,337
Oh, thank you very much.

59
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:00,090
You must keep it with you
at all times, understood?

60
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:01,466
Y-Yes, sir.

61
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,468
Do you really understand?

62
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,595
O-Of course I do.

63
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,851
I'm going now.

64
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,185
Have a nice day.

65
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:17,232
<i>He gave me an amulet just for going out.</i>

66
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,984
<i>He's being overprotective.</i>

67
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,240
Mr. Koji.

68
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,242
Ms. Kaya has arrived.

69
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:31,246
If you show up with
a disgruntled expression like that,

70
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,373
your fiancée will become upset.

71
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,751
Big brother! What are you doing here?

72
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,797
It must be hard
sucking up to Kaya Saimori.

73
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm not enjoying it.

74
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:47,012
I'm impressed as always, Koji,
with you being dutiful and obedient.

75
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:51,016
This is what I have to endure
because you're always playing around.

76
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,770
Why don't you stop goofing off
and act more like the eldest--

77
00:05:59,232 --> 00:06:02,527
You're too kind, which makes you unkind.

78
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,912
What the hell...

79
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,417
Wow!

80
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,295
There's so many to choose from.

81
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:27,928
<i>I wonder what color will look good on him?</i>

82
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,941
{\an8}This might suit him.

83
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,153
Thank you very much.

84
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:48,698
I'm glad you found a good color.

85
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:52,828
Yes. I'm looking forward to braiding it.

86
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,374
Oh, I just remembered.

87
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,627
We are out of salt.

88
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,295
Should I go buy some?

89
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,966
No, no. It's my job to buy salt.

90
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:09,636
Please wait for me here, Ms. Miyo.

91
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,482
Oh! Isn't that Big Sister?

92
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,990
Kaya...

93
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:33,493
It's been a long time, Big Sister Miyo.

94
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:41,501
We've been waiting for you,

95
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,295
Mr. Kudo.

96
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:48,758
Thank you for welcoming me
on such short notice.

97
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:54,264
We're honored that you came here
in spite of your busy schedule.

98
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,810
So, what brings you here today?

99
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,189
It's about your daughter, Miyo.

100
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:05,150
Miyo? What about Miyo?

101
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,236
I'm planning to officially get engaged

102
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,780
and marry her in the future.

103
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,659
I... see.

104
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:16,077
Therefore,

105
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:21,791
I feel that we should make clear
the relationship between our families.

106
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,419
What do you mean by relationship?

107
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:31,510
Ordinarily, marriages of our kind are
established according to mutual interests.

108
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,428
However,

109
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:38,934
I feel hesitant to giving anything
to your family with this marriage.

110
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,310
What are you...

111
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:42,437
Don't you realize?

112
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,232
I know what you did to Miyo.

113
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,817
<i>I know practically all of it.</i>

114
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:53,573
How surprising that you're still alive,
Big Sister.

115
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,951
Oh, but...

116
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,247
since you're still wearing
those undignified clothes,

117
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,958
Mr. Kudo must have abandoned you.

118
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,836
Poor Big Sister.

119
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:11,591
I... I wasn't...

120
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,511
Stop it, Kaya.

121
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:15,470
Well,

122
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,430
{\an8}I guess it couldn't be helped.

123
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:21,726
{\an8}There's no way a good-for-nothing like you
would be matched with someone like him.

124
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,022
It's only natural
you were thrown out of the house.

125
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,609
You should feel lucky you're still alive.

126
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:32,571
That's enough. Let's go, Kaya.

127
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:34,739
Keep quiet, Koji.

128
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:40,287
{\an8}You experienced things that made you
wish you were dead, didn't you?

129
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,748
{\an8}Although I can't even imagine
what that was like.

130
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:48,003
I will pay you the betrothal money,
but only under one condition.

131
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:52,257
{\an8}Give Miyo an earnest apology,
face to face.

132
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,676
Apologize?

133
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,220
I won't force you if you don't want to.

134
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,515
We'll just cut ties with you in that case.

135
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,644
If you need money, just ask.

136
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:10,150
{\an8}If you get down on your knees and beg,
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,405
You're being silent like that...
It takes me back.

138
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:18,867
{\an8}Wherever you go,
you never change, Big Sister.

139
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,204
{\an8}I... I'm very... sorry--

140
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,664
{\an8}Ms. Miyo.

141
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,583
Pardon me for keeping you waiting.

142
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,919
Are they acquaintances of yours?

143
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:31,671
Hello.

144
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:35,008
My name is Kaya Saimori.

145
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,260
I appreciate you helping my big sister.

146
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:41,181
Are you one of her fellow workers?

147
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:46,394
I couldn't possibly be
a fellow worker of Ms. Miyo.

148
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:51,232
Ms. Miyo is the future wife
of Mr. Kiyoka Kudo.

149
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:54,319
Future... wife?

150
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,570
{\an8}Yes.

151
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:59,282
{\an8}Excuse me for not introducing myself.
My name is Yurie.

152
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,452
{\an8}I work as a maid for Ms. Miyo.

153
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:10,293
Oh my goodness. Mr. Kudo is a kind man,
or a rare kind of man.

154
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:13,588
I was convinced that he had let her go.

155
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:17,050
Rumors are not reliable, are they?

156
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:21,221
{\an8}Well then, if you would excuse us,

157
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:22,764
{\an8}we have other errands to do.

158
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,433
{\an8}Let's go home, Ms. Miyo.

159
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,566
<i>An apology...</i>

160
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,569
Can you give us
a little time to think about it?

161
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,571
Understood.

162
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,199
But I won't wait too long.

163
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,285
Ms. Miyo,

164
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,288
I'll prepare some tea presently.

165
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,625
No thank you, I'm fine.

166
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,419
Ms. Miyo?

167
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:56,339
Thank you for coming with me today.

168
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:00,009
You should rest now too, Ms. Yurie.

169
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:08,852
<i>I hate it...</i>

170
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:12,772
<i>I hate myself for being this way.</i>

171
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,446
How could he be satisfied
with a wife like her?

172
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,948
I think Mr. Kudo is very strange.

173
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:27,704
<i>Did we have company?</i>

174
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:37,672
<i>What a beautiful man.</i>

175
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:42,635
I'm home.

176
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,931
Welcome home, sir.

177
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:49,434
What's the matter?

178
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:50,393
Nothing.

179
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,271
Nothing in particular.

180
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,533
When meeting her sister
from the Saimori family,

181
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,703
Ms. Miyo looked very distressed.

182
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:13,458
<i>She's just been moping since we came home.</i>

183
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:18,338
I'm sorry this happened on my watch.

184
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:20,590
I see.

185
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,766
It's me. Can I talk to you for a minute?

186
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:34,229
Just remember this one thing.

187
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:39,859
What's worrying you now
is not going to matter after a while.

188
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,904
So don't take it so seriously.

189
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:46,366
If there's anything you want to say to me,

190
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:47,867
I'm always here to listen.

191
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:55,208
I'm... very sorry, sir.

192
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:05,885
<i>What can I do to give her some confidence?</i>

193
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:10,139
<i>The answer is simple, Young Master.</i>

194
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:13,184
<i>A woman builds confidence by being loved.</i>

195
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:14,936
<i>Being loved...</i>

196
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,022
<i>It's not that difficult.</i>

197
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:25,321
<i>All you have to do is express to her
just how much you care about her.</i>

198
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:30,577
<i>If you engage with her sincerely
with all your heart,</i>

199
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,246
<i>she will certainly understand
how you feel.</i>

200
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,920
<i>I'm done braiding the</i> kumihimo <i>cord,</i>

201
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:45,675
<i>but I could never give it to him now.</i>

202
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,261
Ms. Miyo.

203
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,597
May I open the door?

204
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,682
Yes. Come in.

205
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:55,643
You have company.

206
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:07,947
It's really been a long time, Ms. Miyo.

207
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,241
{\an8}Hana!

208
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:16,080
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

209
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,874
You too, Hana.

210
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:20,335
I'm so happy to see you're well.

211
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,879
I got married.

212
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,591
And I have a child now.

213
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:29,969
I live a modest, happy life.

214
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:33,806
That's wonderful.

215
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:42,523
For a long time, I've wanted to
see you happy and smiling.

216
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,111
From that day...

217
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:52,784
{\an8}<i>when I was forbidden to be beside you,
I lived at my family home.</i>

218
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:02,210
Are you happy now, Ms. Miyo?

219
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,214
I don't deserve it...

220
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:08,216
{\an8}Because...

221
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,802
{\an8}I don't have supernatural abilities.

222
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:13,596
{\an8}Not even Spirit-Sight.

223
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:18,810
So I don't deserve to be his wife...

224
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:23,731
I don't deserve to be happy!

225
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:29,237
Do you know how I was brought
here to meet you?

226
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:37,078
The first time I received a letter
from him, I was very surprised.

227
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,622
To me, he lives in another world.

228
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,624
Ms. Miyo,

229
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,752
Mr. Kudo is a good man, isn't he?

230
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,964
TO HANA KANAO

231
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:48,923
{\an8}KIYOKA KUDO

232
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,216
{\an8}Sir?

233
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,468
Why?

234
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:56,514
Did he already know everything?

235
00:16:57,473 --> 00:17:02,603
<i>I thought I wasn't worthy because
I don't have supernatural abilities,</i>

236
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,356
<i>unlike Kaya.</i>

237
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:11,362
<i>I was scared to lose my happiness
by revealing this fact to him.</i>

238
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,909
<i>I was sure that if he found out the truth,
I would be abandoned.</i>

239
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,829
<i>I thought my happiness would disappear.</i>

240
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:25,710
I... I was stuck with my assumptions.

241
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:31,883
Ms. Miyo,
Mr. Kudo wrote me a letter to help you

242
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,677
while fully aware of your situation.

243
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:39,807
So all you have to do
is have a little bit of courage.

244
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:42,935
{\an8}It's all right. I know you are capable.

245
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:46,064
{\an8}Thank you, Hana.

246
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:49,984
I'll try... I'll give it my best.

247
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:57,450
Sir.

248
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:02,455
What is it, so suddenly?

249
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:03,414
Sir.

250
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:09,837
There's something I...
couldn't tell you this whole time.

251
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,216
I don't have...

252
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,842
supernatural abilities.

253
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:18,262
I don't have Spirit-Sight.

254
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,975
At home, I was working as a servant.

255
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:27,355
I'm not capable of doing what a girl
from a noble family is expected to do.

256
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,733
I purposely kept this fact from you

257
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,944
{\an8}because of my shame.

258
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:37,448
{\an8}If you tell me to die, I'll die.

259
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:40,118
{\an8}If you tell me to leave here, I'll leave.

260
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:42,203
{\an8}I'll do so right away.

261
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:50,586
{\an8}I wanted to thank you for
going into town with me, giving me a comb,

262
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:54,132
{\an8}and so many other things I'm grateful for.

263
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,886
{\an8}I made this myself
to express my gratitude.

264
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,599
{\an8}I don't mind if you discard
or burn it if you don't need it.

265
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:10,523
Now I've told you everything
that I needed to say.

266
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:13,901
Will you please tell me
your decision, sir?

267
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,908
How long are you going to do that?

268
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:27,665
I need you to stay with me,

269
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,962
because soon,
we're going to get formally engaged.

270
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,717
Don't you want to
keep living here with me?

271
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:39,677
I...

272
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,681
{\an8}I do... I want to stay here,

273
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,976
{\an8}with your permission, sir.

274
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,686
{\an8}Permission?

275
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:53,191
{\an8}I'm the one who wants you to be here.

276
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:55,401
{\an8}Nobody but me.

277
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:03,201
S-Sir.

278
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:05,703
Sorry.

279
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,289
It's all right.

280
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,213
It's a beautiful color.

281
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:19,425
Miyo, would you tie my hair with this?

282
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:20,801
Yes.

283
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:31,229
It's done.

284
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:36,734
Thank you. I'll use it with care.

285
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,241
Hana.

286
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:46,077
Thank you so, so much.

287
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,996
If I hadn't met you...

288
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,290
If you hadn't said those words to me...

289
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,126
I would still be sitting alone in my room.

290
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,382
I'm honored to have been of help.
I'm glad we could talk, too.

291
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,175
Goodbye.

292
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:04,428
Godo, take good care of her.

293
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:05,638
Yes, sir.

294
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:07,265
Mr. Kudo.

295
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:09,642
Thank you very much for inviting me today.

296
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:12,645
Ms. Miyo, I wish you much happiness.

297
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,823
Don't worry.

298
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:25,825
You'll be able to see her any time.

299
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:27,326
Sir.

300
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,412
Thank you very much.

301
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:30,496
Don't mention it.

302
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,393
{\an8}Miyo is getting along well with Kudo?

303
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:57,398
We must do something fast
in order to make her ours.

304
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,984
But what?

305
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:03,404
{\an8}I know.

306
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:05,948
That girl is the answer.

307
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,493
<i>She'll dance for us
like a puppet on a string.</i>

308
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,918
