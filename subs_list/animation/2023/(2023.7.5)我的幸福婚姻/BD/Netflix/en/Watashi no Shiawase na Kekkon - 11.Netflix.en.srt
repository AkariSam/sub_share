00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:12,469
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

2
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:35,928
EPISODE 11
MY MOTHER'S LEGACY

3
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:38,972
I'll tell you everything.

4
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:42,726
I'll tell you why Sumi married into
the Saimori family,

5
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:46,313
and why she sealed off
your supernatural ability.

6
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,944
<i>It was a few years before you were born.</i>

7
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:57,282
<i>Tsuruki Trading failed in negotiations
with a certain leading client</i>

8
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:01,036
<i>and were performing poorly.</i>

9
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:05,958
<i>Since we were backed by Tsuruki Trading,</i>

10
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,586
<i>we had a heavy debt load
and were facing a predicament.</i>

11
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:11,964
<i>That is when...</i>

12
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:15,968
<i>the marriage proposal was brought to us.</i>

13
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:20,973
<i>They had heard from somewhere
that the Usuba family was in crisis.</i>

14
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,226
<i>They said they would pay off
our huge debts</i>

15
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:27,312
<i>if Sumi married their son.</i>

16
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:31,984
<i>They were persistent,
sending offers frequently.</i>

17
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,819
<i>I rejected each offer.</i>

18
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,114
<i>But one day...</i>

19
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:44,288
<i>Sumi accepted their offer on her own
without consulting me.</i>

20
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:49,167
Do you realize what you have done?

21
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:52,921
It will mean that we'll be
giving the Usuba blood to another family.

22
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:56,758
If we don't do anything at all,
it's over for the Usuba family.

23
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:01,513
Sumi! You don't understand anything.

24
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:05,726
What do you think you'll be able to do
with such a frail body?

25
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:07,895
This is the only way forward.

26
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,733
Father, I'm sorry.

27
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,028
You're such a fool, my child.

28
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:23,368
<i>The family she married into
was the Saimori family.</i>

29
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,789
<i>After the finalization
of this contract we call "marriage,"</i>

30
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:30,751
<i>they cut off our means
of communication with her.</i>

31
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,294
<i>As a result,</i>

32
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,922
<i>our family ties were broken.</i>

33
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:40,719
Miyo.

34
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:44,139
I have something I want to show you.

35
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,561
{\an8}You possess the ability of Dream-Sight.

36
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:53,607
Even Sumi didn't develop
that supernatural ability.

37
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,026
Dream-Sight?

38
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,570
Go ahead and touch that tree.

39
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,472
This woman from the Usuba family...

40
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,475
she's not very friendly.

41
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:29,893
Shinichi.

42
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,521
This is not just a political marriage.

43
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:34,648
You do understand your role,
don't you?

44
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,275
Yes.

45
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:39,278
To conceive a child with
her family's supernatural ability.

46
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:40,988
I'm counting on you, Sumi.

47
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,216
You did it!

48
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:18,900
{\an8}<i>This girl.</i>

49
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:20,902
{\an8}<i>She has the ability of Dream-Sight.</i>

50
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,458
Haven't you confirmed it yet?

51
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,419
No. Well, Miyo is still an infant.

52
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:41,757
If we don't quickly obtain
the Usuba family's supernatural abilities,

53
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,759
the Saimori family will be downgraded.

54
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,762
We went through the trouble
of getting their bloodline.

55
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,765
And there's no telling when
she'll fall ill.

56
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,185
If Miyo's no good,
she must hurry to have another child.

57
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:54,936
Yes.

58
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,697
<i>I'm sorry, Miyo.</i>

59
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:09,951
{\an8}<i>I don't have much time left.</i>

60
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,455
<i>Your supernatural ability</i>

61
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,458
<i>will be discovered when the time comes.</i>

62
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,169
<i>Then your ability of Dream-Sight</i>

63
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:22,672
<i>will be misused by this family,
and the Usuba family will...</i>

64
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:27,969
You will have to live
on your own from now on.

65
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,640
You might encounter sadness and hardships.

66
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,769
You might wonder why you don't have any
supernatural abilities.

67
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:40,982
But for now, let me seal off your ability.

68
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,601
{\an8}I'm sorry, Miyo.

69
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:28,655
You could see it, couldn't you?

70
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:31,491
At first, it may be difficult
for you to accept it.

71
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,827
It's best for you
to rest your body for now.

72
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:06,234
Damn. They just keep on coming.

73
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,070
Godo, at this rate we'll...

74
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:12,115
Don't give up so easily!
We have to withstand it somehow!

75
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,543
Commander!

76
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:24,878
All of you!

77
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:27,297
I want to commend you for holding out.

78
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,883
We won't just leave you here
and die, Commander.

79
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,093
The reconnaissance unit reports

80
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,554
most of the band of Grotesqueries
have already been exterminated.

81
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,225
Let's proceed to get rid of the rest
of them all at once!

82
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,142
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

83
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,358
Let's go!

84
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:01,665
Y-Yes...

85
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:04,501
Good morning, Miyo.

86
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,586
How are you feeling?

87
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:12,509
Your supernatural ability
is not acting up anymore, is it?

88
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,512
Even if you don't tell me,

89
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:17,764
your healthy complexion is proof.

90
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:22,936
By the way, please wear these clothes
while you are here.

91
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,730
A robe for the maiden of Dream-Sight,

92
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:28,191
handed down through generations
of the Usuba family.

93
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:34,322
As for the clothes you were wearing,
I will keep them for you, so don't worry.

94
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:44,499
<i>I was released from my nightmares,
and my body was making a recovery.</i>

95
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:49,713
<i>But as time went by
in this small birdcage,</i>

96
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:53,633
<i>my feelings for my husband-to-be
and my regrets</i>

97
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,928
<i>were getting stronger by the day.</i>

98
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:02,267
<i>I should have told him the answer
I decided long ago.</i>

99
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,188
It was completely my own fault.

100
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,239
Aren't you going to eat, Miyo?

101
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,453
You still can't forgive me?

102
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:25,165
Or do you have a problem with your room?

103
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:28,501
Maybe the food wasn't to your liking.

104
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,378
I'll get you something else right away.

105
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,338
That's not it.

106
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,468
I'm stumped. What's the matter, then?

107
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:40,180
I want you to give me back
my cherry blossom kimono.

108
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:44,684
It's my precious kimono
that my husband-to-be gave me.

109
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:47,979
I can't do that.

110
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:50,231
Is it not possible at all?

111
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:51,650
No.

112
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:55,820
I want to talk to my husband-to-be again.

113
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:56,821
Why?

114
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:00,825
Because I was wrong about everything.

115
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,828
I'm ashamed to face him.

116
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:07,332
But I think I should
apologize to him in earnest, and...

117
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,461
Do you want to leave this house?

118
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,672
We will not allow that.

119
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,218
Listen, do you know
how desperately I waited for you?

120
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:22,597
Do you know
how much happiness I'm feeling now?

121
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,474
You don't know.

122
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,770
I want to protect you.

123
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:31,648
Why?

124
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,692
Because it's my job.

125
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:37,237
Please.

126
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:41,574
All I want to do is to see him.

127
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:47,247
I want to see him and tell him
what I couldn't but I should have said.

128
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:56,172
We've been adhering most faithfully
to the code of our ancestors.

129
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:59,217
We cannot use our real family name.

130
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:02,595
We are permitted to marry
only within our kin.

131
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:06,641
We cannot have close friends
or romantic partners.

132
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,394
The Usuba family's duty

133
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:12,188
is to subjugate the out-of-control
supernatural ability possessors.

134
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:18,278
But that has never been asked of us
since I was born.

135
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:23,199
{\an8}No matter how much
we adhere to the code, it means nothing.

136
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,662
{\an8}There will never be a day when we
accomplish the duties of the Usuba family.

137
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:32,333
I want a role that is all my own.

138
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,795
When a maiden
of Dream-Sight appeared,

139
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,298
a member of the family
with supernatural abilities

140
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:42,385
was chosen to protect the maiden
with their life, it is said.

141
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:46,556
In the present day, that would be my role.

142
00:12:47,348 --> 00:12:50,059
Presumably, doubling as your spouse.

143
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:01,946
I beg of you, Miyo.
Please stay here with us.

144
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:05,325
I want to protect you.

145
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:10,121
I don't want to cede this mission
to anyone else.

146
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,339
<i>I thought...</i>

147
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:22,258
<i>you were the same as me.</i>

148
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:28,223
<i>Someone who had lost the purpose to live
and was feeling hollow, like me.</i>

149
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,603
Miyo.

150
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,242
We did it!

151
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:49,702
We defeated the band of Grotesqueries!

152
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,246
Victory is ours!

153
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:57,126
Godo. Turn the battle formation
back to the initial position.

154
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,003
We'll regroup the search unit.

155
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,046
Yes, sir!

156
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:06,261
Huh?

157
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:17,522
Godo!

158
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,211
{\an8}- Commander!
- Commander!

159
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,929
{\an8}How do you like living here?

160
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,057
{\an8}Are you experiencing any inconvenience?

161
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,101
{\an8}No, not particularly.

162
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:01,107
Um, is it utterly impossible
for me to see my husband-to-be?

163
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,193
I'm sorry,
but I just can't let you do that.

164
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:06,487
I don't mind if it's just once.

165
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:07,989
Please.

166
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,493
Your stubbornness reminds me of Sumi.

167
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:14,621
If only I hadn't...

168
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,832
been so cruel to cut her off.

169
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,002
I probably wouldn't have
lost my daughter so early,

170
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:25,965
and you, my granddaughter, wouldn't have
led such an unfortunate life.

171
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,720
For all your hardships through the years,

172
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:31,638
I apologize.

173
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:37,352
Essentially, we are a family
related by blood.

174
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:41,272
If anything happens to you,
we will come to help and support you.

175
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:44,984
From now on, I want you to rely on us
without hesitation.

176
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:50,907
I don't know what to say, being suddenly
told I'm part of your family.

177
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:55,078
{\an8}Even if you want me to,
I don't know how to rely on you.

178
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,831
{\an8}To begin with, what is a family?

179
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,418
{\an8}I don't even know that.

180
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,253
{\an8}People must think I'm strange.

181
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,507
{\an8}I angered my husband-to-be.

182
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:15,181
Um, I'm very sorry
to be telling you meaningless things.

183
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:16,891
No, it's all right.

184
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,936
I'm glad you told me
what you really think.

185
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:25,566
Just let me say something
grandfatherly to you.

186
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,819
As you said just now,

187
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:33,199
I think that sharing a burden you cannot
carry by yourself is what a family does.

188
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,201
Sharing?

189
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,873
{\an8}Relying doesn't mean
leaving everything up to another person.

190
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,127
{\an8}I think it means asking someone
to carry some of your load

191
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,422
{\an8}that you can't carry by yourself.

192
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:51,134
{\an8}It's okay to disappoint them
or anger them.

193
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:54,971
{\an8}The bond of a family won't be broken
by something like that.

194
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,391
Was it that way when my mother
left this house?

195
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:02,729
It's true that I lost my temper
at that time.

196
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:06,983
Didn't it make you hate my mother?

197
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,318
Of course, I didn't hate her.

198
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:14,699
I cared for her more than
I felt it was unforgivable.

199
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,577
Looking back, I regret it now.

200
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:21,664
I misjudged what I should protect

201
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:25,626
and because of that,
I lost my beloved daughter.

202
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:28,004
And Miyo,

203
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:32,592
I care for you
as much as I did for your mother.

204
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:34,302
Me?

205
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:35,762
Yes.

206
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:39,515
Since Sumi got married then,
you were born.

207
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,559
And our family was able to survive.

208
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:44,020
I feel great happiness

209
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:46,189
from meeting you like this.

210
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:53,154
{\an8}<i>I didn't know my grandfather
was feeling the same way as I do.</i>

211
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:56,657
<i>He said things that were
not true to his heart,</i>

212
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:00,328
<i>which hurt someone important to him,
and he regrets it.</i>

213
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:04,791
<i>And my mother
wished me happiness when she...</i>

214
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,016
<i>Someday, the time will come...</i>

215
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:24,477
<i>When your ability will become necessary.</i>

216
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:26,062
<i>So...</i>

217
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,185
{\an8}Miyo,

218
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:08,855
{\an8}I love you.

219
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:11,023
Mother...

220
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:27,665
Apparently, Sumi's seal has now
been completely broken.

221
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:31,210
Grandfather!

222
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:33,880
What is it?

223
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:37,383
I just received a message
from the military.

224
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,595
What? Are you saying that Kudo...?

225
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:43,764
What's happened to my husband-to-be?

226
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:49,520
Kiyoka Kudo was attacked
by the Grotesqueries and collapsed.

227
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:51,063
I don't have the details.

228
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:55,151
He was injured during a maneuver
and hasn't regained consciousness.

229
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:57,528
Can't be...

230
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:01,282
Where do you think you're going?

231
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:03,826
Wait!

232
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,329
Let me go and see him!

233
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,252
I... don't want to give up.

234
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,963
I can't let you go.

235
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:18,799
You can't stop me. I'm going at any cost.

236
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,844
You have it wrong.

237
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:26,432
The one who is making you
stay here is not me.

238
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:30,811
I made a deal with someone.

239
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,188
Arata!

240
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:34,732
I don't want to lie to Miyo anymore.

241
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,571
{\an8}The one I made a deal with is Mikado.

242
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:46,118
{\an8}<i>Our family had long wanted the maiden
of Dream-Sight back.</i>

243
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,454
{\an8}<i>Mikado agreed to help us.</i>

244
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,373
{\an8}<i>In return, he said</i>

245
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,585
{\an8}<i>Miyo must not have contact with any
other people with supernatural abilities.</i>

246
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,463
{\an8}<i>He ordered us to completely
hide the existence</i>

247
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:00,174
{\an8}<i>of the maiden of Dream-Sight.</i>

248
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,510
Why?

249
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:05,930
I don't fully understand
what His Majesty is trying to do.

250
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,767
But if you disobey his order,
surely not only the Usuba family,

251
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,103
but also you will be severely punished.

252
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:13,354
What...?

253
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,026
Grandfather!

254
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,451
I can't give you up.

255
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,830
Just as you can't give up Kiyoka Kudo.

256
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,627
But I made a decision too.

257
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:41,090
You want to go see Kiyoka Kudo, right?

258
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:42,008
What?

259
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,012
If I'm going to let you see him,
I'm accompanying you.

260
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:47,888
Because I want to protect you.

261
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,892
My, my. What can I do?

262
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,396
You two are both
my precious grandchildren.

263
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:59,358
Supporting you two
is the role of a grandfather.

264
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:02,445
Well, go on.

265
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:08,868
Thank you very much.

266
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:18,919
<i>Sir...</i>

267
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,088
<i>Please be alright.</i>

268
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:28,179
Why? Commander...

269
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:30,848
Why did he have to get hurt instead of me?

270
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:35,686
Sir!

271
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:37,730
Miyo!

272
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:40,066
Oh, good, you came!

273
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,988
Sir...

274
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:52,495
You're alive...

275
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,123
{\an8}Since you two were apart,
I was so worried.

276
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:59,085
{\an8}What if this was his final day
and you weren't here?

277
00:22:59,168 --> 00:23:00,836
{\an8}What would I do?

278
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,796
{\an8}Hazuki.

279
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:04,340
He will wake up.

280
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,425
I know he will.

281
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:09,053
I will never give up.

282
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:15,726
{\an8}Miyo, you possess the power
that could awaken Kiyoka Kudo...

283
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:19,480
{\an8}the supernatural ability
of Dream-Sight.

284
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:22,566
{\an8}My supernatural ability...

285
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,652
{\an8}I can't say for sure,

286
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:26,862
{\an8}but I think it's worth trying.

287
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,161
I'll do it.

288
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:38,332
{\an8}If that is what I can do.

289
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:40,918
