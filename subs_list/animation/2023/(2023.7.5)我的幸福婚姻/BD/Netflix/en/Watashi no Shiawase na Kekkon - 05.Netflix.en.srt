1
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:08,966
Will you look at that?
The color is perfect too.

2
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,176
It matches your complexion.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,138
I can't wait till you try it on.

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,059
<i>It's the color of cherry blossoms,
like the kimono my mother used to wear.</i>

5
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:22,438
It suits you very well.
Don't you think so, Young Master?

6
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,689
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,191
But sir?

8
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:30,946
I can't possibly take
all of these nice pieces of kimono.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,199
It's to say thanks for the hair string.
Just accept them.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,201
Okay.

11
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:44,460
It was Mr. Kudo himself
who chose this pattern for you.

12
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,965
I'm happy for you, Ms. Miyo.

13
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:51,675
Yes.

14
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,969
Thank you very much.

15
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:08,984
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

16
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:28,605
{\an8}EPISODE 5 RIPPLES

17
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,359
{\an8}I never thought she would
win the heart of Kudo.

18
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,944
That's quite a feat.

19
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:37,072
Mr. Tatsuishi, is that some kind of joke?

20
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,367
It's no joke. It's the truth
about your older sister.

21
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:44,037
Don't you want to know
how Miyo is doing now?

22
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:52,588
That man...

23
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,594
It's the man I saw that time.

24
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:00,053
As you can see...

25
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:04,016
Miyo is getting along well
with Kiyoka Kudo.

26
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,227
This man is Kiyoka Kudo?

27
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:11,732
I still can't believe his bride
will be that girl, Miyo.

28
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,904
Honestly, it's causing a problem
with our plan.

29
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:20,115
- We wanted her to be Kazushi's wife.
-<i>I won't forgive her!</i>

30
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,451
Shinichi didn't want you,
his beloved daughter,

31
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:26,830
to marry into a family with a bad
reputation like the Kudo family, I'm sure.

32
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,212
I'm going to go ask Father.

33
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,464
You're concerned too, aren't you?

34
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:36,757
Y-Yes.

35
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:42,262
Leave it to me.
My father can't say no to me.

36
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,015
<i>What a foolish girl.</i>

37
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:48,602
<i>Thanks to her,
I don't need to do anything.</i>

38
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:55,943
<i>My husband-to-be arranged for me
to have a meeting with Hana.</i>

39
00:03:56,443 --> 00:03:58,737
<i>To show my gratitude,</i>

40
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,907
<i>I decided to have a dinner party</i>

41
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,409
<i>and invite Mr. Godo as well.</i>

42
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:09,915
Boy, am I excited to see Ms. Miyo again!

43
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:12,125
You'd better behave yourself.

44
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,586
Aren't you on night patrol from tomorrow?

45
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,922
Wow, Ms. Miyo's cooking...

46
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,216
I wonder what we're having?

47
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,634
Don't say her name like that!

48
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,678
Why? Are you jealous?

49
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,638
Of course not.

50
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:28,016
I just had a momentary urge for violence.

51
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,060
Which is basically jealousy.

52
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:31,561
Did you say something?

53
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,106
Uh, no, nothing.

54
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,367
Ready.

55
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:48,578
Hurry up and get out!

56
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,831
Hey, you don't have to be so rough!

57
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:52,791
I'll tell Ms. Miyo on you!

58
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,628
Ow...

59
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:03,176
It's all right if you disappear now.

60
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,470
Give me a break...

61
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:09,474
Welcome home, sir.

62
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,735
Whoa, Ms. Miyo!

63
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:22,446
Mr. Godo, welcome to our home too.

64
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,363
Wow.

65
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,866
You look especially beautiful today.

66
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:38,503
Sir, I...

67
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:41,131
You're so... beautiful.

68
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,513
You look good in that kimono.

69
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,851
Maybe I should go home after all.

70
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:56,313
Oh, pardon me, Mr. Godo.

71
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,690
Please come in.

72
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,495
Big Sister, happier than me?

73
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,039
I will never...

74
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,166
ever allow it.

75
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,800
Thank you for the meal!

76
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,177
It's delicious!

77
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,972
It's really good!

78
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,559
Please help yourself.

79
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:39,439
To think of being able to eat
Ms. Miyo's delicious cooking every day!

80
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,566
I'm jealous of you, Commander.

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,612
Oh, I want to try this too.

82
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:47,989
So good!

83
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,993
Mr. Godo, shall I pour you some?

84
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,912
Oh, thank you very much.

85
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:10,470
Mr. Godo, thank you for helping me
meet with Hana the other day.

86
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,975
Um, all I did was drive her here and back.

87
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:20,021
But you did use your precious time
for somebody like me.

88
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,482
I truly appreciate your kindness.

89
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:30,740
Ms. Miyo! I'm happy because nobody has
ever said anything like this to me before!

90
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:34,369
Why don't you leave the fiendish commander
and marry me?

91
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,376
Godo! What the hell?!

92
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,879
I'm just kidding.

93
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,173
Um, Mr. Godo.

94
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,258
I appreciate your offer,

95
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:51,052
but I prefer my husband-to-be.

96
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,512
I'm so sorry.

97
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:57,058
I didn't think you'd take it seriously...

98
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,897
I guess the fiendish commander
is a human after all.

99
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,648
Did you say something?

100
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,567
Uh, no, nothing.

101
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,539
Good grief. He definitely
had too much to drink.

102
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,791
And he's aware that
it's going to get busy.

103
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,085
Was this dinner a problem for you?

104
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,129
No, no. It's not that.

105
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:31,092
Well, it was surprising when you said
you wanted to invite Godo for dinner.

106
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,351
Were you able to accomplish
what you wanted?

107
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:40,644
Yes.

108
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:45,106
Thanks to you, I was able
to show my gratitude to Mr. Godo.

109
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,235
Thank you very much.

110
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:53,740
Why?

111
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:56,034
It doesn't matter.

112
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:58,245
Forget about Miyo.

113
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:02,249
But I'm the one more worthy
to marry into the Kudo family.

114
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:03,416
You just can't.

115
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,501
Why?

116
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:07,003
Why won't you listen
to what I have to say?

117
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,093
Kaya. If you have too much free time,

118
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:15,720
be good and go do some training
to become a good wife.

119
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,225
Father!

120
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:28,024
<i>You're different from her.
You must always be superior to her.</i>

121
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:38,618
Koji?

122
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,998
Huh?

123
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,417
Why are you here this late at night?

124
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,007
{\an8}Listen, Koji.

125
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,803
Wouldn't you rather
get engaged to Big Sister?

126
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:19,909
- Stay away.
- Help me.

127
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,120
- Help...
- Help me...

128
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:27,584
- Stay away...
- Help...

129
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,170
Help...

130
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,054
Think about what you did.
Don't show your face until you're sorry.

131
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,490
{\an8}Miyo.

132
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,954
<i>Remnants of supernatural ability...?</i>

133
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,540
<i>But there's no sign
of the barrier being broken.</i>

134
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,251
<i>What does it mean?</i>

135
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,587
I'm so...

136
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,840
{\an8}sorry.

137
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,102
{\an8}Miyo, wake up!

138
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,608
Are you all right?

139
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:40,281
Huh? Sir?

140
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,119
You were groaning in your sleep.

141
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,621
Were you having
a bad dream or something?

142
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,207
A dream...

143
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:58,508
You don't have to
force yourself to remember.

144
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:02,637
If anything unusual occurs,
don't hesitate to tell me.

145
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:04,889
Okay.

146
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,099
{\an8}Remember.

147
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,517
{\an8}No matter what happens,

148
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,269
{\an8}I will always be there for you.

149
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:13,565
{\an8}Understood, sir.

150
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:41,176
{\an8}<i>Wouldn't you rather
get engaged to Big Sister?</i>

151
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:45,847
{\an8}Mr. Tatsuishi said he'll cooperate.

152
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,684
{\an8}You'll cooperate too, of course, right?

153
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,189
{\an8}What are Kaya and my father thinking?

154
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:01,070
There, done.

155
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,406
He's going to be so happy.

156
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,077
The Young Master tends
not to bother with meals when he's busy.

157
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,371
He's probably famished by now.

158
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:15,335
I hope he doesn't mind me
going to his workplace.

159
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,170
It'll be all right.

160
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:21,508
As soon as you're ready,
we should bring these to him together.

161
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,675
Yes.

162
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,347
Ms. Miyo?

163
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,348
Yes.

164
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:34,103
{\an8}Why don't you bring
this drawstring pouch today?

165
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:38,733
{\an8}The Young Master chose this pattern
so it would match that kimono.

166
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,945
It's pretty.

167
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,113
I think you should use it.

168
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:46,574
The Young Master would love to see it.

169
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,868
I will use it. Thank you.

170
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,745
Okay then, shall we go?

171
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:53,998
I think we should hurry a bit,

172
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,292
so as not to be late for lunchtime.

173
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,252
Y-Yes.

174
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:08,388
Father. Do you have a minute?

175
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,473
Yes, what is it?

176
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,270
Oh, Koji.

177
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,813
Kaya.

178
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,064
Why are you here?

179
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,691
Why?

180
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,277
I'm here to trade
fiancés with Big Sister.

181
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,529
Will you stop kidding around?

182
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:26,239
Kidding? I'm not kidding.

183
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:29,409
I know you like Big Sister better than me.

184
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,872
Your father didn't give permission, right?

185
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,749
There's no way it would happen
without his consent.

186
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,253
But what if
Big Sister herself agrees to it?

187
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:47,510
What are you up to?

188
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:54,434
{\an8}Well, you'll see. Just trust me.

189
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,519
{\an8}All you have to do is watch.

190
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:08,031
Miyo. Yurie.

191
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:10,199
What are both of you doing here?

192
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,368
Good day, sir.

193
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:15,330
Sorry to bother you at work.

194
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,293
Well, I was worried
you hadn't eaten properly.

195
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,795
So I brought you lunch.

196
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,797
Oh, right.

197
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:26,799
That's helpful.

198
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,928
It must have been tough walking here
under the blazing sun.

199
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,638
Do you want to take a rest inside?

200
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,056
No thank you.

201
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,185
I appreciate it, but I don't want to
be in your way, so I'll go home.

202
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,186
Okay.

203
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,521
We'll be going, then.

204
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:47,487
Miyo, do you have the amulet with you?

205
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,698
Yes, I have it in here.

206
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:52,367
Good.

207
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,243
I just wanted to make sure.

208
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,244
Commander Kudo!

209
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,454
I'll be right there!

210
00:15:57,413 --> 00:16:00,917
I would have liked to drive you home,
but I don't have time at the moment.

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,293
It's okay.

212
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:06,339
I'm sorry to have bothered you
when you're busy.

213
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:10,218
No worries. Take care going home, you two.

214
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,348
The Young Master was being shy, wasn't he?

215
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:23,356
Ms. Miyo? What's the matter?

216
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,608
Well, I... um...

217
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:29,737
I seemed to have left the amulet at home.

218
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,572
Oh dear!

219
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:34,242
It must be because I rushed you.

220
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,744
No, I was not mindful enough.

221
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,748
I promised him I would always
bring it with me.

222
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:44,669
Ms. Miyo, we must go straight home,
without delay.

223
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:45,670
Yes.

224
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:51,843
<i>I can't believe I messed up.</i>

225
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:56,639
<i>That was a precious amulet
that he gave me.</i>

226
00:16:57,306 --> 00:17:00,685
<i>I was so excited about my new pouch
that I forgot about the amulet.</i>

227
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:16,868
Ms. Yurie!

228
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:20,496
Ms. Miyo!

229
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,540
Ms. Yurie!

230
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,710
Ms. Miyo!

231
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,472
Ms. Miyo!

232
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:43,227
Kaya, Father, what are you
trying to do to Miyo?

233
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:47,774
{\an8}We're going to make Big Sister turn down
the marriage offer from Mr. Kudo.

234
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:49,275
Right, Mr. Tatsuishi?

235
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,737
You know we can't just stand by
in this situation.

236
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:57,825
Anyway, I'll be waiting for you
at the Saimori house.

237
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,751
It's the only way to get that girl.
I have no choice.

238
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,045
After all this time? Why?

239
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:11,464
This is a matter between families.

240
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:16,886
Miyo being isolated in her family was
beneficial to us, the Tatsuishi family.

241
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:19,889
What the hell...?

242
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:22,433
{\an8}You wouldn't understand.

243
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:26,479
{\an8}I would do anything
for the continuance of our family.

244
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,028
It's my duty as
the head of the Tatsuishi family.

245
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:36,531
Unforgivable...

246
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,785
So all this time...

247
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:44,914
you looked the other way
on Miyo being treated awfully

248
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:48,668
{\an8}for your own advantage?

249
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:54,298
I won't forgive you!

250
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:01,931
Oh? Do you intend to fight me
using supernatural ability?

251
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,684
I don't want to hear anything
from you anymore.

252
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,936
{\an8}It's futile. Stop it now.

253
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,814
{\an8}I won't let you have your way
with Miyo's life anymore!

254
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,027
Wha...?

255
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:18,823
Impressive. I didn't know
you had this much power.

256
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:20,783
Huh? Why won't it...?

257
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,077
Move!

258
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,954
{\an8}You idiot.

259
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:31,711
{\an8}There's no way a barely trained
novice like you can withstand my power.

260
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:49,187
If you think you can defy me,
stay there on the floor and sleep it off.

261
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,439
Damn...

262
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,941
Why?

263
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,278
Let's go.

264
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,362
Yes, sir.

265
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:01,574
<i>Koji.</i>

266
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:05,828
<i>If you want something,
you have to select the means to get it.</i>

267
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:10,041
<i>You're perpetually second-rate
because you never have any strategy.</i>

268
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,840
I am an idiot.

269
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,592
Are you going to face down like that

270
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:23,346
and wait for time to pass again?

271
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:24,597
Big Brother...

272
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,982
Damn it.

273
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:39,278
I couldn't do anything again.
I can't even win against Father.

274
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:41,864
I'm still so immature.

275
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,866
Then, are you going to give up?

276
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,666
Of course, it's easier not to
get involved in complicated matters.

277
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:56,629
But why did you stand up to him
in the first place?

278
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,680
Go wash your face.

279
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,390
Someone is waiting for you, right?

280
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,476
<i>Miyo.</i>

281
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:13,396
<i>I'm not going to give up.</i>

282
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:15,648
<i>I've got to save Miyo...</i>

283
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:18,901
I'm sorry, Young Master.

284
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,904
Miyo was kidnapped?!

285
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:23,948
I was supposed to keep an eye on her.

286
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,908
I'm so sorry!

287
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:27,660
What about the amulet?

288
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:29,120
She must have had it with her.

289
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:30,162
Actually...

290
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:33,916
She realized she hadn't brought it
with her after we left you.

291
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:36,669
Ms. Miyo...

292
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,923
<i>I know who did it, in all likelihood.</i>

293
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,718
<i>I know where Miyo must be...</i>

294
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,678
Hey! There's no trespassing here!

295
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:49,181
Let me go! I've come to meet Mr. Kudo!

296
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,725
Commander!

297
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:51,726
Mr. Kudo!

298
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:02,862
I know I'm out of line to ask you
something like this.

299
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,573
But, please.

300
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,868
I can't save Miyo alone...

301
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,918
