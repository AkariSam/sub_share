1
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,262
Where am I...?

2
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:17,516
Huh?

3
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:25,691
Somebody...

4
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:29,945
Somebody, help me! Somebody!

5
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:36,326
Ah, you're awake already, Big Sister.

6
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:39,705
{\an8}How are you feeling?

7
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:42,082
Did you have a good dream?

8
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:55,804
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

9
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:18,929
EPISODE 6
DETERMINATION AND THUNDER

10
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,809
We need to go faster!

11
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,562
Being impatient like that
won't make things better.

12
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,355
You should calm down a little.

13
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:33,569
{\an8}You're awfully calm for someone
whose fiancée was kidnapped.

14
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:36,405
{\an8}We have no idea what she's going through.

15
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,492
Are you sure of her whereabouts?

16
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,119
Yes. I'm certain Miyo is...

17
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:44,413
at the Saimori house.

18
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:52,462
{\an8}Since you took so long to come to,
I thought your heart finally stopped.

19
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:57,509
W-Why are you doing this to me?

20
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,511
You are very irritating.

21
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:06,518
You should have stayed a servant
or died in a ditch somewhere.

22
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:08,270
You should know your place!

23
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:13,442
I order you to reject
Mr. Kudo's marriage proposal right now.

24
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:15,819
Listen carefully.

25
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:21,325
You must tell him directly
that you reject his offer.

26
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:27,497
After all, being a wife to Mr. Kudo
is too much of a burden for you, I think.

27
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,173
That pretty kimono you're wearing,
for example...

28
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,384
Don't you think it's out of step
with your position?

29
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:46,016
Say, won't you promise us
that you'll reject his marriage proposal?

30
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,561
Otherwise, I will have to remake
this precious kimono of yours...

31
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:56,526
to match your lowly position, Big Sister.

32
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:05,619
Since you got him to buy you
such an expensive kimono,

33
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:10,457
it should be easy for you
to scrap the marriage proposal.

34
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,461
{\an8}Once I get engaged to Mr. Kudo,

35
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,714
{\an8}I'll give Koji back to you.

36
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,466
Well, Big Sister?

37
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,345
What are you going to say to Mr. Kudo?

38
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,889
No...

39
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:26,848
No?

40
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:29,893
Stop it...

41
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,611
- No!
- That's incorrect.

42
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:44,032
- Don't!
- Those are not the words I want to hear.

43
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,499
Let me hear from your mouth, Big Sister.

44
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,251
Say that you'll reject

45
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,128
his marriage offer.

46
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,172
<i>Why?</i>

47
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,509
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

48
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:07,264
<i>It would be easy for me to give up now.</i>

49
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:10,600
<i>But this...</i>

50
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:14,896
<i>this is the one thing
I don't want to give away to anyone.</i>

51
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,651
What's the matter?
Did you lose your voice?

52
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:23,405
You are so useless, Big Sister.

53
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,164
I can't...

54
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:36,126
I can't give in...

55
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,170
to a demand like that.

56
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:39,671
I won't do it.

57
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:42,841
Don't defy us!

58
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:47,637
{\an8}You little...

59
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:48,638
{\an8}Mother?

60
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:51,767
Leave it to me.

61
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,902
Like I thought,
the floor suits you better, Big Sister.

62
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:09,242
Hey. You're a failure, aren't you?

63
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:13,789
Unlike me, you have neither
Spirit-Sight nor any redeeming qualities.

64
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:18,668
An embarrassment to the family like you
can't possibly be Mr. Kudo's wife.

65
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,463
It was a mistake from the start.

66
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:27,677
- Hey! Open the gate!
-<i>Don't you think this'll be good for you?</i>

67
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,181
<i>You'll have this Saimori house
and Koji as your own.</i>

68
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:35,602
Isn't that what you've wanted
all along, Big Sister?

69
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,438
<i>I...</i>

70
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:41,066
I am the one...

71
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:44,194
I'm the fiancée...

72
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:47,614
I'm the fiancée of Kiyoka Kudo.

73
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,826
I'll never give that up.

74
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,410
What the...

75
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,454
Enough is enough!

76
00:06:56,665 --> 00:07:00,502
You owe me for raising you till now.

77
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:05,257
But you bite the hand that fed you
as soon as you left to marry, huh?

78
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,009
My, such a nasty child!

79
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:15,350
I'm not gonna let
someone like you ruin my life!

80
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:20,105
{\an8}<i>If it was me from the past,
I would have apologized...</i>

81
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:25,861
{\an8}<i>just to let the storm pass...
That's how I lived.</i>

82
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,239
<i>It was easier that way.</i>

83
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:33,368
<i>But I don't want to give up.</i>

84
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:40,125
<i>I'm not the person I used to be
who couldn't do anything.</i>

85
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,501
<i>I want to go back...</i>

86
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,004
<i>to where my husband-to-be is.</i>

87
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,882
Hey, stand back a little.

88
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:48,884
Whoa.

89
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:51,011
What a poor loser you are!

90
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,264
What was that?!

91
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,271
What the...

92
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,232
I can't believe it.

93
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,526
Let's go.

94
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,528
Huh? Uh, right!

95
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,780
What's going on?!

96
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:14,493
Mr. Kudo! Stop!

97
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:16,161
Explain this to me!

98
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:18,788
Where is Miyo, Mr. Saimori?

99
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,165
Miyo?

100
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:23,668
If this is about Miyo, she won't be
returning to the Kudo house any longer.

101
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:27,380
Father! How could you...?

102
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,799
Kiyoka Kudo.

103
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,802
I didn't expect you here so quickly.

104
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,263
Where is my fiancée?

105
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,558
Miyo won't see you anymore.

106
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,810
She said she's not going back.

107
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:44,898
I'll verify her will by asking her myself.

108
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:46,942
If you can't answer me,
get out of my way.

109
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:48,652
I refuse.

110
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:51,112
If you're forcing your way in,

111
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,073
we won't just silently
sit back and watch.

112
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:56,326
Then, I will use force to enter.

113
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,788
W-Wait!

114
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,415
What in the world is going on, Tatsuishi?

115
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,043
Ask your daughter later.

116
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,837
The main gate was blown to pieces.

117
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:12,592
If you let him in,
the whole house might get destroyed.

118
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:16,471
If that bothers you,
then you must lend a hand.

119
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,558
- Hah!
- Hah!

120
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,111
He's the head of
the Kudo family all right.

121
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:56,261
They're just wasting time.

122
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,974
Is he a genuine monster...?

123
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:03,393
You're in the way.

124
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:04,811
{\an8}Move.

125
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,701
<i>They're no match for him.</i>

126
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,830
<i>Their power is like babies in comparison.</i>

127
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,957
<i>So this demonstrates...</i>

128
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,712
<i>the potential of the most powerful
supernatural ability of today...</i>

129
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,054
What was that sound?

130
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,688
I'm tired of your behavior!

131
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,775
Hurry up and say it!

132
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:55,236
Say that you'll
reject the Kudo family's offer!

133
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:58,198
{\an8}No, I won't.

134
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,494
You brat!

135
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:07,874
I'm telling you to remember your place!

136
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,712
I'll never surrender to you.

137
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:16,758
For my husband-to-be who believes in me,
I'll stand my ground!

138
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,303
Miyo...

139
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:22,889
A storehouse?

140
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:23,932
Yes.

141
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:27,310
There is an old storehouse
that's rarely used now.

142
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,939
Perhaps Miyo was taken there.

143
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,232
Show me the way to it.

144
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:33,316
Yes.

145
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:50,583
Don't let him go there!

146
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,085
Father!

147
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:54,796
Using fire in a place like this?

148
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,090
How could you be so foolish?

149
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,435
This is dreadful...

150
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,361
I won't let you take Miyo!

151
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:19,863
That's enough.

152
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,716
I just knocked him unconscious.

153
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,551
Let's hurry.

154
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:47,015
Why is this happening?

155
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,441
Say it already!
Say that you won't marry him!

156
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,069
Now!

157
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:07,785
<i>In the past,
I was just waiting for my time to die.</i>

158
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:14,250
<i>Every single day
brought more suffering and sadness.</i>

159
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:18,463
<i>I was tired of living
with my emotions shut off.</i>

160
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:23,801
<i>There wasn't any place where I belonged.
That's what I always thought.</i>

161
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:26,763
<i>But...</i>

162
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,976
<i>I was wrong.</i>

163
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,606
{\an8}I'm the one who wants you to be here.

164
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,026
<i>This was the place where I belonged.</i>

165
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,737
<i>Next to him.</i>

166
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:46,741
<i>Say it! Hurry up!</i>

167
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:51,663
{\an8}I won't... I'll never say it...

168
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:56,209
{\an8}Say it!

169
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:00,463
I will be...

170
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,925
by his side...

171
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:18,982
Mr. Kudo?

172
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,446
Miyo!

173
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,406
Oh...

174
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,370
<i>He really came for me.</i>

175
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,582
<i>Sir...</i>

176
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:40,795
<i>I... never gave up, sir.</i>

177
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:46,509
Miyo.

178
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,641
Sir...

179
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:56,185
You'll be okay now.

180
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:03,109
You came all the way here
for someone like me.

181
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,073
Thank you... very much.

182
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,717
What's with all this noise?

183
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,185
No... This can't be.

184
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:39,729
No!

185
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:43,900
What were you doing to her until now?

186
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:50,323
She had no way to resist.
What were you trying to achieve

187
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:52,492
by hurting her this much?

188
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:56,996
I didn't do anything wrong.

189
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,585
All I wanted to do was
to correct a mistake, that's it.

190
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,128
A mistake?

191
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:08,925
Big Sister doesn't have Spirit-Sight,
her appearance is scrawny,

192
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:11,010
and she was even incompetent as a servant.

193
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:17,016
It must be a mistake for a person
like that to be accepted into your family.

194
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,980
My father and mother both say
that I'm the best one.

195
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,649
{\an8}They say I'm nothing like Big Sister.

196
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,276
I'm superior in every way to--

197
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,277
Shut up.

198
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,949
I don't want to hear
any more nonsense from you.

199
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:44,544
Why? Why don't you understand?

200
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,379
It's not fair!

201
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:52,010
I've heard enough of your stupid bragging.

202
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:59,308
There's not a chance in hell
I would choose an arrogant woman like you.

203
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:00,560
Get out of the way.

204
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,534
How...

205
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,829
How can this happen?

206
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:23,207
Kaya, we should evacuate too.

207
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,836
I wasn't wrong.

208
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:30,548
Let go! Just leave me alone!

209
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:31,466
Be quiet!

210
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,094
What are you doing?

211
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,347
Big Sister is the one you love, right?

212
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:42,185
You don't care about me.
Just flee on your own!

213
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:48,066
Yeah, you're right.
The one I care for is Miyo!

214
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:56,240
But Miyo would lament your death
if you die, even if it's you.

215
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:59,243
It would leave
another painful scar on her.

216
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:03,581
And it would be because of you...
no, because of us.

217
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:06,793
That's why
I'm not leaving here without you.

218
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:29,524
My, you've grown, Miyo.

219
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,278
<i>Mother!</i>

220
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:40,409
I'm sorry you had to go through
so much hardship because of me.

221
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,664
You have to believe in yourself.

222
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:48,292
{\an8}Believe in the power you have inside you.

223
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,674
<i>The power...</i>

224
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,592
<i>inside me?</i>

225
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,813
Atrocious.

226
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:11,190
Obnoxious.

227
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:14,026
Such an annoyance.

228
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,905
That useless Tatsuishi.

229
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:23,119
At this rate, the Usuba blood
will be possessed by the Kudo family.

230
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:25,955
Your Majesty.

231
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:30,710
I would like to ask for your permission.

232
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:35,965
Please give us the opportunity
to fulfill our long-cherished wish.

233
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,428
So that the thing
is placed where it belongs...

234
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:43,514
The situation will change soon.

235
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,184
I authorize your action.

236
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:50,813
However, do not get the timing wrong.

237
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:52,481
Yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,360
{\an8}Then as discussed,

239
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,822
we will commence the plan.

240
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,117
Do not fail

241
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,995
to crush that supernatural ability.

242
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,521
Sir...

243
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,774
Miyo!

244
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,151
Sir!

245
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,278
Yes, it's me.

246
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,448
Don't push yourself. Stay in bed.

247
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:44,033
Um...

248
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:45,409
But...

249
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:59,257
Are you really all right?

250
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,636
Yes. Uh, sir...

251
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:06,639
{\an8}This all happened
because I was not careful enough...

252
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,182
{\an8}It wasn't your fault.

253
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,477
Not at all. None of it was.

254
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:14,939
You're not to blame.

255
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,490
Thank you very much,

256
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:26,951
sir.

257
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,203
Ms. Miyo!

258
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:36,711
Ms. Yurie.

259
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,589
Ms. Miyo! I'm so relieved!

260
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:42,925
I'm so glad you've awakened!

261
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:47,847
Ms. Yurie, please raise your head.

262
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:51,559
I was so worried about your condition.

263
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:54,687
If something happened to you, I'd...

264
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:02,570
We're so happy you're safe, Miyo.

265
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:09,327
Yes.

266
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,918
