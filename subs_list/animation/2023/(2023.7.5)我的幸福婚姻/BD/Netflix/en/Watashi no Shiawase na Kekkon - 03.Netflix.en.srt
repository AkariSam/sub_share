1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,471
Are you getting used to living here?

2
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:15,806
Yes.

3
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:18,517
What do you do during the day?

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,103
Don't you have too much free time
if housework is all you do?

5
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:22,730
Well...

6
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:28,444
I read magazines Ms. Yurie lends me,
and I sew some things.

7
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,823
{\an8}Actually, I'm thinking of
going into town this weekend.

8
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:38,454
All right. What should I do about
preparing your lunch and supper?

9
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,331
You're coming too. We're going together.

10
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,458
Pardon?

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,544
You haven't been to town once
since you came here, have you?

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,671
That's true.

13
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,673
Don't you want to go?

14
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:51,300
Um...

15
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,342
What?

16
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,386
I can't go.

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,058
I don't have a reason to go,
and I'll be a bother to you.

18
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:03,604
{\an8}You won't be a bother,
and you don't need a reason to go.

19
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:06,607
B-But won't I be in the way?

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,984
You won't be in the way at all.

21
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,528
You can wear the same <i>furisode</i>
you wore when you came here.

22
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:14,990
Is anything else worrying you?

23
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,116
No.

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,368
Be ready to go, then.

25
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:20,329
Thanks for the meal.

26
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:28,045
Sir...

27
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:37,888
<i>At that moment</i>

28
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:41,809
<i>I didn't have any idea
what my husband-to-be was thinking.</i>

29
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:47,022
<i>Thus, our first date
was suddenly scheduled.</i>

30
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:59,701
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

31
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:22,910
EPISODE 3
OUR FIRST DATE

32
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:31,919
Oh.

33
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,758
Ms. Miyo, may I come in?

34
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,176
Y-Yes, please.

35
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:47,309
How are your preparations going, Ms. Miyo?

36
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:49,311
Um, fine.

37
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:52,898
Please don't hesitate to use this mirror.

38
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,698
<i>How ill-matched we are.</i>

39
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:04,451
Ms. Miyo?

40
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,621
Wouldn't you like to put on some makeup?

41
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:12,042
I... I haven't tried using makeup so much.

42
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,962
Oh, then leave it up to me.

43
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:19,925
B-But I don't own any makeup or tools.

44
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,552
You don't have to worry. Here.

45
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,599
I have all the tools you need.

46
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,144
This is so nice.

47
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,480
Although I don't have anything
new and fancy,

48
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:37,985
I'm sure this would look beautiful on you.

49
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,991
I'll start applying the face powder,

50
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,868
so would you please
close your eyes for a bit?

51
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,977
There. It's done.

52
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,277
I wonder how Young Master will react

53
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,363
when he sees how pretty you are, Ms. Miyo.

54
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:26,908
Are you about ready yet?

55
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,661
I'll be right there.

56
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:34,666
Pardon me for keeping you waiting.

57
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,220
Sir?

58
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,931
Uh, no. You didn't keep me waiting.

59
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,808
Sorry to have rushed you.

60
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:52,809
It's all right.

61
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,811
Shall we go?

62
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:56,563
Yes.

63
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,819
Sir, where are we going today?

64
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:07,157
Oh, didn't I tell you?
We're going to my workplace first.

65
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,200
Huh?

66
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:13,330
Don't get so nervous. I'm just parking
the car there before we go into town.

67
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:15,874
I... I see.

68
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,851
<i>So this is where he works...</i>

69
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:40,107
Let's go now.

70
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,066
Yes.

71
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,359
Could it be?

72
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:45,445
Godo.

73
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,239
So it <i>is</i> you, Commander.

74
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:52,160
Aren't you off duty today?

75
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:55,080
Yeah, I just came to park my car here.

76
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:55,997
Oh, I see.

77
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,000
Uh? Um... Hmm?

78
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,505
And, who might this be?

79
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:06,007
My companion.
Don't pry into my private life.

80
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,761
Whoa! Commander has a companion?
That never happens!

81
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:12,514
And such a beautiful companion at that.

82
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,099
Hey.

83
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:15,016
Huh?

84
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,520
I said don't pry into my private life.
Didn't you hear me?

85
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,647
Oops. Excuse me.

86
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:24,776
{\an8}Stop fooling around and get back
to your post right now.

87
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,279
Yes, sir! Have a nice day, sir.

88
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,037
Good grief...

89
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,000
He's my close aide, Godo.

90
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,295
Despite his behavior, he does have
superior supernatural abilities...

91
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,672
although I'm reluctant to admit it.

92
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:52,804
Okay. Is there anywhere you want to go?

93
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:54,556
Huh?

94
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:57,684
Don't you have something
you need or want to buy?

95
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,895
N-No.

96
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,438
Nothing in particular...

97
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,985
<i>What should I do?
I can't think of anything I want at all.</i>

98
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,946
Nothing?

99
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,949
Then, you should accompany me
for my shopping.

100
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:15,452
Certainly.

101
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,714
Are you enjoying yourself?

102
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,634
I-I'm sorry.

103
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:33,470
I shouldn't have gotten
so enamored with the scenery...

104
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:37,724
Don't worry about it.
You can enjoy the scenery all you want.

105
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,977
Nobody here disapproves, including me.

106
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:42,562
But...

107
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:49,236
You don't have to think about
causing any inconvenience.

108
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:53,823
I'm the one who asked you
to come into town with me.

109
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:55,742
Got it?

110
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:58,870
{\an8}Yes.

111
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,500
Just pay attention and don't get lost.

112
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,336
I'll be careful.

113
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,379
Good.

114
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,885
<i>How is he rumored to be
a cold and merciless man?</i>

115
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,765
<i>Look at how kind he is.</i>

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,435
We had a deal, didn't we?

117
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,271
What deal?

118
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:27,941
Don't play dumb!
Why did you give Miyo to the Kudo family?

119
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,901
I asked you to let her marry
our eldest son.

120
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,404
Oh, that deal.

121
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:40,412
At the same time, we had a marriage offer
from the Kudo family we couldn't refuse.

122
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:44,040
Miyo's mother is from that Usuba family.

123
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:47,294
But Miyo didn't inherit
supernatural abilities.

124
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:51,881
Even so, Miyo might have children
who inherit supernatural abilities.

125
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,553
You're that desperate to obtain
the Usuba family's powers, aren't you?

126
00:09:57,512 --> 00:10:01,641
You know the Usuba family's powers
are said to be exceptional!

127
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:06,563
If the Kudo family gets even more
powerful, our positions will be in danger.

128
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:11,568
Kudo will surely get rid of Miyo when
he finds out she doesn't have abilities.

129
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:15,322
When that happens, you can go ahead
and bring her into your family.

130
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,698
Tsk.

131
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:21,453
She'd be thankful and crying with joy
if you picked her up.

132
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,956
<i>No matter how much he loves
his younger daughter,</i>

133
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,542
<i>he must be insane to want to
abandon Miyo.</i>

134
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:31,421
<i>Miyo could be the goose
that lays the golden eggs.</i>

135
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:38,219
So are we in agreement that the Saimori
family will have no say in Miyo's future?

136
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,598
Yes. We basically abandoned that child.

137
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:46,478
I'm not interested in her future,
regardless of whether she lives or dies.

138
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,731
{\an8}I see. Understood.

139
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:54,986
<i>It will be us, the Tatsuishi family,
that will have Miyo Saimori as our own.</i>

140
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,489
<i>I'm not letting the Kudo family
take her from us.</i>

141
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,536
Hey, you.

142
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,621
Y-Yes.

143
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:07,749
What's Father talking about with him?

144
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:12,128
I don't know the details, but it seems
they are discussing Ms. Miyo.

145
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,380
What?

146
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,757
Why did Big Sister's name come up?

147
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,385
I-I'm sorry, Ms. Kaya.

148
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:21,763
Kaya, you shouldn't
raise your voice like that.

149
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,766
Koji, are you trying to lecture me?

150
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,101
Uh...

151
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:31,898
Why do Father and Mr. Tatsuishi
have to talk about Big Sister now?

152
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:35,068
Don't let it bother you so much.

153
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:40,240
I know! Since it's such a nice day,
why don't we go out shopping?

154
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:44,369
That department store opened last week.
Didn't you want to go?

155
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,416
{\an8}I guess we could go.
There's nothing else to do anyway.

156
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,919
There's a new shop in Nakamichi.

157
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:54,295
I heard the shop has...

158
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,298
<i>Koji probably still has
feelings for Big Sister.</i>

159
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:01,928
<i>For all we know, she might already be dead
at the Kudo family residence.</i>

160
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,932
Gosh. How annoying.

161
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,894
SUZUSHIMAYA KIMONO SHOP

162
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,398
This shop is called Suzushimaya.

163
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:16,401
Our Kudo family has been
their loyal customer for years.

164
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,696
I heard they've made garments
for the Emperor.

165
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:23,867
That is very impressive.

166
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,953
Welcome to our shop, Mr. Kudo.

167
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,413
I need your help today.

168
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:42,177
We've already selected some fabrics
based on your request.

169
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,553
Please come inside.

170
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:44,512
Right.

171
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:50,185
Mr. Kudo, I see you've finally...

172
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,562
It's not what it seems, really.

173
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,648
You don't have to be embarrassed.

174
00:12:55,732 --> 00:13:00,069
You've never brought a lady here before.

175
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:03,615
<i>Well, that is true. But...</i>

176
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:06,075
<i>Young Master, have you noticed?</i>

177
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:12,081
<i>Ms. Miyo seems to be mending
her old clothes herself.</i>

178
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:17,504
<i>I was going to say something,
but I don't think she wanted us to know.</i>

179
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:24,594
<i>She wears worn-out clothes
like a poor rural farmer.</i>

180
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:28,932
<i>Probably the only proper kimono she has
is the one she's wearing now.</i>

181
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:33,603
<i>She hardly owns anything
that a girl of her age</i>

182
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:36,481
<i>who comes from
a prominent family should have.</i>

183
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:38,608
Mr. Kudo.

184
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,611
Oh, excuse me.

185
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:43,738
What would look good on her?

186
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:48,743
I think that soft colors like these
would suit the lady.

187
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,246
Also these, and in these combinations.

188
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:52,997
How about that one?

189
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,125
Oh yes.

190
00:13:57,585 --> 00:14:00,755
That's a very fine fabric, too.

191
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:06,761
But it takes a while to tailor the kimono,
so the season might be a little off.

192
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,347
I see.

193
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,811
<i>It would be perfect... on her.</i>

194
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,815
What would you prefer?

195
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,275
Uh, yes.

196
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,819
Make one with this.

197
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:26,531
And also some using the selections
you made would be nice.

198
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,158
Very well, sir.

199
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:33,663
How about this?

200
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:36,416
Do you want to take this home today?

201
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,418
Yes. I'll take it now.

202
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:40,670
By the way, Mr. Kudo.

203
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:41,671
What is it?

204
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:45,425
{\an8}Don't ever let go of that lady.

205
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,677
{\an8}She's like a diamond in the rough

206
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,680
{\an8}with a myriad of opportunities to shine.

207
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:56,436
The items you bought today
are only the beginning.

208
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,190
With your love and wealth,
you must polish her and never let her go.

209
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:02,984
And then...

210
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,444
And then?

211
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:09,324
{\an8}You'll have the enjoyment of dressing
a beautiful lady without hesitation!

212
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,327
Oh... Good lord.

213
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:28,426
Mother.

214
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,849
SWEETS SHOP

215
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,609
How is it?

216
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,737
{\an8}Um, it's good.

217
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:51,032
Your expression doesn't really say so.

218
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:52,825
I-I do think so.

219
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,496
I never see you smile.

220
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,331
Oh. I'm sorry.

221
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:01,250
No, I'm not accusing you.

222
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:03,252
It's just that...

223
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:08,383
I kind of want to see you smile a little.

224
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:09,884
Oh?

225
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,891
Sir, I think you are a bit strange.

226
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:24,148
Please forgive me
for saying something brazen.

227
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:26,526
I'm not angry at you at all.

228
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,528
So don't cower like that.

229
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:30,196
But...

230
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:36,285
{\an8}You and I

231
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:38,997
{\an8}are supposed to get married
if all goes well.

232
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,666
{\an8}I think it's better if we are able to
say whatever we want.

233
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,837
I'll be happier if you express
your honest opinions to me,

234
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:47,797
instead of apologies.

235
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,092
Supposed to get married...

236
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:56,806
<i>He probably still doesn't know</i>

237
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:03,312
<i>that I don't have supernatural abilities.
I must tell him myself someday.</i>

238
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,691
<i>But now I can't help but hope.</i>

239
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:11,571
<i>I'm hoping I can stay with him
as long as I can.</i>

240
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,744
<i>I'll accept any punishment for it later.</i>

241
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:25,126
<i>So please, let this last a little longer
until I can take responsibility.</i>

242
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:26,878
<i>Until that day...</i>

243
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,892
Oh, Young Master.
Ms. Miyo is taking a bath.

244
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:44,395
Yurie, why are you still here?

245
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,274
"Still here?" Isn't that a bit rude?

246
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:49,901
What is that?

247
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,556
S-Sir!

248
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,766
Is this...?

249
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,061
Settle down and just accept it.

250
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,064
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

251
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:30,316
There's nothing to worry about.

252
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:31,275
But...

253
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,276
Don't worry.

254
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:34,695
Sir...

255
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:38,449
It was you who put it there, right?

256
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,457
<i>A comb as a gift has the meaning
of a marriage proposal.</i>

257
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,459
This one doesn't mean anything special.

258
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,461
You're asking her
to marry you, aren't you?

259
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:54,215
It's only a comb.
I'm saying it doesn't mean anything.

260
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:57,844
Of course, you're right.

261
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:01,639
Ms. Miyo has been using
a half-broken comb.

262
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:07,728
Young Master giving her a new comb
at this time is nothing special.

263
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:12,775
Ms. Miyo is different from any other woman
who has come to this house.

264
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,611
I can't agree with you more, Young Master.

265
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,990
Like I said, it doesn't mean that...

266
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:22,493
I'm sure Ms. Miyo will be very happy.

267
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:27,623
{\an8}Anyway, just go ahead and use it.

268
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:36,757
Thank you very much, sir.

269
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,805
I'll take good care of it
while I'm using it.

270
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:49,187
I guess it's a common domestic squabble
in a family of supernatural abilities.

271
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:52,356
Nevertheless, it's excessive.

272
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,776
At least it's not behavior
expected from a prominent family.

273
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,281
Kanoko Saimori, her stepmother,
must have held a huge grudge.

274
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:05,870
She and Shinichi Saimori were lovers,
but his family forced him to marry

275
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,371
and have a child with another woman.

276
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,291
They were the worst parents.

277
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,793
What about the main issue?

278
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:18,174
{\an8}Yeah. As you assumed, Miyo Saimori
doesn't have supernatural abilities.

279
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:23,971
But her sister Kaya already
had Spirit-Sight when she was three.

280
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,061
That was probably when they started
to treat Miyo, the elder sister, badly.

281
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,690
<i>Oppressed by her stepmother
and younger sister,</i>

282
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,275
<i>without love from her birth father.</i>

283
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,695
<i>She grew up all alone in that family.</i>

284
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:44,909
<i>I bet buying her a new kimono
is not nearly enough to heal</i>

285
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:46,410
<i>the wounds of her heart.</i>

286
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,455
Oh, by the way,

287
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,666
there's one thing that concerns me.

288
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:58,214
Shinichi's first wife,
the birth mother of Miyo Saimori

289
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:01,550
apparently came from the Usuba family.

290
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,469
What?

291
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:10,434
{\an8}It was surprising. I didn't think
the Usuba family actually existed.

292
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:14,689
The Usuba family bloodline has
the supernatural ability

293
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:17,525
to interfere with the human mind.

294
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,443
Is that information accurate?

295
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,444
Yeah.

296
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:24,323
Miyo Saimori's
mother's name was Sumi Usuba.

297
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:28,786
I couldn't find out how
she entered into the Saimori family.

298
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:36,961
Good grief...
I truly feel like I'm not myself

299
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,546
ever since she arrived.

300
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:00,985
{\an8}How foolish. Such nonsense.

301
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:06,157
These are mere simple shiki-gami.

302
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,452
Who could possibly be behind this?

303
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:40,918
