1
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,511
Are you all right,

2
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:13,804
Ms. Miyo Saimori?

3
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:20,519
I-I'm sorry.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,063
Please raise your head.

5
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:27,693
Um, I'm sincerely sorry for bothering you.

6
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:29,278
Please don't apologize.

7
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:32,865
Never mind that, I'm glad
you don't seem to be hurt.

8
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:36,243
Really, I should have been more careful.

9
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:39,830
Thank you so much for helping her.

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,416
Miyo-chan, let's go rest somewhere.

11
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:43,584
Yes...

12
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:45,753
Please be more careful.

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,588
If you would excuse me.

14
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,429
Ms. Miyo, are you all right?

15
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,724
Yes, I'm okay. I'm sorry to worry you.

16
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:01,310
You have to be careful, Miyo-chan.

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,644
Yes.

18
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:04,646
You really should be careful.

19
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:07,399
Because you are...

20
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:10,152
someone very special.

21
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:23,582
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

22
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:46,957
EPISODE 9
DROWNING IN DREAMS

23
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,959
Miyo!

24
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,387
Why did she push herself
until she collapsed?

25
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:07,686
You said you sensed supernatural abilities
when Miyo-chan was having nightmares.

26
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,982
Was supernatural ability being used
on her from somewhere?

27
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,319
With someone from the Usuba family,
that would be possible.

28
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,988
But there weren't any breaks
in this house's barrier.

29
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,866
It's unlikely to be external interference.

30
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:25,495
This is only speculation,
but I think it has something to do

31
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,748
with Miyo being from the
Usuba family bloodline.

32
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,751
Miyo-chan is?! Are you sure?

33
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:34,755
There's evidence that Miyo's mother
used the surname Usuba.

34
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:38,425
She married into the Saimori family
with supernatural abilities.

35
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:42,763
I could have never imagined that Miyo-chan
came from that Usuba family...

36
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:46,183
{\an8}Except that Miyo doesn't have
supernatural abilities.

37
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:50,520
{\an8}Maybe it's possible
the blood of the Usuba family in her

38
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:54,483
{\an8}is somehow harmful to her body...

39
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,196
The blood of the Usuba family...
But why now?

40
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,447
I don't know.

41
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,492
But that's the only possibility now.

42
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,578
Does Miyo-chan know anything
about the Usuba family?

43
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:12,167
Her mother died when she was a child.

44
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,962
She could very well know nothing
about the Usuba family.

45
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:16,546
Besides...

46
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,298
Besides?

47
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,427
{\an8}I doubt she'd talk about it
even if we asked her.

48
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:27,140
{\an8}She seems to be hiding her feelings
more than ever these days.

49
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,686
She probably doesn't want us to worry...

50
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:33,605
But I wish she would at least
let us worry about her.

51
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:57,129
What's the matter?
Did you see a bear or something?

52
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:19,484
A civilian was attacked
by Grotesqueries from the Grave.

53
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:21,611
What is the extent of the damage?

54
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:25,324
A man was found passed out
in the woods near the forbidden area.

55
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:28,535
He's currently in a coma, unconscious.

56
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:30,495
And the situation on the ground tells us

57
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,248
there's no doubt he was attacked
by the Grotesqueries.

58
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,668
So they've already arrived
near human dwellings...

59
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:38,795
That's much faster than our calculations.

60
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,257
We can't count on
the Imperial Household Ministry anymore.

61
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:45,594
{\an8}It's only a matter of time
before they enter the imperial city...

62
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:55,437
{\an8}<i>I can't take it anymore...</i>

63
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,856
{\an8}<i>Why do I keep having...</i>

64
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,775
{\an8}<i>nightmares all the time?</i>

65
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,035
{\an8}<i>How can I study to be
a proper lady like Hazuki</i>

66
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:13,038
{\an8}<i>when I'm back to being how I was before?</i>

67
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,125
<i>Since I fainted, she reduced my lessons.</i>

68
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:21,338
<i>It's a shame that my opportunity to study
is being wasted.</i>

69
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:25,801
<i>Sorry, I have to work overnight again.</i>

70
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:30,055
Then I'll make a meal and bring it to you.

71
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,725
<i>No, it's all right.
You should keep resting, Miyo.</i>

72
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:36,937
<i>Miyo.</i>

73
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,938
Yes.

74
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:41,566
<i>How are you feeling?
Is anything troubling you?</i>

75
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:43,693
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

76
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:46,571
<i>Please don't worry about me.</i>

77
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,824
I see...

78
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,745
<i>Sorry, Godo is calling me.
I have to get back to work.</i>

79
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:57,165
All right. Good luck with your work, sir.

80
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,342
So from what we know, we can assume
the Grotesqueries are advancing

81
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,386
toward the center of the imperial city.

82
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,847
Any information
from the Imperial Household Ministry?

83
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,891
We're trying to get it from them.

84
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:17,727
They are all so slow to act,
it's frustrating.

85
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:20,355
We're going to deploy our men
to encircle the imperial city.

86
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,108
I want it authorized immediately.

87
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:26,111
A large-scale
hunt-and-destroy operation, so to speak.

88
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:29,197
I'll reach out to the Ministry.

89
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,616
Kudo, you proceed with preparations.

90
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,617
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:36,163
We will protect
the imperial city without fail.

92
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:39,374
Wow, it looks good!

93
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:43,128
I was going to do the cooking today,

94
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:47,924
but when I went to the kitchen,
she had already started preparations.

95
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,093
You aren't fully recovered.

96
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:53,513
Please don't worry, I'm fine now.

97
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:55,640
Please go ahead and eat.

98
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,227
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

99
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,774
This is delicious!

100
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:09,571
Ms. Miyo makes me proud
with her excellent cooking.

101
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:11,072
I couldn't agree more.

102
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:13,950
I can't make anything fancy like this.

103
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,286
It's really nothing.

104
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:19,873
You know, I'm really bad at cooking.

105
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:20,790
Huh?

106
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,378
My grades for cooking
were horrible at Girls' School.

107
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,006
Whatever I made would be burnt,

108
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,592
too salty, or too spicy...

109
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:34,554
I'd cut my finger just by holding a knife.

110
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,598
That's hard to believe...

111
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:39,309
You had such a hard time
when you were married, didn't you?

112
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,395
Please, I wish you wouldn't mention that.

113
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,564
I really do regret it.

114
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,149
Regret?

115
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,067
Yes.

116
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,653
My only regret in my life.

117
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:51,947
I'm talking about my marriage.

118
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:57,202
{\an8}<i>I got married when I was 17 years old.</i>

119
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:59,871
<i>Being born the daughter
of the Kudo family,</i>

120
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,290
<i>I was prepared to be married
for political reasons.</i>

121
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,460
<i>My husband was a kind, good man.</i>

122
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,671
<i>I was happy.</i>

123
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:11,800
<i>But... I didn't get along with his family.</i>

124
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,471
<i>Perhaps my lack of skills to do housework
and my immaturity as a person</i>

125
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,432
{\an8}<i>proved to be nowhere near
their ideal traits for a wife.</i>

126
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,143
<i>My husband often comforted me.</i>

127
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:26,231
<i>But one day, we became emotional
when talking about it...</i>

128
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:30,193
<i>and we had a big fight,
which led to our divorce.</i>

129
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:36,199
But you know, when I went back
to my parents' home and calmed down,

130
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,993
I regretted it deeply.

131
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,287
There were many hardships,

132
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:46,167
but living with my family was the most
important thing and I lost it.

133
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:50,005
I could have done something more.

134
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,550
So that is your regret...

135
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,260
Miyo-chan.

136
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:56,261
Yes.

137
00:09:56,344 --> 00:10:01,725
You're trying hard to overcome
your weakness without running away.

138
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,893
I respect you for that.

139
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,145
What?

140
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,063
I don't think it's...

141
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:11,234
From now on, I want you to be
true to your own feelings

142
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:14,821
so that you won't have regrets like me.

143
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,450
What do you want to do, Miyo-chan?

144
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,160
How do you want to live?

145
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,829
Um, well...

146
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,749
<i>I want to be</i>

147
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,419
<i>a wife worthy of my husband...</i>

148
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:33,506
{\an8}<i>I want to be
a lovely proper lady like Hazuki.</i>

149
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,468
<i>My wish is...</i>

150
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:37,552
Miyo-chan?

151
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,347
Are you all right?

152
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,432
Yes... Um, I...

153
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:48,688
I've never thought about
how I want to live, until now.

154
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:52,150
But... there's one thing
I have already decided.

155
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,068
What is it?

156
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:54,778
I want to stay here.

157
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,197
I want to be by his side.

158
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:04,454
He is lucky to have someone
like you care for him.

159
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,586
{\an8}Holy moly, it sure was painstaking
to find every person

160
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,171
{\an8}named Sumi in the imperial city.

161
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:16,674
My hope is Sumi Usuba is in here.

162
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:20,220
It's good we narrowed it down
to a woman named Sumi,

163
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,305
but they all seem like her
and yet not like her.

164
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,851
Sumi Usuba is the only clue
we have about the Usuba family.

165
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:31,398
Keep looking for any information,
no matter how trivial.

166
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:39,864
May I join you?

167
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:43,368
Yes.

168
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:50,333
Miyo, listen.

169
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:54,587
I've been too busy
to find the time to talk with you.

170
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:55,588
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:59,676
It's fine. No problem at all.

172
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,761
Miyo,

173
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:04,597
is anything bothering you?

174
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,599
No. Nothing in particular.

175
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,810
All right, then.

176
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:15,608
Sir, can you tell me what it was like
growing up with Hazuki?

177
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:21,197
Come to think of it,
I haven't told you much about my past.

178
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,366
Is it all right to ask you?

179
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:27,370
We've always been on good terms.

180
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:33,126
Well, she's loud as you know,
so she annoys me sometimes.

181
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,881
Siblings aren't about emotions
such as likes or dislikes, I guess.

182
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:42,510
Being born and raised
in the same environment,

183
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:45,054
we understand each other.

184
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,514
No need to be reserved or sensitive.

185
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,225
Our personalities aren't very compatible,

186
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,395
but I think she's a good person
in her own way.

187
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:55,398
Does that answer your question?

188
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:57,484
Yes.

189
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:01,613
<i>It's very sweet and... I'm envious.</i>

190
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,907
<i>Because I don't have anyone like that.</i>

191
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:05,950
Miyo,

192
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,161
come a little closer.

193
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:10,413
Y-Yes.

194
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:20,548
If you're lonely, say so.

195
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,175
If you are suffering, tell me.

196
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,178
I won't understand if you don't.

197
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,181
I... I'm not lonely...

198
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,683
Really? I miss being with you.

199
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,066
Don't you miss me?

200
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,195
I do miss you.

201
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,823
Then say so from the start.

202
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,492
Yes...

203
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:53,581
You can lean on me.
Tell me your true feelings.

204
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:57,502
Be more selfish. I'll accept you whole.

205
00:13:58,169 --> 00:13:59,087
Yes.

206
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,882
You can show me your emotions
and allow yourself to depend on me.

207
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:06,094
We'll support each other.
That's what a family does.

208
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,099
<i>My husband-to-be is very kind.</i>

209
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,600
<i>But...</i>

210
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,062
<i>If I really let myself be coddled,</i>

211
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:19,107
<i>I know I won't be able to become
a proper wife in the Kudo family.</i>

212
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,236
<i>I've got to solve my problems myself,</i>

213
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:26,114
<i>or I won't qualify to support the family...</i>

214
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,615
Hello, is anybody home?

215
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:28,867
I'll be right there.

216
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,497
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
May I ask who...

217
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:37,750
You are...

218
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:41,379
Oh, hello there. It's been a while.

219
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:44,007
How have you been since
the last time we met?

220
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,551
I'm fine now, thank you.

221
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:49,262
I appreciate the help
you gave me back then.

222
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:51,973
Please don't mention it.

223
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,018
By the way, is Mr. Kudo home?

224
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,520
No, he is at work.

225
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:59,647
Really? That's strange.

226
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,108
I heard he was off today.

227
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,985
He seems to be very busy now.

228
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:07,030
He got called upon on short notice.

229
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,365
Oh, I see.

230
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,534
Forgive me for not confirming beforehand.

231
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:15,163
I'm Arata Tsuruki.
Glad to make your acquaintance.

232
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,290
I'm Miyo Saimori.

233
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:20,043
Yes, I know who you are.

234
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:25,298
It was the talk of social circles

235
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:28,551
that Mr. Kudo finally found a fiancée.

236
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:36,309
However...
I see he is just as heartless as rumored.

237
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,811
Why do you say that?

238
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:43,900
Ms. Miyo, do you realize
how pale your face looks?

239
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,279
He neglected you that day we met,
and he's neglecting you today.

240
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:49,822
See?

241
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:53,743
His fiancée is worn to a shadow
and he isn't aware.

242
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,330
No, it's not his fault.

243
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:02,001
I think it's crazy to make you
work until you faint.

244
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,338
He doesn't understand your true worth.

245
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:09,217
Such nonsense.
He doesn't even speak with you much,

246
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,720
and you're taking lessons on posture,
tea ceremony...

247
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,222
How do you know...

248
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:18,142
There's no value at all
in what he's making you do, is there?

249
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,477
Please stop!

250
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,021
What I'm doing is what I choose to do.

251
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:25,400
I merely asked for his cooperation.

252
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,859
So don't speak ill of him!

253
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:29,821
Are you all right?

254
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,865
I'm fine. Really.

255
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,785
Excuse me for saying things out of line.

256
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,245
I should go now.

257
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,832
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

258
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:44,961
Don't be, because I'm the one
who was being rude.

259
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:45,878
But,

260
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,717
I can give you a role only you can fill.

261
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,138
Please contact me anytime

262
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:57,724
if you're interested.

264
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:04,772
I'll be seeing you.

265
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,861
<i>A role only I can fill?</i>

266
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:12,905
{\an8}He's late.

267
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:17,660
That's disrespectful to you, Commander,
even if he is the envoy from the Ministry.

268
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:22,540
It's all right. We'll just proceed with
the mission preparations without Tsuruki.

269
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,417
You look tired.

270
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,627
No need to worry.

271
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,796
I'll go home as soon as my work is done.

272
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,214
Good.

273
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,176
You should go home today
for the sake of Ms. Miyo.

274
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,802
Right.

275
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,806
You have authorization.

276
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,436
From now on, the command is transferred
to you, and you can direct freely.

277
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,814
Then, we will carry out
the large-scale operations.

278
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,691
We must stabilize the situation

279
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,818
before there is damage
to the imperial city.

280
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,279
Continue your best efforts.

281
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,371
Well, I'm very sorry I was late today.

282
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:07,335
I thought it was your day off,
so I went to your house by mistake.

283
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:13,091
I met your fiancée, Ms. Miyo.

284
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:17,470
She greeted me so politely.

285
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:20,348
You have the best fiancée, Mr. Kudo.

286
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:25,686
But I can't approve of
the way you treat your pretty fiancée.

287
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:27,230
What?

288
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:30,149
Her face looked very pale.

289
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,735
Isn't she getting worse?

290
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,989
I ran into her in town the other day.

291
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:40,368
I helped her when she almost collapsed.

292
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:41,994
Really?

293
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,372
You don't understand at all.

294
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,166
You don't see the real Ms. Miyo.

295
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,836
Or, you probably don't even want to.

296
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,840
The fact that you were not by her side
at such a crucial moment is proof.

297
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:57,760
Although, it's none of my business.

298
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:02,515
Please don't hesitate to call
if you have any problems.

299
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:08,104
I might be able to help you.

300
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,774

301
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:14,277
<i>Among the list of candidates,</i>

302
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,865
<i>there's one person
with no birth or family registration.</i>

303
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,285
<i>The name is "Sumi Tsuruki."</i>

Miyo...?

309

<i>She's pushing herself too hard again...</i>

310
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:06,579
Miyo.

311
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,333
S-Sir?

312
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:14,670
Welcome home, sir.

313
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:16,589
I didn't come to greet you.

314
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:18,591
I'm sorry. I should have...

315
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,761
Sir...?

316
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,262
Miyo, why?

317
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:24,347
Yes?

318
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,349
Why are you losing so much weight?

319
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,100
Why didn't you tell me you fainted?

320
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:30,353
Well, I...

321
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:34,690
Do you think I didn't know
that you have nightmares every night?

322
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,693
I said you could tell me anything.

323
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,820
I told you to rely on me.
Remember?

324
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:43,866
But after all this time,
you still don't tell me anything.

325
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,369
{\an8}Am I that untrustworthy?

326
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:48,037
{\an8}That's not it!

327
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:51,666
{\an8}I didn't want to bother you.

328
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,709
{\an8}You're so busy as it is.

329
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,920
{\an8}I thought you must be tired from work,

330
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,881
{\an8}and I didn't want to cause trouble.

331
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:01,133
{\an8}Tired from work?

332
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,885
{\an8}You're the one who's tired!

333
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,180
If it was going to be like this,

334
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:09,267
I shouldn't have
let you have a chance to study.

335
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,062
Sir...

336
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:14,272
How could you...?

337
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:20,611
<i>No... This is wrong.</i>

338
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,697
<i>I didn't want to talk to her in this way.</i>

339
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:24,156
I...

340
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,533
I only wanted to...

341
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:29,537
Miyo!

342
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,293
<i>I've said the worst possible
thing I could say to her.</i>

343

<i>Doesn't that make me just the same
as the Saimori family?</i>

344
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:44,719
