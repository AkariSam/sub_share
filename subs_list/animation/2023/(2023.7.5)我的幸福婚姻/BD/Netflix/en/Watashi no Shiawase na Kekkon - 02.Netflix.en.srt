1
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:06,422
<i>What a beautiful man.</i>

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:09,883
Are you the new fiancée?

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:10,801
Yes.

4
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:15,055
Remember, while you're here
you must absolutely follow my orders.

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,559
If I tell you to leave, you leave.

6
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:20,561
If I tell you to die, you die.

7
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,771
I won't listen to
any complaints or objections.

8
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:24,314
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:25,441
Huh?

10
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,193
Is there anything else?

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,322
I look forward to living here with you.

12
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:41,331
<i>My new life with Kiyoka Kudo
started this way in a quiet fashion.</i>

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,635
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

14
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:16,927
EPISODE 2
ABOUT MY HUSBAND-TO-BE

15
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:22,933
Please use this room, Ms. Miyo.

16
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:30,357
Thank you for your kind consideration.

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,525
Ms. Miyo.

18
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:32,442
Yes?

19
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:37,447
I'm aware of the bad rumors
about Young Master,

20
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:40,576
but actually, he is a kind man.

21
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,830
Well, I'll excuse myself now.

22
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you, Ms. Yurie.

23
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:56,592
<i>These are high-grade futons.</i>

24
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,846
<i>I thought he'd be more abusive
or treat me with contempt.</i>

25
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:04,182
<i>I was even ready to be
abruptly thrown out of the house.</i>

26
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:12,357
<i>Because I'm from the Saimori family,
he probably thinks</i>

27
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,068
<i>that I have supernatural abilities.</i>

28
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:21,116
<i>If so...</i>

29
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:31,877
Now, I'm going to test you
to see if you have Spirit-Sight.

30
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,881
Miyo, Kaya, sharpen your senses.

31
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:37,633
- Yes.
- Yes.

32
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:41,220
I'm opening it.

33
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:53,690
Ah! Stay away.

34
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:02,157
Kaya!

35
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:05,244
No! Don't come near me!

36
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:10,123
If you were able to see the Grotesqueries,
you have Spirit-Sight!

37
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:14,253
You'll also gain supernatural abilities
one day. Good job, Kaya!

38
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,672
Supernatural abilities?

39
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,677
{\an8}SIX MONTHS LATER

40
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:23,929
How nice.

41
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,684
So you're able to see even more now?

42
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,687
Yesterday, I was able to move
the shiki-gami a bit.

43
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,522
Wasn't I a good girl?

44
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,817
Of course, she has talent.
We are Kaya's birth parents, after all.

45
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,030
{\an8}She isn't like that good-for-nothing
who can't use Spirit-Sight at all.

46
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,450
Ms. Miyo.

47
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,202
It'll be all right.

48
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:51,915
I know what terrible things they say
about me behind my back.

49
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:00,215
I'm useless because
I don't have supernatural abilities.

50
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,133
Ms. Miyo...

51
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:08,223
That must mean I'm not wanted here
just like Mother's cherry tree.

52
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,233
<i>A dream.</i>

53
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:23,697
<i>Oh yes, I don't live
in that house anymore.</i>

54
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:28,243
<i>I have to make myself useful
in this house.</i>

55
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:38,003
Oh my, something smells good.

56
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,427
It looks good.

57
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,012
Ms. Miyo.

58
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:49,848
Ms. Yurie, good morning.

59
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:52,768
Good morning, Ms. Miyo.

60
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:58,148
You just got here, and you're already
making a meal this early in the morning?

61
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:01,401
Um, I'm sorry I didn't ask for permission.

62
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,321
Please don't mention it!

63
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:07,574
You are Young Master's fiancée.

64
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:15,165
It looks delicious!
I'm sure Young Master will appreciate it.

65
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:20,003
Preparing meals is my job,
but as you can see

66
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:22,547
I'm getting to be an old wrinkled grandma.

67
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm really grateful
that you are helping me.

68
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,303
I-I'm glad to.

69
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:32,099
Well, since there's still time
before Young Master wakes up,

70
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,267
I should go do other things now.

71
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:37,562
Ms. Miyo, can I leave breakfast up to you?

72
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,107
Yes, if it's all right with you.

73
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,075
Good morning, Young Master.

74
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,536
Good morning.

75
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,081
Yurie, stop calling me Young Master
in front of others.

76
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,918
Good morning, sir.

77
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:05,882
Young Master, Ms. Miyo prepared
breakfast this morning.

78
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,552
- She did?
- Oh, yes.

79
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:12,389
She was very skilled.
It was helpful for me.

80
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:13,557
Sit over here.

81
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,641
Y-Yes.

82
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,148
You try it first.

83
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,065
Pardon?

84
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:23,567
You can't eat it?

85
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,985
Uh... Well...

86
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:27,070
Did you put poison in it?

87
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,780
How transparent.

88
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:30,949
Poison?

89
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:33,952
I can't eat this because
I don't know what's inside it.

90
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:35,829
Put it away.

91
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:38,540
Try harder next time.

92
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,084
Wait, Young Master?

93
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,294
Young Master!

94
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:50,427
<i>Although my intentions were good,
it turned out to be a massive failure.</i>

95
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,847
SPECIAL ANTI-GROTESQUERIE UNIT

96
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:58,810
I welcome you
to the Special Anti-Grotesquerie Unit.

97
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,774
Through rigorous discipline, I expect you
to heighten your supernatural abilities.

98
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:09,112
Supernatural abilities are a potential
that lies in your spirit.

99
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,699
Telekinesis, pyrokinesis, clairvoyance.

100
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:16,703
Supernatural abilities do not go against
the rules of nature of this world.

101
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:20,123
They are the embodiment
of the power of the spirit.

102
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:24,336
And Grotesqueries have been living
in this nation from ancient times.

103
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:28,882
Often called demons or spirits,
they are harmful to humans.

104
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:35,972
The one and only power to fight them off
is your supernatural ability.

105
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:39,142
So where are these Grotesqueries?

106
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:42,687
Why train if we're never called to fight?

107
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:48,902
That is why we need to prepare for them
so whenever they show up... Huh?

108
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:52,405
- Whoa!
- Uh.

109
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,158
- Oh.
- Ahh...

110
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:01,122
With the passage of time, the number
of Grotesqueries have diminished.

111
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,917
So now, we are rarely mobilized
to eradicate them.

112
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:09,881
That's why serious damage and confusion
are assumed to occur from such incidents.

113
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:13,677
I expect you to be ready to take the lead
and fight the Grotesqueries

114
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,387
when the time comes.

115
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,429
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

116
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:20,183
Come in.

117
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,271
Commander, I've brought
the papers you asked for.

118
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:29,776
I noticed you were exceptionally fired up
for that newcomer training.

119
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:34,197
Oh? Not in a good mood today?

120
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:38,451
Can you hear me? Hello?
Commander Kudo?

121
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:43,206
Hmm? Could it be
that another fiancée has fled your house--

122
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,834
Stop yapping and get out of here already.

123
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,711
I nailed it, didn't I?

124
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:48,962
{\an8}Do you want to be burned?

125
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:52,465
Oops. You seem especially irritable today.

126
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,594
Well then. If you would excuse me.

127
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,476
<i>Young Master, are you listening?</i>

128
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,812
Yeah, I hear you.

129
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:09,357
You really shouldn't have
treated her in that way.

130
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:13,737
Ms. Miyo made a serious effort
to prepare a meal for you.

131
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,656
I can't imagine her
putting poison in your food.

132
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:21,995
<i>It's rare for Yurie to defend someone
to that extent.</i>

133
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:28,877
I can't believe I'm thinking about this.
I must concentrate more on my work.

134
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:37,135
<i>I can't believe I made such a blunder
so soon after moving in.</i>

135
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:43,642
<i>If the rumors about my husband-to-be
are true, maybe I can't stay here anymore.</i>

136
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,145
Your room is ready, Koji.

137
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:49,898
From today, use it as you like.

138
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,733
Thank you very much.

139
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:54,653
You need to start preparing
to enter this family.

140
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:58,782
The days ahead might get busy.
I expect your best efforts.

141
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,200
Y-Yes.

142
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,870
Where should we move this?

143
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:06,331
Move it into my sister's room, please.

144
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,291
Good evening, Kaya.

145
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,086
Oh, it's you, Koji.

146
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,297
I can move that for you, if you'd like.

147
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,715
It must be heavy.

148
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,804
You're kind to other servants too,
not just Big Sister. It's so like you.

149
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,646
Miyo lived in a room like this?

150
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:35,777
<i>If Miyo is thrown out of the Kudo family
with nowhere to go,</i>

151
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,197
<i>I want to be the one
who she feels safe with.</i>

152
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,532
Hey, Koji!

153
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,326
Can I ask you to move this too?

154
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:47,580
Yeah, I'll be right there.

155
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,917
<i>There must be something only I can do.</i>

156
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,839
Welcome home, sir.

157
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:57,882
I...

158
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:58,925
What is it?

159
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:02,595
I want to apologize for this morning.

160
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,014
I overstepped my position.

161
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:12,105
A man of your status couldn't possibly eat
something prepared by one you don't trust.

162
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,858
I should have known better.

163
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:21,739
Everything for supper tonight
was prepared by Ms. Yurie.

164
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:24,200
On my word, I put no poison in it.

165
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:25,994
Please--

166
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,496
It wasn't that I seriously suspected you.

167
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:33,168
I just didn't feel like eating food
prepared by a stranger.

168
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,170
I'm truly sorry.

169
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,435
It's cold.

170
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,937
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,565
You don't have to apologize for that.

172
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:59,444
It seems you keep apologizing
as if it's natural to do so. Why?

173
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,947
- You're not answering me, are you?
- I'm sorry--

174
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:03,948
Don't apologize.

175
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,160
If you apologize too much,
it loses its meaning.

176
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:09,954
Did you eat yet?

177
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,957
Uh, well I...

178
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,335
Why didn't you make a meal for yourself?

179
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,045
Yurie went home already, right?

180
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:18,588
Yes.

181
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,965
Didn't Yurie make a meal for you too?

182
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,468
That's not it.

183
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:28,723
I didn't have an appetite,
so I told her that I didn't need anything.

184
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:30,517
Are you not feeling well?

185
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,019
Don't mind me. It's nothing.

186
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:37,023
All right. As you wish.

187
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,068
I'm done.

188
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,946
Um, then I'll get the bath ready--

189
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:43,905
I'll do it myself.

190
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:45,490
But...

191
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:47,408
I always do it myself.

192
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:50,078
Instead of making a fire
to heat up the water,

193
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,040
it's easier if I use
my supernatural ability to get hot water.

194
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,043
Don't try to do unnecessary things.

195
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:04,634
<i>Since I don't have supernatural abilities,
I can't even draw a bath in this house.</i>

196
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:09,556
<i>I... am not useful for anything.</i>

197
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:16,938
Do you have a minute?

198
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,773
Y-Yes.

199
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:23,278
Sorry for not eating your breakfast today.

200
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,033
Yurie said she'll be
a little late tomorrow morning.

201
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,994
You're in charge of breakfast tomorrow.

202
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,121
Oh, me?

203
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:37,041
If you really attempt to put poison in it,
you're done.

204
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,044
Of course, I won't!

205
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:42,130
No problem, then.

206
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,298
No problem, sir.

207
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:47,010
The bath is still hot.
You should go in before it gets cold.

208
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,553
Uh, um...

209
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:53,099
Thank you... very much.

210
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,563
<i>I couldn't properly thank him.</i>

211
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm aware of the bad rumors
about Young Master,

212
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:06,571
but actually, he is a kind man.

213
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,825
<i>He gave me a chance
to make up for my failure.</i>

214
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,080
<i>I really can't mess it up tomorrow.</i>

215
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,416
<i>Hana!</i>

216
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,710
Hana!

217
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:23,087
Ms. Miyo, what's the matter?

218
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:27,967
They're gone! Heirlooms from Mother,
her cherry blossom kimono... All gone!

219
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,553
What? Why in the world...?

220
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,180
It must be Stepmom Kanoko.

221
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:35,600
I'll go and get them back.

222
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:38,686
But if you confront her alone,
there's no telling what she'll do.

223
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,315
It'll be all right.
I'll tell Father if anything happens.

224
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:50,657
You sure are the daughter
of that conniving thief.

225
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,703
Accusing me of stealing?
Your attitude is unbelievably rotten.

226
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:58,957
What rubbish.

227
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,000
{\an8}You still had this, huh?

228
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:01,960
{\an8}No, don't!

229
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,836
That's Mother's--

230
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:11,970
Think about what you did.
Don't show your face until you're sorry.

231
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:13,972
Close the door.

232
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:20,728
Let me out! Somebody! Father!

233
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,105
Father!

234
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,774
Mrs. Saimori, Mr. Saimori, please don't!

235
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:25,733
Silence!

236
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,486
Who do you think you are? Servant!

237
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:29,696
But it's cruel to Ms. Miyo...

238
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:30,613
Hana...

239
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:34,575
You know what happens when
you challenge me, don't you?

240
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:35,743
Let me out...

241
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:39,163
Somebody, help me...

242
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,294
Again. A bad dream.

243
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,758
<i>I wonder what Hana is doing now?</i>

244
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:58,433
<i>After she was fired because of that day,
I never met her even once.</i>

245
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:02,854
<i>I hope she is happy and doing well.</i>

246
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,114
<i>This is also nearing the end of its life.</i>

247
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,790
Oh, Ms. Miyo. Good morning.

248
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,375
Ms. Yurie?

249
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,253
I see you're up pretty early today, too.

250
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:30,798
Yes. Um, weren't you
going to be late today?

251
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:37,180
Well, I came early today because I was
concerned about what happened yesterday.

252
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:42,727
I'll take care of breakfast,
so why don't you relax in the living room?

253
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,562
Well, actually...

254
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:48,066
Oh my, is that what Young Master said?

255
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:52,528
If he wanted to eat your cooking,
he should have said so.

256
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:55,573
Well, I don't think
that's what this is about...

257
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:57,992
But I'm just not so sure of myself.

258
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:02,872
Then Ms. Miyo,
why don't you let me help you?

259
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,582
Oh, please do.

260
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:12,173
<i>I wonder if this is the right flavor...</i>

261
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:20,098
- That's beautiful.
- I make it all the time.

262
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:23,976
So I'm used to making it fast.
But, there's no guarantee of the taste.

263
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,853
It looks delicious.

264
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:32,110
As a servant, it's an honor to hear
a compliment from a good cook like you.

265
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:42,120
<i>Will he really eat this meal
prepared by someone like me?</i>

266
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,623
<i>This is my last chance.</i>

267
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:48,918
Now, Young Master should be
getting up soon.

268
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,754
Would you please bring the breakfast
to the other room?

269
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,256
Certainly.

270
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:57,593
Good morning.

271
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,846
Good morning, sir.

272
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:11,399
Well, let's eat.

273
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,026
You should eat too.

274
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,987
I-I'm sor...

275
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,904
I mean...

276
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:19,115
I will eat too.

277
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:38,926
It's good.

278
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:47,560
It tastes a little different from
how Yurie makes it, but not bad.

279
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:52,440
Oh, thank you very much.

280
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:57,570
Why are you crying?

281
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:08,581
I-I'm sorry...

282
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,083
I told you not to apologize.

283
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,501
Yes, sir.

284
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:19,926
<i>When was the last time I was praised,
or accepted by someone like this?</i>

285
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,598
<i>Her background is a mystery.</i>

286
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:29,101
<i>She wears such rags
that can't even be called old clothes.</i>

287
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:34,523
<i>Her body is so thin
that she must have had a troubled life.</i>

288
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:40,029
<i>Her hands look so worn from housework.
Is she really from a prominent family?</i>

289
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,115
Yurie.

290
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:47,703
Maybe she wasn't raised as a typical
daughter from a prominent family.

291
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:50,790
I know what you mean. Yes.

292
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,501
Do you think she would tell us
if we asked her?

293
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,920
<i>That might be difficult.</i>

294
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,797
<i>You should discreetly keep an eye on her.</i>

295
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:01,467
I'll do what I can
to look into the Saimori family.

296
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,427
Very well.

297
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:08,140
How unusual, Young Master.
You seem to be interested in this fiancée.

298
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:09,058
Interested?

299
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:15,147
You know, Ms. Miyo might not like you
if you can't express your true feelings.

300
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:18,150
She can dislike me all she wants.

301
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:23,114
Most of the women who came here were
after wealth or status from the start.

302
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:28,160
I think Ms. Miyo will be
a fine wife for you, Young Master.

303
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,413
Why do you seem so sure?

304
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,872
Anyway, I'm counting on you.

305
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,791
Leave it up to me.

306
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:36,627
<i>The Saimori family...</i>

307
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,797
<i>There aren't a lot of bloodlines
with supernatural abilities.</i>

308
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:43,259
<i>I hope there won't be
bad news that comes out.</i>

309
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:48,264
<i>Hey! What are you doing
breaking your promise?</i>

310
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:51,934
<i>Don't you understand
the value that girl has?</i>

311
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,769
What are you talking about?

312
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:57,273
Miyo is none of your business.

313
00:21:57,857 --> 00:22:01,777
Stop messing around!
You made a firm promise that Miyo,

314
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:06,115
who has the blood of the Usuba family,
will be given to the Tatsuishi family!

315
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:40,918
