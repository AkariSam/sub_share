1
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:09,508
<i>The petals fell like rain
dampening my cheeks.</i>

2
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:14,513
<i>I was crying alone
amid the raining petals.</i>

3
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:18,392
<i>The warm sunlight of spring,</i>

4
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,686
<i>the summer sunshine through the trees,</i>

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,189
<i>the sunbeams through the autumn clouds,</i>

6
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:26,692
<i>the morning light reflecting on snow...</i>

7
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,778
<i>None of those would shine on me.</i>

8
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:34,033
<i>I didn't even know what happiness was.</i>

9
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:39,955
<i>After all, any gleam of hope
always disappeared right before my eyes.</i>

10
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,340
<i>I had lived my life always thinking</i>

11
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:55,763
<i>that my existence
was not necessary in this world...</i>

12
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:03,145
<i>Until that day when I met that man.</i>

13
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:10,903
EPISODE 1
THE MEETING

14
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:16,909
This is awful!

15
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:21,413
That green tea is too bitter to drink!

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,373
I'm so sorry.

17
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,459
Go remake it right now!

18
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:30,923
Miyo, don't just sit there bowing.
Hurry up.

19
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,008
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:42,351
Excuse me.

21
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:51,235
I can't believe
she can't even make green tea properly.

22
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:54,696
She should be ashamed
as a member of the Saimori family.

23
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,702
Unlike you, Kaya, she's a clumsy girl.
Just like that mother of hers.

24
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:04,206
Kanoko. Are you trying to blame me?

25
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:07,626
Well, she's your daughter, Shinichi.

26
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,963
Spare me already.
You know it was a long time ago.

27
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:21,473
Good morning, Mr. Tatsuishi.
What brings you here today?

28
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:24,059
I need to have
a little talk with Shinichi.

29
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,104
This is for your servants to eat.

30
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:29,982
Oh, thank you for always being kind.

31
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:33,944
It's my pleasure. I'll be going, then.

32
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,036
Mr. Tatsuishi was just here.
I wonder if it was about a marriage offer?

33
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:48,333
{\an8}The sisters are both getting to that age.

34
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,003
{\an8}Ms. Miyo is 19 years old already.

35
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:56,884
But considering their father's attitude,
it might be for Ms. Kaya and not her.

36
00:02:57,593 --> 00:03:03,640
That's enough chatter, you two.
Those who can't do laundry don't get fed!

37
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,143
- We're sorry, ma'am.
- We're sorry, ma'am.

38
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:09,646
Will someone please
come to the living room?

39
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,025
Hey, Mrs. Saimori is calling!

40
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,276
{\an8}- We'll be right there!
- We'll be right there!

41
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,365
Marriage... offer?

42
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,919
You're sweeping the garden today too?
How diligent of you.

43
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,671
Koji.

44
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:39,301
My father came to have
a head-of-family meeting with your father.

45
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,720
I came as an attendant to him.

46
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,681
It's nice of you to come all the way.

47
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:50,938
Actually, that was my excuse.
I just wanted to talk to you, Miyo.

48
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,738
Miyo, let me see your hand.

49
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,449
Milk...?

50
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,953
Milk caramel.
It's a candy that's sweet and delicious.

51
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:10,374
When I tried it for the first time,
I was completely blown away.

52
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:24,596
I'm glad you liked it.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,349
My older brother loves all things new
and popular and he bought them.

54
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,810
It's very good.

55
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:33,146
If you want, I'll bring you more.

56
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,483
If I can make you smile,
then it's worth the price.

57
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:39,403
Thank you as always.

58
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:45,450
I wish we could
spend time like this forever.

59
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,120
Miyo,

60
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,081
I want to help you.

61
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:55,002
I feel like you're always saving me, Koji.

62
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:02,676
I'm just a plain guy,
but I want to give you strength.

63
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:07,848
I'll do anything for you,
for you to keep smiling.

64
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:10,892
Hope you don't mind.

65
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:24,156
Father, is it okay to buy
a new kimono to wear to Girls' School?

66
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:28,410
Ah, the new semester is starting, is it?

67
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:31,538
In that case,
why don't you go buy a few new ones?

68
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,665
Wow! Really?

69
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:36,043
Thank you, Father!

70
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:40,130
Oh, Shinichi.
You always spoil Kaya.

71
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,883
This kimono is getting tattered.

72
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,593
Miyo.

73
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:47,637
Yes?

74
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:50,891
What do you usually do during the day?

75
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,187
I clean around the house.

76
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:56,813
I see.

77
00:05:57,397 --> 00:06:01,193
Make sure you are here during the day,
the day after tomorrow.

78
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,152
Understood?

79
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:05,989
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:16,958
<i>He told me to be here,
although I'm treated as a servant.</i>

81
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,170
<i>It was an unnecessary request.</i>

82
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:25,467
<i>I never go outside
the boundaries of this house anyway.</i>

83
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,316
Mother?

84
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,986
Have either of you seen my mother?

85
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,989
I think Mrs. Saimori is in the annex.

86
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,991
Are you about to go out?

87
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:53,703
Yes. I'm getting a new kimono made
for the new semester.

88
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,040
But more importantly,

89
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:02,504
Big Sister, shouldn't you wash your face?

90
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,339
You look terrible.

91
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:05,257
What?

92
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,968
Ms. Miyo, you have soot on your face...

93
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,766
Don't you dare greet our guests
looking like that, all right?

94
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,727
You're already the embarrassment of
the Saimori family.

95
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,357
I am sorry.

96
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:37,247
Miyo...

97
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,083
Koji.

98
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:48,592
Good morning. It's rare to see you
wearing Western clothes.

99
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,802
You look very good in them.

100
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:57,100
Um, why did you come here today?

101
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:03,064
Well, there's kind of an important
matter to discuss with your father.

102
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,191
With my father?

103
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:08,403
Here.

104
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:13,074
I brought some sweets.
Please share them with everyone.

105
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,534
Thank you.

106
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:18,705
Well then, I'll be seeing you later.

107
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,709
Koji...

108
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:31,718
<i>Why does it have to be this way?</i>

109
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,350
Ms. Miyo.

110
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,146
Mr. Saimori is calling for you.

111
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,231
What?

112
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,650
You're wanted in the parlor immediately.

113
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,485
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:06,920
You must be here during the day,
the day after tomorrow.

115
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,088
Understood?

116
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:14,094
<i>I shouldn't get my hopes up.</i>

117
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,097
<i>It must be something bad.</i>

118
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,184
<i>A marriage offer from Koji...</i>

119
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,354
<i>I know I shouldn't hope for</i>

120
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,482
<i>something like that, but...</i>

121
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,991
I'm here. It's Miyo.

122
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:36,992
Come in.

123
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:41,621
Pardon me.

124
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,339
Why do you look dazed?

125
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:55,176
Come into the room quickly.

126
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,396
This meeting is about nothing other than
the future of our family.

127
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:11,401
First, the arranged marriage
with the Tatsuishi family.

128
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:17,991
I've decided to let Koji marry into
the Saimori family and take over.

129
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:22,412
The one who will become his bride
and preserve the Saimori family...

130
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,373
is Kaya.

131
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,879
<i>I was prepared for this.</i>

132
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:36,176
<i>Being treated like a servant as I am,
I knew there was no way I could marry.</i>

133
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:41,014
<i>I knew that it would
never be that easy for me</i>

134
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:47,479
<i>to have my existence tolerated
and to spend peaceful days living here.</i>

135
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,691
Miyo, I decided
you should marry and leave.

136
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:56,029
You're marrying into the Kudo family.

137
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:59,032
Kiyoka Kudo will be your husband.

138
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:01,993
K-Kudo?

139
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,453
That's great!

140
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:07,957
You get to be married
to that famous Kiyoka Kudo.

141
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:14,672
That's too good for someone like you
with no redeeming qualities.

142
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:21,221
I'll look forward to seeing
how many days you'll last being his wife.

143
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:27,060
Gather your belongings right away.
You're going to the Kudos' house tomorrow.

144
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,561
Uh, Father--

145
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,979
That is all.

146
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:36,444
If you understood, get ready quickly.
Take extra care to be courteous.

147
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,244
Excuse me.

148
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:55,755
So, Koji. About the schedule for
the engagement ceremony...

149
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,981
It doesn't seem like it'll stop raining.

150
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,150
I went to the trouble of
hanging out the laundry...

151
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,783
<i>Miyo...</i>

152
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,415
Wait, what?

153
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:32,500
Why me?

154
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:37,630
As I said, I'm ordering you to become
the husband of Kaya Saimori.

155
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:40,300
Why all of a sudden?

156
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:42,469
Didn't you say you wanted to help Miyo?

157
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:48,766
Don't worry. I asked Saimori for
Miyo to be Kazushi's wife.

158
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,103
By doing so, she can leave that house.

159
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:57,567
Don't you think that would
set her down the happiest path?

160
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,322
What about Miyo's feelings?
And of all people, Kaya and me?

161
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,283
It's already been arranged.

162
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:09,037
You must follow this decision for
the sake of the prosperity of this family.

163
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:10,830
Do you understand?

164
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,218
<i>My mother's cherry tree.</i>

165
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:28,556
<i>Whenever I was feeling down,
coming here gave me peace of mind.</i>

166
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,851
<i>I guess I won't
be able to come here anymore.</i>

167
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:37,815
<i>Thank you for always being here.
Goodbye, Mother.</i>

168
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,195
Miyo.

169
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,533
Koji.

170
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:48,409
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:53,039
I'm ashamed of my cowardice.

172
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:56,626
In the end, I couldn't do anything.

173
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,212
It's not for you to apologize, Koji.

174
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,383
It's just bad luck.

175
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,885
No, it's not just bad luck...

176
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:10,390
It's all right.
I might find happiness with whom I marry.

177
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,184
I don't blame anyone.

178
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,477
So...

179
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,521
you don't resent me for this?

180
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:20,984
Resent? I've forgotten
that feeling a long time ago.

181
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,447
I wanted to help you.

182
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:30,702
I wanted to be able to laugh with you
in a normal way like we used to.

183
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:31,661
Because I--

184
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,037
Koji?

185
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,163
Kaya.

186
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,166
What are you talking about?

187
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,295
N... Nothing.

188
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,546
Oh, okay.

189
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:44,674
Koji.

190
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:49,762
Thank you for all of your
kindness until now.

191
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,997
Ms. Miyo, may I come in for a minute?

192
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:18,041
Yes, please.

193
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:24,923
I have a message from your father.
He said to wear this kimono

194
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:28,593
when you depart tomorrow.

195
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:29,969
My father said to?

196
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,598
Listen closely, Ms. Miyo.

197
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:38,978
Kiyoka Kudo is rumored to be
a cold and merciless man.

198
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:42,231
Every fiancée has run away from him.

199
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,108
Please be careful.

200
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:47,070
Thank you for your concern.

201
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,114
Your belongings...

202
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,408
That's all you have?

203
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:57,622
Most of what my mother left me
has been thrown away.

204
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,999
This is all I have.

205
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,127
It must have been hard for you.

206
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:08,633
Here, this is for you to eat on your way.

207
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,636
Thank you for your help.

208
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:15,932
Take care of yourself, Ms. Miyo.

209
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:25,024
<i>I don't think a fancy kimono like this
would ever suit me.</i>

210
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,181
<i>I guess I've finally lost my fond memories
as well as a house to call home.</i>

211
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:50,605
<i>Does the head of the Kudo family
really live in a place like this?</i>

212
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,118
<i>Is this the house?</i>

213
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:07,163
<i>It's plainer than I imagined.</i>

214
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,628
KUDO

215
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,296
Hello?

216
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,383
Just a second, please.

217
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:22,845
Who might you be?

218
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:27,099
Nice to meet you.
My name is Miyo Saimori.

219
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:32,146
I'm here because of the marriage
arrangement with Mr. Kiyoka Kudo.

220
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,567
Oh, Ms. Saimori.
We have been waiting for you.

221
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:40,321
I work as a servant of the Kudo family.
My name is Yurie.

222
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,156
I'm glad to make your acquaintance.

223
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:47,703
I've heard a lot about you.
Please come in.

224
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,248
Thank you.

225
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:55,294
The Young Master is in the study now.

226
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:58,798
If you would follow me,
I'll show you the way there.

227
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:04,553
I am very pleased to meet you.

228
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,139
My name is Miyo Saimori.

229
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,226
I hope you treat me kindly here.

230
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:25,866
How long do you intend to bow that way?

231
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,953
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:30,496
I wasn't asking for an apology.

233
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:35,042
Please, you can raise your head now.

234
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,836
Y-Yes.

235
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:45,511
<i>Meeting this man on this day</i>

236
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,807
<i>was like a flower
coming out of the snow.</i>

237
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,935
<i>My life that had been shut off</i>

238
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,022
<i>started to move forward again.</i>

239
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,443
I'm Kiyoka Kudo,
the head of the Kudo family.

240
00:22:06,782 --> 00:22:09,368
<i>What a beautiful man.</i>

241
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,960
