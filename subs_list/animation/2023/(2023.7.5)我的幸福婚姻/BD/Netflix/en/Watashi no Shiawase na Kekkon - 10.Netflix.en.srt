1
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:27,693
Are you conscious?

2
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:32,781
Um...

3
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:36,076
I'm okay now.

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,619
I can walk on my own.

5
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,663
Please put me down.

6
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,462
Are you really all right?

7
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:47,629
Yes.

8
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:50,466
Good.

9
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:09,902
Why are the cherry blossoms blooming?
It's midsummer now.

10
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:11,862
<i>That's strange.</i>

11
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,406
<i>I feel like I've seen this before.</i>

12
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:17,659
Finally, you've come.

13
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:21,413
Mr. Tsuruki...?

14
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:24,082
I was waiting for you.

15
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,669
Welcome to the Usuba house.

16
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:31,965
Usuba?

17
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:44,561
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

18
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:07,895
EPISODE 10
SUMMER CHERRY BLOSSOMS, AND THE MISTAKE

19
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:12,149
I'm impressed that
you found your way here.

20
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,402
Um, why Usuba?

21
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:21,658
Oh, actually, my real name is Arata Usuba.

22
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,785
Tsuruki is my pseudonym.

23
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,371
Arata... Usuba?

24
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:29,958
Yes. I'm part of the same family as you.

25
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,543
I'm your cousin.

26
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,129
From the look of things,

27
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,549
you must already have an idea
why we came here.

28
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:41,178
To stop Miyo
from having nightmares, isn't it?

29
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,181
<i>Miyo's nightmares...</i>

30
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:49,186
The Usuba family's blood
is the cause, isn't it?

31
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,021
I won't deny it.

32
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,066
But to say it more accurately,
the cause of the nightmares is...

33
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,026
Miyo's supernatural ability.

34
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:56,944
What?

35
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,196
Are you saying Miyo has
a supernatural ability?

36
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,448
Yes. I have no doubt she does.

37
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:05,202
Not only that, the ability is dangerous
and powerful.

38
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,913
N-No. That's impossible.

39
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,458
{\an8}Because I was tested for Spirit-Sight
and found to be...

40
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,461
You're right.
Usually, if you don't have Spirit-Sight,

41
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:18,215
it's a sign you won't develop any
supernatural abilities.

42
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,841
Then I cannot have...

43
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:23,053
But the Usuba family has a special kind
of supernatural abilities.

44
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,472
Whether you have Spirit-Sight or not
doesn't matter.

45
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:28,392
You do have a supernatural ability.

46
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:30,477
I am certain of it.

47
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,604
Right, Grandfather?

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,235
You resemble your mother, Sumi.

49
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,488
I'm the head of the Usuba family.

50
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,740
My name is Yoshiro Usuba.

51
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:46,243
I'm Sumi Usuba's father,

52
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:48,954
and Miyo, I'm your grandfather.

53
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:50,747
Oh...

54
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:58,880
Aren't you feeling a bit better now
since coming to this house?

55
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:00,549
Uh...

56
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:03,468
Now that you mentioned it,
my body does feel lighter.

57
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,637
That's because of Usuba's barrier.

58
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,889
If you stay in this house,

59
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,017
your body should be
back to health in no time.

60
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:13,020
What happens if she goes
outside of the barrier?

61
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:15,522
Will she start having nightmares again?

62
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,482
I reckon she will.

63
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,402
Isn't there a way to release her
from her nightmares?

64
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,612
Of course, there is.

65
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:26,783
But if you want Miyo to be saved,
there's one condition.

66
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:27,868
Huh?

67
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,286
Kiyoka Kudo,

68
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,165
will you turn over Miyo to us?

69
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:34,332
What?

70
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,543
What on earth is your intention?

71
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,045
To us,

72
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,714
Miyo's existence is very special.

73
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:44,051
To the Usuba family,
she's worth more than anything else.

74
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:45,635
If so, why now?

75
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,804
Why didn't you ask for her before?

76
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:53,477
Ah... We also didn't think that Miyo would
develop a supernatural ability.

77
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,771
However, just recently,

78
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:59,316
we noticed she was showing signs
of having supernatural ability.

79
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,110
And furthermore,
her ability is a rare kind

80
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,196
among the Usuba family's abilities.

81
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,447
What?

82
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,408
The ability Miyo has is Dream-Sight.

83
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:11,411
It's an ability to intervene
in people's dreams.

84
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:16,625
The reason why Miyo keeps
having nightmares is probably due to

85
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,835
her Dream-Sight ability.

86
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,422
If the Usuba family
doesn't directly control it,

87
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:25,675
someday it will certainly
lead to calamities.

88
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,845
That's how dangerous the ability is.

89
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:31,306
What do you intend to do to Miyo?

90
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,100
It's simple.

91
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,937
We're only trying
to return her to where she should be.

92
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:40,607
As she has developed
the ability of Dream-Sight,

93
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,069
there is no way we can allow her
to be outside the Usuba family.

94
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:46,988
There's no use in trying
to take her away from me.

95
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:47,989
Mr. Kudo.

96
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,618
Just know that we are
giving you this explanation

97
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:54,996
as our utmost consideration for you.

98
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,626
Do you really think
that I'd say yes to your nonsense?

99
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,378
Please keep calm.

100
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,339
This is about the Usuba family.

101
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,133
- Um--
- Stop joking around.

102
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:09,136
Miyo staying with the Usuba family
is not possible,

103
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:12,013
because Miyo is my fiancée.

104
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:14,933
- I said this is about the Usuba family.
- Um, sir--

105
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,935
So you are an outsider.

106
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,937
You've been ignoring her this whole time,

107
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,441
but you seek her because you know
she has a supernatural ability.

108
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,651
Do you think such logic
will go unchallenged?

109
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:27,237
No matter what, I won't let you have Miyo.

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,780
I'll protect her.

111
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:33,410
Do you really think you can protect Miyo?

112
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:34,828
What?

113
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,080
During the Saimori family incident,

114
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:40,292
you let them kidnap Miyo
and she was wounded.

115
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,420
Not only that, you can't stop her
from having nightmares,

116
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:45,380
and you've made her suffer needlessly.

117
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:49,301
Can you honestly say that
you are protecting her?

118
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:54,806
Besides, you have more important things
to do than being here.

119
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,766
The Grave was opened up.

120
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,312
We are in the middle of a national crisis.

121
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:04,191
How can you make the time
to protect Miyo?

122
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:05,317
You bastard...!

123
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:09,362
<i>Because of me,
he pushed himself so hard...</i>

124
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:12,532
<i>And I caused him to worry about me...</i>

125
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:16,870
What do you want to do, Miyo?

126
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:17,871
What?

127
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:20,832
I...

128
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:23,877
{\an8}I...

129
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:31,092
I don't know.

130
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:35,889
{\an8}<i>If I said "I want to be with you" now,</i>

131
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:39,184
{\an8}<i>I would be tying him down forever.</i>

132
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:41,978
I see.

133
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:46,358
So, Mr. Kudo, no amount of talking
would help us reach an agreement.

134
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,860
Let's do this fairly.

135
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:53,615
How about we have a duel
and the winner takes Miyo?

136
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,242
A duel?

137
00:08:55,951 --> 00:09:00,830
If you win, I will teach you the method
to control Miyo's ability.

138
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:06,086
That way, she won't have to suffer
any more nightmares.

139
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,964
I've never meant for
anything like this to happen...

140
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,090
A duel for me?

141
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,342
I accept. I'll take you up on your offer.

142
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:16,680
Thank you.

143
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,225
{\an8}Well, then.

144
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:23,019
{\an8}Shall we have a manly, serious duel?

145
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,192
If you win, the Kudo family

146
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,486
and if I win, the Usuba family

147
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,697
will become Miyo's home.

148
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,324
That goes without saying.

149
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,709
I thought I said a serious duel.

150
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:46,876
This will suffice.

151
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,755
I will not be holding back, you know.

152
00:09:58,847 --> 00:09:59,764
Whoa.

153
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,196
Too slow.

154
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:31,796
Oops, forgive me.

155
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,301
I was aiming for the hilt of your sword
but I seem to have missed it.

156
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,563
Too bad. You missed too.

157
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,694
You certainly are something, as expected.

158
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,573
Your supernatural ability is
no longer effective on me.

159
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:02,077
Oh, yes. I'll tell you
something that's beneficial.

160
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:06,498
In the Usuba family,
most of us with supernatural abilities

161
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:08,833
do not have Spirit-Sight, me included.

162
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,169
Can you guess why?

163
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:15,632
Spirit-Sight is necessary
when battling Grotesqueries.

164
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:21,596
This means, our supernatural abilities
are not for battling Grotesqueries.

165
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,476
The abilities that we have

166
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,229
are for battling humans
with supernatural abilities.

167
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,610
Like this.

168
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,622
What do you think of this?

169
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,874
Aren't you gradually having trouble

170
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,962
believing what you're seeing?

171
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:57,966
You're overconfident.

172
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,013
Amazing power.

173
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:07,392
If a wielder of a supernatural ability
as powerful as you loses control,

174
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:12,689
and tries to hurt somebody,
would anybody be able to stop them?

175
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,320
<i>With Usuba's supernatural abilities...</i>

176
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:22,323
<i>we're the ones that are able</i>

177
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:25,743
<i>to manipulate minds directly, we can!</i>

178
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:42,635
<i>This is why the Usuba family has stayed
hidden in the shadows of history.</i>

179
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,847
We have secretly served Mikado

180
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:50,268
and existed as the ultimate weapon against
rogue wielders of supernatural abilities.

181
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:05,283
What's the matter?

182
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:09,245
Is that all there is to the Usuba family's
supernatural ability?

183
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,497
Astonishing.

184
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:14,250
Nobody has ever reacted
at that speed to my illusions.

185
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:17,754
It's about time to finish up.

186
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,507
I can't let you do that.

187
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,551
The Usuba family cannot lose
to a wielder of supernatural ability.

188
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,930
It's just impossible.

189
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:36,022
As I told you, your illusional ability
is no longer effective on me.

190
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,444
Sir, please stop now!

191
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,533
You'll be caught in their battle
if you get any closer.

192
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,909
Do you want to die?

193
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,918
Can you dodge this?

194
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:11,683
{\an8}It's over.

195
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,689
Sir!

196
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,956
I win.

197
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:47,427
Sir...

198
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,430
Wait, don't go.

199
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:54,434
{\an8}Aren't you going to shoot?
I thought this was a serious duel.

200
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,895
I don't need to shoot.

201
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:00,106
It's clearly settled.

202
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,191
Sir!

203
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:03,693
Miyo!

204
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:05,904
Sir!

205
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:08,990
You are strong.

206
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:09,908
But...

207
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,076
protecting Miyo...

208
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:14,454
Sir!

209
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:16,706
Miyo!

210
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,082
That's my job.

211
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,603
Sir...

212
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,614
<i>The situation is worse than predicted.</i>

213
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:52,659
Did another problem arise?

214
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:53,993
Yes.

215
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,203
According to reports,

216
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:58,373
each one of the Grotesqueries
has been acting alone until now.

217
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,083
But...

218
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,420
now they've started to move in bands.

219
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:07,131
{\an8}That can't be...

220
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,008
{\an8}We need to adapt to their movements

221
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:12,053
{\an8}and change our formations accordingly.

222
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,681
Contact Kudo immediately.

223
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,099
Yes, sir.

224
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,021
I can't believe it!

225
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:25,149
You just came back here
moping after you lost?

226
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,776
With wounds too.

227
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:28,903
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,656
If you have time to apologize,

229
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:34,033
Go and get Miyo-chan back right now.

230
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,411
I can't do that.

231
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:38,705
Huh? What are you say--

232
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:39,872
I lost the duel.

233
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,041
{\an8}I...

234
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,669
{\an8}don't have the right to get her back.

235
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:47,588
Ow!

236
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,090
Hey!

237
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,593
It doesn't matter
what a loser like you thinks.

238
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,013
You can't just leave
poor Miyo-chan like that.

239
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,599
But Miyo wasn't sure...

240
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:02,353
which one of us she should be with,
me or Usuba.

241
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,730
She said she didn't know.

242
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:04,731
You fool!

243
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,692
Think harder about this situation.

244
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,737
No matter how harsh you were with her,

245
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,489
you know she wouldn't say
something like that for revenge.

246
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,742
She blames herself.

247
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:20,121
She thinks she was bad
for not realizing how you feel.

248
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:23,833
<i>She wants so badly to stay by your side.</i>

249
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:28,254
<i>But she knows that
if you turn her away, it's over.</i>

250
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,757
<i>That's why she wanted to improve herself.</i>

251
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,800
<i>She wanted to be needed by you.</i>

252
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:38,431
{\an8}Of course, she was afraid
to confide in you.

253
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,023
{\an8}Then I guess...

254
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,192
{\an8}I really made a big mistake.

255
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:53,529
Pull yourself together!

256
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,491
You are all she has.

257
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:02,038
Understood. I'll be right over.

258
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,542
I'm going to the headquarters.

259
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,294
You're kidding.

260
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:11,172
Are you just going to ignore Miyo
and go to work?

261
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,382
An emergency situation has occurred.

262
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:14,842
But, that's not a reason to--

263
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,928
It's a matter of life or death
for everybody.

264
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:21,682
Suppose I treated my mission lightly,
and there were casualties as a result.

265
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:25,770
That would most certainly
make Miyo blame herself.

266
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:27,438
So I have to go.

267
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:32,777
When I'm done with everything,
I'll bring back Miyo without fail.

268
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,325
If that's how you feel,
try to finish your work in a jiffy.

269
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,578
Okay. I'm going now.

270
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,336
<i>Wait for me, Miyo.</i>

271
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,099
Is anything the matter?

272
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:04,600
Maybe.

273
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,229
<i>I have an uneasy feeling...</i>

274
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:13,734
<i>But I suppose
all I can do now is believe.</i>

275
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,239
It's almost here.

276
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,074
That day will come soon...

277
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:25,746
when everything that poses
a threat to us will cease to exist.

278
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,137
They are finally
approaching the imperial city?

279
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:42,471
Yes.

280
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,433
Please report to me
the movements of the army as they happen.

281
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,227
{\an8}Right. Goodbye.

282
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:54,233
If by any chance
the Special Anti-grotesquerie Unit

283
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,860
can't stop the Grotesqueries...

284
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,530
What will happen to this imperial city?

285
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:04,035
In any case, since Miyo is back here
with the Usuba family,

286
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,205
I shall concentrate on performing my duty.

287
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,292
Hey, Grandfather?

288
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,877
What is it, Arata?

289
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:17,173
How long do I have to wait
until I get my own duty?

290
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:19,550
I don't really know.

291
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,428
Well, don't worry.

292
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:24,805
That day will certainly come
in the future.

293
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,641
And you will have a job to do.

294
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,018
You will have a role only you can fill.

295
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,439
<i>That day has finally come.</i>

296
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,191
<i>Now I must do my job...</i>

297
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:37,652
<i>in a role only I can fill.</i>

298
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,497
Yes.

299
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:56,420
Ms. Miyo, how are you feeling?

300
00:20:58,172 --> 00:21:00,258
Um, how is my husband-to-be?

301
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,094
Is he all right?

302
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:07,598
All I did was send him out
of our property with the barrier force.

303
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:12,311
He arrived home safely, and now he's
back to work as usual, I heard.

304
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:15,731
He sure is coldhearted.

305
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,817
He chose his work over you.

306
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:22,613
{\an8}It turned out fine.

307
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:26,284
{\an8}Everything worked out as it should.

308
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,620
This is how it's supposed to be.

309
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:34,875
Oh?

310
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,503
Mother...

311
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:42,466
Ms. Sumi had the supernatural ability
to connect with people's minds.

312
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,468
She had telepathy.

313
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:45,386
What?

314
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,889
She was able to transmit thoughts
into people's minds.

315
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:51,892
And it is said that a child
of the wielder of that ability

316
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,603
sometimes develops unusually rare
supernatural abilities.

317
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,732
{\an8}And that's the ability you have,

318
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,400
{\an8}Dream-Sight.

319
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:02,653
{\an8}So actually, what I described to Mr. Kudo

320
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:06,407
{\an8}was only just a part of Dream-Sight.

321
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,408
{\an8}What?

322
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:13,122
<i>Dream-Sight ability is the power to enter
any individual's mind while they sleep</i>

323
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:14,540
<i>and manipulate their dreams.</i>

324
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:18,252
<i>All humans need to sleep.</i>

325
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:22,131
<i>So no matter how strong they are,
their minds can be manipulated</i>

326
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:24,717
<i>or even be brainwashed.</i>

327
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,683
But that's not all.

328
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,811
As your Dream-Sight improves,
you'll be able to see in your dreams,

329
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:38,272
the past, present, and future.

330
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:41,567
All of time could be viewed.

331
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,319
Such a powerful ability...

332
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:45,321
And I have it...?

333
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:46,864
{\an8}Excuse me

334
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:49,784
{\an8}for giving you
so much information all at once.

335
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,285
{\an8}Then why...

336
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:54,830
{\an8}didn't my supernatural ability
awaken until now?

337
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:57,833
{\an8}There is a reason for that.

338
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:03,589
{\an8}It's because someone sealed off
your supernatural ability.

339
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:08,469
Sealed off? Who would do such a thing?

340
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:13,099
It was your mother,
Sumi, that sealed off your ability.

341
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:15,559
Mother?

342
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:18,437
Why did Mother do that?

343
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:20,564
I'll have to start the story

344
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:23,651
{\an8}from just before you were born...

345
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:25,736
{\an8}for me to explain the reason.

346
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:31,534
{\an8}<i>I'll tell you everything.</i>

347
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,121
{\an8}<i>I'll tell you why Sumi married into
the Saimori family,</i>

348
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:38,666
{\an8}<i>and why she sealed off
your supernatural ability.</i>
