1
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:06,171
What about...

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:10,926
the others who were at
the Saimori house? Were they all okay?

3
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:12,928
They are all fine.

4
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:15,931
Good.

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,810
You're still worried about them,
after everything you went through?

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,566
More than anything,
I'm so glad you are safe, Ms. Miyo.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,569
Um, how about the house?

8
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:29,695
Completely burned down.

9
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:33,240
Completely burned down...

10
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:39,288
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

11
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:47,379
<i>Will you take me
to the Saimori house once again?</i>

12
00:00:56,263 --> 00:01:01,727
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

13
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:24,935
EPISODE 7
GLAMOROUS LADY OF SUMMER

14
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,664
Watch your step.

15
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:46,915
Okay.

16
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,133
So it's true, it's completely
burned to the ground.

17
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:57,718
Yeah.

18
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:01,722
Having lost their mansion in the fire,
Shinichi and Kanoko Saimori

19
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:05,976
let most of the servants go and are
moving to their villa in the countryside.

20
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,396
Basically a fall from grace, I guess.

21
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,860
Although it's true the Tatsuishi family
caused this to happen,

22
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,320
it's not been made public.

23
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,156
There will be no legal consequences
for the Tatsuishi family.

24
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:21,533
But to take responsibility,

25
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:25,621
their eldest son Kazushi will take
over as the head of the Tatsuishi family.

26
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:28,373
I see.

27
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:34,254
The new head of the family accepted
certain restrictions under my supervision.

28
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:38,050
In effect, the Tatsuishi family will be
under the Kudo family's command.

29
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:41,011
Then, what about Kaya?

30
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:45,974
She will be sent alone as a servant
to a family known to be very strict.

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,978
<i>It would be good for her
to experience the outside world.</i>

32
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:58,779
Kaya.

33
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:01,782
What is it?

34
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,325
I'm going out for a while.

35
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:09,039
Are you okay with so few belongings?

36
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:11,541
What's that? Are you being sarcastic?

37
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:14,711
Kaya. This is a new start.

38
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:17,547
Let's start a new life from here.

39
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,968
We'll rebuild the Saimori family together.

40
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,679
You don't want this to be the end, do you?

41
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,558
Don't talk down to me!

42
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,064
Weren't you going out?

43
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,566
Yeah, I'm going now.

44
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,069
That's nice. Good day.

45
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:15,188
{\an8}This cherry tree was planted
on the day my mother got married.

46
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,607
{\an8}Is this what you wanted to see?

47
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:19,443
Yes.

48
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,612
I felt like my mother was
calling me to come here.

49
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:34,374
What's the matter?

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,626
Um, nothing.

51
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,901
I think what I did was uncalled-for.

52
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,238
Sir?

53
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:09,493
I'm partly responsible for the matter
becoming as serious as it did.

54
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:11,536
That's not true.

55
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,167
{\an8}What you did for me sir,
was not uncalled-for.

56
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,169
Miyo.

57
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,173
You have made me very happy.

58
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,636
Are you done here?

59
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,887
Yes.

60
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,641
You know,

61
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:37,354
the engagement ceremony may be difficult,
given the situation of the Saimori family.

62
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:39,940
The engagement ceremony...

63
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,527
Yeah. It's about our future.

64
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:47,864
I'm thinking of starting the procedures
for us to get married pretty soon.

65
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,452
We might have to go meet
the former head of the family.

66
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,288
The former head?

67
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,207
You mean... your father?

68
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,462
Yeah. He kept pressuring me to look for
possible candidates to be my wife.

69
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,214
I was fed up with it.

70
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:11,012
{\an8}So the marriage offer made to
the Saimori family was from your father?

71
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,765
{\an8}I have to be sure not to let him down.

72
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,350
{\an8}Why would he be let down?

73
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:20,897
The proposal must have been
meant for Kaya.

74
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:29,614
If that happens, I'll turn him
into charcoal, without question.

75
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:31,158
Pardon?

76
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,260
Koji.

77
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,056
Thank you for the other day, Mr. Kudo.

78
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,351
Are you recovering well?

79
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:00,395
Yes, thank you for asking.

80
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:02,439
I'm glad.

81
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,651
Miyo, can I talk to you for a minute?

82
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:20,916
Koji, I'm grateful for what you did
for me the other day.

83
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,251
I didn't do anything.

84
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,421
All I could do was inform Mr. Kudo.

85
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:33,512
No, he said that he was able to rescue me
quickly because of you.

86
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,181
Is that right?

87
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:43,438
I have decided to leave this town.

88
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:45,690
Where are you going?

89
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:49,778
To the old capital.
I want to retrain myself.

90
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,448
I realized how much strength I'm lacking.

91
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:56,451
I don't want to be useless anymore.

92
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:58,578
<i>I'm certain</i>

93
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:02,457
<i>that Kaya will do her best
where she'll be a servant.</i>

94
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,961
<i>I'll try my best too.</i>

95
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:11,466
I want to be strong so I can protect
whom I want when I want.

96
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,680
And... Remember?

97
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,602
A while ago, when we had a talk,
I was about to say something?

98
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:23,937
Huh?

99
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,231
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:29,067
I wanted to help you.

101
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,612
I wanted to be able to laugh with you
in a normal way like we used to.

102
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,489
Because I--

103
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,622
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,624
I'm not sure what you're talking about...

105
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:57,345
I see.

106
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,641
No, it's okay.

107
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:03,893
It's nothing important.

108
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,147
It was good to be able to hear
what you had to say.

109
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:09,608
Well, I guess I should go now.

110
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,153
Miyo, until we meet again.

111
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,377
<i>I’ve got to strive to be better, too.</i>

112
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,512
<i>Our engagement
procedure was a simple one.</i>

113
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:45,018
<i>All we had to do
was write our names on the form.</i>

114
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,690
<i>In the end, the engagement ceremony
was not held by the two families.</i>

115
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:58,698
<i>With our two signatures,
I officially became his fiancée.</i>

116
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,661
KIYOKA KUDO
MIYO SAIMORI

117
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:03,953
Ms. Miyo.

118
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:08,333
Soon you will formally become Mrs. Kudo.

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,002
Mrs. Kudo? Oh my...

120
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,722
Anybody home?

121
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,474
I'll be right there.

122
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,105
Oh, are you Miyo-chan?

123
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,481
Y-Yes.

124
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:37,487
Pleased to meet you. I'm Hazuki Kudo.

125
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,656
I'm Kiyoka's older sister.

126
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:45,412
You're saying you want to redo
lessons to become a lady?

127
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,039
Yes. Is it out of the question?

128
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,125
No, I have no objection to it.

129
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,085
But do you have to?

130
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:57,841
Yes. I'll find the teacher myself,
and I won't cause you any trouble.

131
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:01,052
Please.

132
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:03,930
You don't have to
lower your head like that.

133
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,114
Your face is red.

134
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:22,574
Do you have a fever?

135
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,328
It doesn't seem so.

136
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:30,331
I don't have a fever. I'm fine.

137
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,333
Are you sure?

138
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,837
Yes, it's just that I... Um...

139
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,925
Relax, I'm not teasing you.

140
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,223
Well, I guess it's all right.

141
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,852
Thank you, sir.

142
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,271
I know someone who could be a teacher.

143
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,233
I'll invite her over to our house.

144
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:58,735
Thank you--

145
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:00,320
Don't worry about it.

146
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:04,782
It would just be putting
a person of leisure to good use.

147
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:08,620
A person of leisure?

148
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,626
Please help yourself.

149
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:19,255
Oh, thank you so much.
I was just feeling thirsty.

150
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:23,885
So you are
my husband-to-be's older sister.

151
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:29,641
Yes. Don't we look alike?
People often tell me our eyes are similar.

152
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:32,560
Oh, yes. Um...

153
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,646
Ms. Hazuki.

154
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:37,023
It has been a long time.

155
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:39,484
Oh! Yurie!

156
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,904
It's really been a long time.

157
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:45,532
How many years has it been
since the last time we met?

158
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,034
I'm glad to see
that you're still doing well.

159
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:50,537
You haven't changed, Ms. Hazuki.

160
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,165
Good grief.
You really haven't changed, Sis.

161
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,210
Oh, Kiyoka. Don't you have to go to work?

162
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:58,461
I'm off duty today.

163
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,672
Oh, for heaven's sake!

164
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:03,550
You're always so grumpy.

165
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:07,428
Cheer up. You have this cute fiancée now.

166
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:08,930
It's none of your business.

167
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,306
All right, whatever.

168
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,561
Anyway, Miyo-chan.
Oh, is it okay if I call you Miyo-chan?

169
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,104
Y-Yes.

170
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:22,652
Did you know I was called here by Kiyoka
to give you lessons on how to be a lady?

171
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,112
Pardon?

172
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:27,949
Uh, Kiyoka. You didn't tell her?

173
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,951
Well, I thought I did.

174
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:33,788
I apologize for him.
Kiyoka always neglects explanations.

175
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:38,459
I bet he didn't tell you much about me.

176
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,379
Uh, well... um...

177
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:42,463
It's okay.

178
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:46,467
I'll take responsibility to make you
into a refined lady.

179
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,470
Th-Thank you for taking me on.

180
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,476
It's the season of <i>tenjikubotan</i>, isn't it?

181
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,898
You know, <i>tenjikubotan</i>
is called "dahlia" in other countries.

182
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:01,858
Doesn't it sound lovely?

183
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,319
I just love these flowers.

184
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,779
Come over here, Miyo-chan.

185
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:09,324
Y-Yes.

186
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,625
Do you have a favorite flower?

187
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,835
Well...

188
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,172
I don't know many names of flowers.

189
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:32,013
Ah, those weeds
are called Asiatic dayflowers.

190
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:35,516
Do weeds have names too?

191
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,021
Of course. No matter how small,
all flowers have names.

192
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,273
And they're all beautiful.

193
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,196
Dayflowers only remain open
until around noon.

194
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,034
Still, they stand tall and bloom proudly.

195
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:56,579
You know, I've always felt
that all flowers are beautiful

196
00:15:56,663 --> 00:16:01,668
because they try their hardest
to bloom for the limited time they have.

197
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:05,546
Aren't we the same, Miyo-chan?

198
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,098
Let's try our best to live beautifully
for the limited time we have.

199
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:16,015
Yes.

200
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:19,936
ENCOURAGEMENT OF HOMEMAKING

201
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:27,402
First of all, you want to learn
the proper behaviors of a lady, right?

202
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:28,444
Yes.

203
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,624
I-I'm ready to learn.

204
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:46,713
Actually, I had an unsuccessful marriage.

205
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:51,968
But I graduated from Girls' School,
and have taken a ton of lessons.

206
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:54,679
So I can teach you
the basics with no problem.

207
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,973
You can take it easy, okay?

208
00:16:57,056 --> 00:17:00,977
Um, I... I'm so happy that you came.

209
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:09,235
I can't believe my husband-to-be's sister
came to give lessons to somebody like me.

210
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,988
I'm very honored.

211
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,490
That's good!

212
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,996
Ooh, she's such a good girl!

213
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,791
Kiyoka, can I take her back home?

214
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,709
No.

215
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:31,340
Be generous. She'll learn more if she
buckles down and studies with me.

216
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:32,258
No!

217
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:34,260
I understand.

218
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:39,599
If I took Miyo-chan away from here,
you would be lonely without her.

219
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,268
Th-That's not...

220
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:47,899
Anyway, if you're gonna study, I think
you need some kind of goal.

221
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:50,109
A goal?

222
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:54,489
Yes. If you have a tentative goal,
you can work towards it.

223
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:58,117
There's a party perfectly set
for two months from now.

224
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:04,165
Both Kiyoka and I are invited.
As a first step, you should come with us.

225
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:10,671
You'll be fine. This party is like
a friendly social gathering.

226
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,840
B-But...

227
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,550
Why don't you give it a try?

228
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,928
Sir...

229
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:21,182
All your studying won't mean anything
if you can't put your knowledge to use.

230
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,685
I understand.

231
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,063
Please let me go to the party.

232
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:31,109
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

233
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:34,195
I won't suddenly make you
wear a dress and dance.

234
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,697
Y-Yes.

235
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:41,744
Your basic demeanor is already proper.
You don't have to worry.

236
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:44,580
Do you... think so?

237
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:45,623
Yes.

238
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:50,837
I'll make a timetable for your lessons
by next time. Let's work together.

239
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:52,547
Yes.

240
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:57,718
<i>Ms. Hazuki is kind.</i>

241
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,098
<i>I want to become a splendid lady</i>

242
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,600
<i>like Ms. Hazuki.</i>

243
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,521
<i>I want to be a wife
deserving of my husband.</i>

244
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:21,784
I sense supernatural abilities...

245
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,874
Miyo. I'm coming in.

246
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:35,006
Stop it...

247
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:40,887
You'll be all right. It's all right now.

248
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,398
<i>A nightmare again.</i>

249
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,401
<i>The remnants of
supernatural ability feel similar.</i>

250
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,405
<i>The barrier around the house
doesn't seem broken.</i>

251
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:03,159
<i>It's unlikely
that an outsider has come in.</i>

252
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:05,912
<i>If interference
by supernatural abilities was possible...</i>

253
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,165
{\an8}Usuba...

254
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:42,531
Put the barrier up again!

255
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,700
Pay close attention!

256
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,530
Major General Okaito.

257
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:23,739
Yes.

258
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:25,408
I'm sorry I'm late.

259
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:29,245
I'm sorry to have interrupted
your work, Kiyoka.

260
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,247
It's fine.

261
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,083
I heard Takaihito
has received a revelation.

262
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,587
I'm having a meeting with him,
I'll also report on Tatsuishi.

263
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:41,299
I need you to come with me.

264
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:42,383
Yes, sir.

265
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:48,431
And before we go,
there's something I have to tell you.

266
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:49,390
What is it?

267
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:51,851
There was a tomb break-in.

268
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,353
{\an8}It can't be...

269
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:57,398
{\an8}It's true. We don't have the details yet,

270
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,150
{\an8}but the Grave was opened.

271
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,657
The time has come.

272
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,160
{\an8}We're coming for you,

273
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:10,119
{\an8}Miyo.

274
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,918
