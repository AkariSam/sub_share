1
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:05,587
<i>Deep inside the forbidden area</i>

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:09,174
<i>is the Grave, where those who had
supernatural abilities are buried.</i>

3
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:10,801
<i>That is the place where</i>

4
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:14,763
<i>spirits that turned into Grotesqueries
because of negative sentiments</i>

5
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,933
<i>are meant to be sealed off permanently.</i>

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,186
<i>If it is true that the Grave was opened</i>

7
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:24,023
<i>and the Grotesqueries were awakened...</i>

8
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,943
The imperial city will face
an unparalleled crisis.

9
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,987
It would not be an exaggeration to say so.

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,825
Who was it that broke the seal,
and for what purpose?

11
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:38,454
Prince Takaihito received a revelation
at around the same time.

12
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:40,038
It couldn't be a coincidence.

13
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:44,084
{\an8}Although, he has said
his powers are still unstable

14
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:47,463
{\an8}because he hasn't
succeeded to the throne yet...

15
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:50,841
Nevertheless, we are not
in a position to speculate.

16
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,471
Ah. It's been a while, Mr. Kudo.

17
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:56,722
Mr. Okaito.

18
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,599
Hey, Tatsuishi.

19
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:01,060
Are you going to meet the prince
looking like that?

20
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:04,188
Hmm? I'm not a civilian military employee.

21
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:07,107
I thought there weren't any rules
I have to follow

22
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,484
besides obeying the Mikado.

23
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,153
Can't you show a modicum
of common courtesy?

24
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:13,655
This is my formal attire.

25
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,700
I wish you wouldn't be so uptight.

26
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:19,286
This time only.
I won't let you off the hook next time.

27
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,581
Come now. You should relax more.

28
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,461
{\an8}Excuse me.

29
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,298
{\an8}It's Okaito, Kudo, and Tatsuishi.
We have arrived.

30
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,008
Come in.

31
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,680
It is nice of you to come.

32
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:51,610
MY HAPPY MARRIAGE

33
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,902
EPISODE 8
NIGHTMARES AND OMINOUS SHADOWS

34
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,405
It is nice to see you again,
Prince Takaihito.

35
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:22,034
I am happy to see you are doing well.

36
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:26,538
I am the new head of the Tatsuishi family.

37
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,666
My name is Kazushi Tatsuishi.

38
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:34,671
Even though a member of my family
committed a crime,

39
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:38,008
you have given me permission
to meet you like this.

40
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,928
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

41
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,804
You do not need to worry.

42
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,182
It must have not been easy for you.

43
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,143
{\an8}Thank you.
I am humbled to hear those words.

44
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:51,688
Since then, the Tatsuishi family has been

45
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:55,609
under the control of the Kudo family,
working at their beck and call.

46
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:59,446
We intend to try hard to
restore our good name and your trust.

47
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:03,784
On behalf of Mikado, my father,
I forgive the Tatsuishi family.

48
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,537
You must devote yourself
to make good on your promise.

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,332
I appreciate your clemency.

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,126
{\an8}So, Prince Takaihito.

51
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,129
{\an8}We heard that you received a revelation.

52
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:21,468
{\an8}You must know by now that
the seal of the Grave was broken.

53
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,552
{\an8}Yes.

54
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:30,143
<i>A never-ending night
will come from the underworld.</i>

55
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:33,021
<i>It will be a deep, everlasting darkness.</i>

56
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,234
<i>Beware. A battle is forthcoming.</i>

57
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:43,782
<i>There may be those
who will lose their lives.</i>

58
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,369
So, is danger approaching

59
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,371
this imperial city?

60
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,625
If I foresee anything else,
I shall inform you.

61
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,670
- Yes, thank you, sir.
- Yes, thank you, sir.

62
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,132
Thank you for your time.

63
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:03,385
Kiyoka.

64
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:07,639
What is it, sir?

65
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,642
I heard you got engaged.

66
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:13,145
- Finally.
- Yes.

67
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,064
Your fiancée... well,

68
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:18,984
she may experience many hardships...

69
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,152
Hardships?

70
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:22,904
You should be able to handle it.

71
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,657
Is this a revelation too?

72
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,203
I will bear this in mind.

73
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:39,421
- Uh-huh.
- Um, how am I doing?

74
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:41,006
Let's see.

75
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:44,009
First of all,
try not to hunch your shoulders.

76
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,886
- Yes.
- Keep your eyes to the front.

77
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,430
- Yes.
- A party is a place for socializing.

78
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:53,393
Let's change your posture
which doesn't make you look confident.

79
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:55,562
- Yes...
- Don't forget to smile.

80
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,189
{\an8}Yes.

81
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:59,316
{\an8}Lift the corners of your mouth to laugh.

82
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,779
Oh yes.

83
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:07,074
You know, I once took Kiyoka
to a tearoom that serves sweets.

84
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:10,494
Of course, we ordered some
and they were delicious.

85
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,704
Y-Yes.

86
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:16,833
But Kiyoka was more interested
in something else rather than sweets.

87
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,127
What was it?

88
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:21,588
The pickles that came with the sweets.

89
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:23,924
He stared at my pickles and said,

90
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,009
"Let me have them if you don't want them."

91
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:29,096
He's surprisingly greedy
about food, isn't he?

92
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,348
Did he, really? That is surprising.

93
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,600
Yes, that's it!

94
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,269
Try to smile like that naturally.

95
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:37,854
Yes!

96
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,815
Good response.

97
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,609
Okay, next we'll practice walking.

98
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,362
You need to walk differently
in Western-style clothes.

99
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,364
Y-Yes.

100
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,082
ONE: ETIQUETTE FOR WESTERN ATTIRE

101
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:58,250
TWO: SMILE WHEN GREETING

102
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,376
THREE: TABLE MANNERS

103
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:16,393
<i>Ms. Hazuki is flawless as a proper lady.</i>

104
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:22,232
<i>Taking lessons every day from
somebody like her</i>

105
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:29,656
<i>makes me feel that I'm able to
become like her a tiny step at a time.</i>

106
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,410
<i>I feel like one day, I can be</i>

107
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:36,663
<i>a proper lady deserving of
being next to my husband-to-be.</i>

108
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,172
{\an8}<i>Prince Takaihito might know...</i>

109
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:49,050
<i>It seems as though he foresees
what will happen to Miyo in the future.</i>

110
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,220
<i>What is going to happen to Miyo?</i>

111
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,682
<i>Shinichi's first wife,</i>

112
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,685
the birth mother of Miyo Saimori

113
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:02,439
apparently came from the Usuba family.

114
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:04,566
<i>The Usuba family.</i>

115
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,694
<i>Among the many families
with supernatural abilities,</i>

116
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:11,448
<i>they're said to be
exceptionally unique and dangerous.</i>

117
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:15,118
<i>They have the ability to read minds,
pry into our memories,</i>

118
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:17,954
<i>and even slip into dreams, they say.</i>

119
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,748
<i>Are Miyo's nightmares related to</i>

120
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,958
<i>the supernatural abilities
of the Usuba family?</i>

121
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,544
<i>But there was no break in the barrier</i>

122
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:27,047
<i>nor were there any signs
of external interference.</i>

123
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:30,258
<i>What other possibilities are left?</i>

124
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:35,055
Get ready to be dispatched anytime.

125
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,141
Hmm? Are you going somewhere, sir?

126
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,644
Yes. I'll be back soon.

127
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:44,105
Oh, I bet you're going to see
Ms. Miyo, aren't you?

128
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,858
It's work-related.
I'll be back before it gets dark.

129
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,069
No worries here, sir.

130
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:52,864
What's left is how to introduce yourself,

131
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,575
and the rules of conversation.

132
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:59,037
Also, I need to teach you what to do
when you are bothered by someone.

133
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,998
Thank you very much, Ms. Hazuki.

134
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:04,751
It's for my precious little sister.

135
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:08,838
If I can be of any help, I'll be so happy.

136
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,132
By the way, Miyo-chan.

137
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,717
Yes.

138
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,136
I have just one favor to ask of you.

139
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:19,849
It should be okay now
since we've become so close...

140
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,268
Ms. Hazuki?

141
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,937
That way of addressing me.

142
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:25,772
When you call me,

143
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:28,233
you don't have to say "Ms."

144
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:33,613
I want us to be more like family.

145
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,283
That's what we're going to be.

146
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,910
I want you to depend on me, more and more.

147
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:40,745
I'm sure Kiyoka does too.

148
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,498
He may be grumpy on the surface,
but he'll agree with me.

149
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,667
Family...

150
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:49,296
{\an8}You don't have to be so formal.

151
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,632
{\an8}I would be happy
if you casually call me "Big Sister."

152
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,845
{\an8}Of course, I won't force you.

153
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:58,179
{\an8}Big...

154
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,681
<i>Big Sister.</i>

155
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,685
{\an8}What's the matter?

156
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,186
Well,

157
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:09,691
then is it all right
if I just call you Hazuki?

158
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,319
Yes, of course!

159
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:17,407
Goodbye, Miyo-chan. See you tomorrow.

160
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,577
Yes. I'll be looking forward to it.

161
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:25,332
<i>I want to be near my husband-to-be.</i>

162
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:29,294
<i>I want to become part of his family.</i>

163
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,087
<i>But...</i>

164
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:34,090
<i>what is "family"?</i>

165
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:43,099
It started raining so suddenly.

166
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:46,227
Weather in the summer is a pain
because it changes abruptly.

167
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:50,106
So, did you find any members of
the Usuba family?

168
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,359
I conducted a lot of research, but

169
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:55,695
records and documents concerning
the Usuba family are non-existent.

170
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:59,115
Rumors about them
seem to take on a life of their own.

171
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,367
{\an8}So far,

172
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,953
{\an8}the only clue we have that links
to the Usuba family is Sumi Usuba.

173
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:08,625
{\an8}She's the only person we know of
who went by the family name of Usuba.

174
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,836
{\an8}<i>It's a fact that Sumi Usuba did exist.</i>

175
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,922
{\an8}<i>She married Saimori and Miyo was born.</i>

176
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,883
{\an8}<i>No matter how secretive
the Usuba family is,</i>

177
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:20,595
{\an8}<i>it should be impossible to erase
all traces of her existence.</i>

178
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:21,638
{\an8}Mister?

179
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,307
I want any information you can find.

180
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,394
Let's start with a probe
into this woman named Sumi

181
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:29,354
who lived in the imperial city.

182
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,035
<i>I need to find out</i>

183
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,538
<i>the reason for her nightmares
as soon as possible.</i>

184
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:53,795
H-How was it?

185
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,506
It was wonderful, Miyo-chan!

186
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,049
Thank you very much.

187
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,179
I think you're ready to go into town
and put what you learned into practice.

188
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,059
Miyo-chan, are you all right?
You look tired.

189
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,561
I'm fine.

190
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:11,729
Are you getting enough sleep these days?

191
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:13,481
- Yes.
- Don't push yourself too hard.

192
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,525
Tell me anytime
if you're not feeling well.

193
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:16,651
Yes.

194
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:20,822
{\an8}By the way, I heard that
Kiyoka has been coming home late recently.

195
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,450
His work seems to
require a lot of his time these days.

196
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,327
Today he said
he has to work overnight again.

197
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,579
What?

198
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,582
Ignoring his cute little fiancée
and working all the time?

199
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,083
He's disqualified as a husband.

200
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,710
No, no. I don't think so.

201
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:36,629
His working so hard makes me want to

202
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,715
try my best while practicing with you.

203
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:42,093
Oh my, what a nice smile.
That's the spirit!

204
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:50,602
Commander, the envoy has arrived
from the Imperial Household Ministry.

205
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,104
Finally.

206
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:56,232
<i>But it's miraculous that
the notoriously secretive ministry</i>

207
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:58,818
<i>actually decided to send us someone.</i>

208
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:01,654
<i>It shows the urgency of the situation.</i>

209
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:06,367
<i>Let's try to get him to tell us
everything about what's happening.</i>

210
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:09,037
How do you do?

211
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,039
My name is Arata Tsuruki.

212
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,123
SPECIAL ADVISOR ARATA TSURUKI

213
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,501
I was sent here by
the Imperial Household Ministry.

214
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:16,753
I'm Kiyoka Kudo.

215
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:19,881
The Commander of the
Special Anti-grotesquerie Unit.

216
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,132
Yes, I know.

217
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:24,552
You're even famous in social circles.

218
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:30,058
I heard that you push women away
and are as cold as the tundra.

219
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,352
There's no need for small talk.

220
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:34,729
What I want to hear is
about the Grave, that's all.

221
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,523
Ah, of course.

222
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,274
Well then...

223
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:42,612
As you know, the Grave has been exposed.

224
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:44,572
The Imperial Household Ministry

225
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,325
is rushing to capture
the Grotesqueries that have escaped.

226
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:49,327
What was the aim of the perpetrators?

227
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,497
We're still investigating, but we found

228
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,959
suspicious men collapsed near the scene.

229
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:59,295
We figured they were the perpetrators

230
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,089
but we don't know their motives.

231
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:04,884
What is the reason the ministry
suddenly wanted to give us information?

232
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:07,470
They were reluctant for a long time.

233
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:11,641
Currently, only about 20% of
the Grotesqueries have been captured.

234
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:13,226
There are victims, too.

235
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:16,980
In other words, we are lacking manpower.

236
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,985
It took a while, but the higher-ups
at the ministry finally understood.

237
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:24,988
Is anything the matter?

238
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:27,365
If you don't mind me asking,

239
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:29,826
how did you end up coming here?

240
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,870
You're not employed
by the ministry, right?

241
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:34,080
You're as good as I thought, Mr. Kudo.

242
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:35,331
You are correct.

243
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,626
I'm not affiliated with
the Imperial Household Ministry.

244
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,548
But I've had an association
with the ministry for a long time.

245
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:47,385
Usually, I run a company
called Tsuruki Trading.

246
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:52,974
Since what I do daily
is research and negotiation with clients,

247
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:56,644
{\an8}I accept jobs like this when asked.

248
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:59,606
I see. So you are asked to negotiate

249
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:03,651
when things become entangled,
such as this situation.

250
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:04,569
Yes.

251
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:07,697
In the meantime, before we negotiate,

252
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,367
we've found out some things
about your background, too.

253
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,747
For example,
I heard you got engaged recently.

254
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:19,667
That's wonderful. How lucky you are.

255
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:23,004
I also would like to find a good wife

256
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,590
and settle down soon.

257
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,508
But I'm having difficulties.

258
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,928
Getting married
is not an easy task at all.

259
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,472
Anyway, regarding the matter at hand.

260
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,808
There was an official request,
so we will participate in the operation.

261
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,518
Thank you very much.

262
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:42,315
I'll serve as a liaison from now on,
so I'll be coming here often.

263
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:45,068
I'll be looking forward
to working with you.

264
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,904
Same here. Let's work hard together.

265
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:51,908
I wish you good luck, Mr. Kudo.

266
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,878
- Whoa.
- Oh.

267
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:05,922
This is awful.

268
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:10,301
If you see Grotesqueries,
report immediately.

269
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:13,513
If you encounter them,
engage with multiple forces.

270
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:14,639
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,226
He was found lying down in the bushes.

272
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:22,146
He does have a pulse,
but he's unconscious.

273
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,483
Just like the men described in the report.

274
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,404
This guy is not just a victim, right?

275
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:33,908
No. In all likelihood, he's probably
one of the men who opened the Grave.

276
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,245
That means, even if he wakes up

277
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:39,622
a scary interrogation
would be waiting for him.

278
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,416
Poor guy.

279
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,209
That's a big if.

280
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:47,839
Not one of the men rescued
in this condition has woken up so far.

281
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,425
Why won't they come to?

282
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,011
Nobody has figured out the mystery.

283
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,388
{\an8}The curse of the Grave...

284
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:56,556
{\an8}Yes. It's safe to say...

285
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,811
they had contact with Grotesqueries
that were released from the Grave.

286
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,354
I see.

287
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:07,859
Just so you know, the ability I have

288
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,486
is "kaijutsu," which is
dispelling curses and magic.

289
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,530
It can work on living humans,

290
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,116
but I don't know if I can dispel
the curse of the dead.

291
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:18,453
There's no other way. Just try anyway.

292
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,246
Got it.

293
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:28,713
How should I say...
It's as if something moved in here.

294
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,009
Commander? What is it?

295
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,218
It's just too quiet.

296
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:37,722
There are no sounds.

297
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:57,617
{\an8}Huh? What happened?

298
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,578
{\an8}This curse is...

299
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,332
{\an8}not something I can handle.

300
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,211
Is that...?

301
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:09,504
Stand back.

302
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:29,649
Where...

303
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,567
am I...?

304
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,153
{\an8}Sir!

305
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:43,663
No!

306
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:53,464
Even if you are the spirits
of gifted individuals,

307
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,925
since you've become Grotesqueries
that harm humans,

308
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:56,926
I must destroy you.

309
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:00,680
Sorry, but I'm going to exorcise you now!

310
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,574
We're almost there...

311
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:21,033
Finally...

312
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:24,704
There are already indications.

313
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,665
The awakening is near.

314
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:28,583
Yes.

315
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,209
I will protect her.

316
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,838
{\an8}Because that is my role.

317
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,886
So these are Grotesqueries of the Grave.

318
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:44,473
If they were able
to enter the imperial city...

319
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:47,351
<i>I will never let that happen.</i>

320
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:55,610
Mister, give me some candy!

321
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,694
Sure!

322
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,951
Yes, I think you're doing very well.

323
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,204
Your posture and walking are perfect.

324
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:08,789
Thank you very much.

325
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,374
Okay, let's go.

326
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,960
This is practice for you,
but you should enjoy it too.

327
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:14,962
Y-Yes.

328
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:17,632
<i>Today's practice is in town.</i>

329
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:21,010
<i>My husband-to-be is working hard too.</i>

330
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,512
<i>I must work hard to get better...</i>

331
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:26,474
<i>to become a proper lady
deserving of him as a husband.</i>

332
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:28,601
Ms. Miyo.

333
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,981
Miyo-chan, are you okay?

334
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,858
You look pale.

335
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,736
Hmm? Oh, I'm fine.

336
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:41,906
It's not good to stress yourself.

337
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,991
Nothing good comes from worrying.

338
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,245
{\an8}You are definitely showing growth.

339
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,330
{\an8}So don't push yourself too hard.

340
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:51,832
Yes.

341
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,168
I think we should
go home today after all.

342
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,379
But Hazuki, I can still...

343
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:57,672
No, you can't.

344
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,758
You must go home
and take a good rest. All right?

345
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,261
{\an8}I understand.

346
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:06,347
{\an8}As I said,
you need to stop stressing yourself.

347
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:11,102
{\an8}If you get sick at the actual party,
all your lessons would be in vain.
