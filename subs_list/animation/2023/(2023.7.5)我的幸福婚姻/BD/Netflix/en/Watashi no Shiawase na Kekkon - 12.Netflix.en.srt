1
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,424
<i>Where... am I?</i>

2
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:09,925
<i>What happened since then?</i>

3
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,052
<i>Am I dead?</i>

4
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,442
<i>Is this reality?</i>

5
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,820
<i>Or is this hell?</i>

6
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:36,952
EPISODE 12
LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS

7
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,127
Visualize strongly now.

8
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,213
You will leave your body now.

9
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:52,217
Your soul will be detached
and enter Mr. Kudo's body.

10
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:55,429
Once there, try to find his soul.

11
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:57,222
Yes.

12
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,892
Ms. Miyo... Please be safe.

13
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:02,853
Miyo-chan, I know you can do it.

14
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,106
{\an8}Ms. Miyo...

15
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:11,653
{\an8}Everyone here believes in you
because we all care for you.

16
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,572
Are you ready?

17
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:15,532
Yes.

18
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:19,870
I will surely return...

19
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:21,622
with my husband-to-be.

20
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:23,457
I’m ready to go.

21
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:51,693
{\an8}Sir...

22
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:05,707
This looks like...

23
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,210
The Saimori house...

24
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:39,408
<i>The Grotesqueries which were destroyed
are now reappearing one by one.</i>

25
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:41,869
<i>I was with Godo and the others,
but now they’re gone...</i>

26
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:44,079
<i>What is this place?</i>

27
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:46,498
<i>It certainly isn't the mortal world.</i>

28
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,458
{\an8}<i>All I know is...</i>

29
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:52,713
{\an8}<i>no matter where I am, I cannot die here.</i>

30
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:54,131
{\an8}<i>Sir...</i>

31
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:56,383
Miyo!

32
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,887
Miyo! Where are you?!

33
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,097
If you’re here, answer me!

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,265
Miyo!

35
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,033
Where’s my husband-to-be?

36
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:25,787
Who’s there?!

37
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:27,497
Is anybody there?

38
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:29,541
<i>Over here...</i>

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,086
Wait a minute!

40
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,552
Why...?

41
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,596
<i>Here... Over here...</i>

42
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,476
W-Wait!

43
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,952
You are...

44
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:06,870
Catch me if you can.

45
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,836
What... is this?

46
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,508
<i>This way.</i>

47
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,640
<i>I have to hurry
and find my husband-to-be.</i>

48
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,238
<i>This door...</i>

49
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,865
<i>I recognize it.</i>

50
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,143
Are you...

51
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,564
me...?

52
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:40,922
<i>Miyo...</i>

53
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,594
{\an8}<i>I must go to her.</i>

54
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,022
<i>I was going to bring Miyo back.</i>

55
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:58,815
<i>How pathetic am I...?</i>

56
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,236
{\an8}<i>I must see her once more... and apologize.</i>

57
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:05,864
<i>But...</i>

58
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,115
<i>will I be able to?</i>

59
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,910
<i>No, I have to!</i>

60
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:13,288
<i>I can’t be trapped in a place like this.</i>

61
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,749
<i>I can't die yet!</i>

62
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,252
What are you doing here...?

63
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,256
{\an8}You won't see him.

64
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,174
Why?

65
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,928
You are not... good enough for him.

66
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,764
You’re going to be alone.

67
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,099
Forever.

68
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:35,519
Because it’s easier for you.

69
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,979
That’s how you’ve been living until now.

70
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,400
You know it in your heart, right?

71
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,695
He gave you so much kindness.

72
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,988
{\an8}You flatly refused it

73
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,158
{\an8}and hurt him.

74
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:56,373
{\an8}Because of you, he is now wandering
on the brink of death.

75
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,417
{\an8}Everyone who comes across you...

76
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,378
{\an8}meets misfortune.

77
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,214
{\an8}That’s why...

78
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,300
{\an8}you shouldn’t be beside him.

79
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:09,970
That may be true.

80
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,889
I’m a failure in many ways.

81
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:17,310
I’ve been wanting to change
and stop seeing myself as a failure.

82
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:23,108
As you said,
I’m not good enough to be with him.

83
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,361
I thought so, too.

84
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,071
But...

85
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,615
I don’t anymore.

86
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,617
Since you achieved a supernatural ability?

87
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,828
That doesn’t matter.

88
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:40,333
Thanks to those around me
who care for me,

89
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:46,840
I now feel that it’s all right
for me to be beside him.

90
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,008
{\an8}Don’t lie.

91
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,094
{\an8}You yourself think that it’s easier

92
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:52,888
{\an8}to stay all alone.

93
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,973
{\an8}No. That’s not true.

94
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,349
Don’t lie!

95
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,151
After Mother died,
every day was a living hell.

96
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,445
So before long,

97
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:11,114
you made your heart go numb
so you wouldn't feel anything.

98
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,366
There was no other way.

99
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,785
That was the only way to live.

100
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:22,042
I thought that was my life...
to be living that way.

101
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:27,172
{\an8}But... I believe I can change.

102
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,174
It’s too late to change!

103
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:32,719
You’ve always given up
on every little thing, haven't you?

104
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,391
But... I decided not to give up anymore!

105
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:39,476
It’s impossible!

106
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,560
It’s not impossible!

107
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:41,853
It is impossible!

108
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,897
Giving up is easy,

109
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,191
and you won’t get hurt!

110
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,360
That’s who you are.

111
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:51,321
You hurt his feelings

112
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,823
{\an8}so that you wouldn’t get hurt!

113
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:57,577
So that’s why
I have to apologize to him.

114
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:03,124
My husband-to-be was always on my side.

115
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,295
<i>Although he believed in me,</i>

116
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:10,799
<i>I couldn’t believe in myself.</i>

117
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:13,385
<i>I was scared to get hurt.</i>

118
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,471
It’s all my fault.

119
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,227
Don’t come near me!

120
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,732
The possibility of getting hurt is scary...

121
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,569
but I won’t run away anymore.

122
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:34,739
I believe in my husband-to-be.

123
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:39,286
And because he believes in me,

124
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,246
I'll believe in myself too.

125
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,414
I...

126
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:45,375
I want to be beside him!

127
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:03,059
I’m going to find him and bring him back

128
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:08,690
so that I can live a happy life with him.

129
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,405
I hope... you can.

130
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:33,632
It’s his <i>kumihimo</i> cord.

131
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:37,469
Sir!

132
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,527
<i>Sir!</i>

133
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,286
Miyo...?

134
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,121
Stand back!

135
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,427
What is this...?

136
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,263
Sir.

137
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,474
I've come to take you home.

138
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:34,317
Miyo...

139
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,235
Sir!

140
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:38,321
You're badly injured...

141
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,615
Don’t worry.

142
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,702
It's just a scratch.

143
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:46,913
More importantly...

144
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:08,601
You.

145
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,606
Your Majesty!

146
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,068
What is the situation?

147
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,195
Your Majesty.

148
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,490
A girl who seems to be
part of the Usuba family has appeared.

149
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:25,869
Damned Usuba...

150
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,748
Your Majesty, please rest your body.

151
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:38,256
It's our highest priority now to eliminate

152
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:44,512
the Kudo family which poses a threat to us
as well as the power of Dream-Sight.

153
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:05,909
Miyo.

154
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,161
Sir.

155
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:12,040
{\an8}Please take my hand.

156
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:13,708
{\an8}Your hand?

157
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,667
{\an8}Would you please...

158
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,670
{\an8}believe in me?

159
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:21,925
Of course.

160
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:26,012
Let’s go home... together!

161
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:26,930
Yes.

162
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:37,649
{\an8}Perish!

163
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,943
{\an8}Kiyoka Kudo!

164
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,780
Miyo Saimori!

165
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:45,698
Miyo! It's coming!

166
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,586
{\an8}You pesky little rats!

167
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:12,725
{\an8}Be gone!

168
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:43,339
Where are we?

169
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,102
Miyo...

170
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,647
Although it was my job to protect you,

171
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:02,525
{\an8}you saved me instead.

172
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:07,405
Sir, this...

173
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,992
{\an8}This <i>kumihimo</i> cord

174
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:14,913
{\an8}guided me to where you were.

175
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,957
{\an8}Oh, so that's how...

176
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,628
I thought I had lost it in the battle.

177
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:23,880
I’ll tie it for you.

178
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,591
Can you crouch down, sir?

179
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,176
Yes, thank you.

180
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,560
There, it’s done.

181
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:39,062
Thank you.

182
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:40,980
Um, sir?

183
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:42,565
Hmm?

184
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,694
{\an8}At the Usuba house,
I was asked what I wanted to do,

185
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:49,656
{\an8}and I answered, “I don’t know.”

186
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,574
{\an8}Do you remember?

187
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,034
{\an8}Yes.

188
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:55,328
{\an8}It was a lie when I said I didn’t know.

189
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,330
I’m sorry.

190
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,623
No.

191
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:00,833
I’m the one who should apologize.

192
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,710
Pardon?

193
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:05,421
I didn’t mean to hurt you,

194
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,550
but I lost my temper and I said
something unreasonable.

195
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:11,970
I sincerely apologize.

196
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,347
It’s all right.

197
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:18,559
I... want to be beside you, sir.

198
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,103
Miyo.

199
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:23,231
{\an8}Please let me always be by your side.

200
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:26,901
{\an8}That was always my intention.

201
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:30,488
{\an8}If you don’t mind someone like me,
I want you to be by my side.

202
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:33,992
{\an8}Yes.

203
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:34,993
{\an8}Of course.

204
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:36,661
Good.

205
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,540
I didn’t know what I'd do
if you had said no.

206
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,585
I would never say no.

207
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,267
Kiyoka?!

208
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,393
Ms. Miyo!

209
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,520
- Commander!
- Mr. Kudo!

210
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:03,980
-<i>Miyo!</i>
-<i>Commander!</i>

211
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,148
-<i>Kiyoka!</i>
-<i>Miyo!</i>

212
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,524
<i>Miyo!</i>

213
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:09,402
Everyone...

214
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:11,821
Sir,

215
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,656
everyone is waiting.

216
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,993
Let’s go back together.

217
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,537
Yes, let’s go.

218
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,426
{\an8}- Commander!
- Young Master!

219
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,677
{\an8}Miyo-chan!

220
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,012
{\an8}Commander! Wake up!

221
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,430
{\an8}- Miyo!
- Commander!

222
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:38,931
Miyo-chan...

223
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:40,349
I’m relieved...

224
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,435
Ms. Miyo...

225
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:48,941
Commander!

226
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:52,528
Are we... back?

227
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:53,446
Yes.

228
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:58,076
We were so worried about you!

229
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,833
Sorry... to have made you worry.

230
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:07,585
Sir...

231
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,214
Goodness, don’t cry.

232
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:14,342
Commander!

233
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,094
I’m so glad you’re okay!

234
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:17,345
Hey, Godo!

235
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,847
Don’t cling to me! It's stifling!

236
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,061
Arata!

237
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,856
Um, are you returning home?

238
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,153
My work here is done, it seems,

239
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,364
so I’m excusing myself.

240
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:40,910
{\an8}I really don’t know what to say
about all of this, but...

241
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:42,745
{\an8}You don’t have to mention it.

242
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,707
I just did what I wanted to do.

243
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,625
But,

244
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,085
{\an8}I still can’t...

245
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:52,547
{\an8}go back to the Usuba house with you.

246
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:54,632
{\an8}I’m sorry.

247
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:58,553
{\an8}Don’t apologize for something like that.

248
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:01,097
{\an8}You are family to us.

249
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:04,016
{\an8}Arata Tsuruki...

250
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,478
I’m going to request a rematch someday.

251
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,021
I won’t lose next time.

252
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,235
Very well. I’ll be ready anytime.

253
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:15,653
Until then...

254
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,160
What? That can’t be...

255
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,664
Mikado has already lost
the ability of revelation.

256
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:30,793
{\an8}The fear of not being able
to see into the future

257
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,628
{\an8}has taken over Mikado.

258
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:38,885
{\an8}He committed a sin by opening the Grave
and placing many people's lives in danger...

259
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:40,803
{\an8}We will surely have to...

260
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:45,057
<i>make him atone for it someday.</i>

261
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:53,107
It feels like we were away
for such a long time.

262
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:54,817
It certainly does.

263
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:58,946
Welcome home, sir.

264
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,283
Well, it’s good to be home, Miyo.

265
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:09,207
<i>Thus, my everyday life
regained tranquility.</i>

266
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,711
<i>The restless nights of nightmares
became a thing of the past.</i>

267
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,714
<i>And now, we are finally able
to enjoy having meals together</i>

268
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,258
<i>while having trivial conversations.</i>

269
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,722
<i>The time I am able
to spend with my husband-to-be...</i>

270
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:28,392
<i>is what happiness means to me.</i>

271
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:32,313
<i>These days,
I realize that even more strongly.</i>

272
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,919
{\an8}SEVERAL DAYS LATER

273
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:40,923
<i>Peaceful days flew by quickly.</i>

274
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,591
<i>And before I knew it,</i>

275
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:45,428
<i>the day I was to try out my skills
learned from Ms. Hazuki</i>

276
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:47,722
<i>had come.</i>

277
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:48,931
PARTY DAY!
BREAK A LEG, MIYO!

278
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,745
Miyo.

279
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:14,457
Sir.

280
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,709
Thank you for waiting.

281
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:18,919
{\an8}Uh... uh-huh.

282
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,713
{\an8}Um, sir?

283
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:22,715
How do I look?

284
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:26,218
Oh, you look beautiful.

285
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:28,888
Thank you very much.

286
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:32,808
You look dashing too, sir.

287
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:36,395
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

288
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:38,105
I-I'm sorry.

289
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:42,860
Shall we go?

290
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:44,278
Yes.

291
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:45,988
Miyo.

292
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:51,869
I want to ask you again just to make sure
since we're not in a dream right now.

293
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:54,872
I know how troublesome I can be.

294
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:56,874
But will you marry me?

295
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,461
{\an8}You're not troublesome at all.

296
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:02,880
{\an8}I'm much more trouble...

297
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:06,300
{\an8}How about you?

298
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,761
{\an8}Won't you regret your decision?

299
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:10,471
{\an8}There's no way I'll regret it.

300
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:13,599
{\an8}I'm the one who chose you.

301
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:18,896
{\an8}I know I'm inexperienced,

302
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,981
but it will be an honor.

303
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:25,152
Likewise. It will be an honor.

304
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:40,918
